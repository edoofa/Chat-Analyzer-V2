06/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Austin,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Austin’s higher education?
10/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Austin.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

11/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Austin.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know if you are available to connect with regard to our conversation yesterday?
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 369 7885: I am
11/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A- level?
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 369 7885: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents.  Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Fine Arts) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 369 7885: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Yes I am
11/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 369 7885: I don't quite remember
11/10/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help you recall the steps. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.

If you have any questions please, feel free to ask.
11/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 369 7885: I have no question as of now
11/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
11/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l am
11/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*. I hope you are excited.
11/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l am
11/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Right
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Yes we discussed it
11/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 369 7885: We are
11/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l have
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Ok
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 369 7885: To how much can l reduce my annual fee with the EWYL credits
11/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Evening, we also had paid USD $220 for the seat reservation last year during the visit of Edoofa team visit and meet the parents.
11/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: There is no limit to it, you earn $100 credits every month if you work very hard and consistently.
11/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
11/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 369 7885: Ok
11/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 6:38 am - +263 77 369 7885: No l do not
12/10/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm.

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
14/10/23, 9:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Austin.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Please accept my apologies for the delay in connecting as I had a busy schedule at work. I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
14/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l am
14/10/23, 9:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 9:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/10/23, 9:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 369 7885: Ok
14/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 369 7885: I have
14/10/23, 9:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 9:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 9:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Austin, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 369 7885: I understand
14/10/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes it does
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes
14/10/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 369 7885: No let's continue
14/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 399 9590: Not available
14/10/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 591 3571: Not available
14/10/23, 10:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263773697885 now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 369 7885: Provide more information
14/10/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
14/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l am
14/10/23, 10:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 369 7885: Right
14/10/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes
14/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes l am
14/10/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes
14/10/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 369 7885: Ok
14/10/23, 10:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 369 7885: No l don't
14/10/23, 10:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 369 7885: Yes
14/10/23, 10:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 369 7885: Ok
17/10/23, 11:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Austin,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Thank you
18/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 399 9590: That's true we really need to understand
18/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 399 9590: There is a $300 that is said it will be waved off under early registration what does this mean
18/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 399 9590: And also the amount that need to be paid within 15 days is it $300
18/10/23, 7:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your questions and we have taken note of them @263773999590, I am glad to see that you have jotted down the questions you have on your mind, and rest assured all of them will be addressed. 

As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Ok
18/10/23, 7:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss Austin's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 7:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Austin's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 399 9590: 1.$900
2. 5 years
3.$300
4. $750
18/10/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in Austin's offer letter, his course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for his degree. 

With the scholarship offered, his tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means his annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Yes
18/10/23, 8:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Austin can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Austin will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist him in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Austin as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Ok we hear you
18/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263773999590. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Following questions have been raised are the same as mine
18/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Noted
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Okay , following
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Parents and Austin. Now, moving forward, as you can see in Austin's offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Noted
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Yes
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Clear with that
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 399 9590: But in terms of $750 registration payable within 2 weeks of recieving the offer letter is the period not too short considering how difficult the economy is here is there no room for expansion of the payment period
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 591 3571: The $300 to be waived off on Admission and Procedure fees is within which amount or is it charged separately, also what do they mean by waived off under early registration
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, @263773999590. Let us address this component as well. The admission and processing fee of $300, as mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan for Edoofians. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This special gesture has been granted to the student, considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe. However, it's essential to understand that you are competing for an international scholarship, and students from all over the world are vying for this scholarship seat. Given this, universities have to establish timelines to provide equal opportunities to all students.
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Kindly advice us which of the amounts are to be paid firstly followed by which till the end
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Noted
18/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Noted and following
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263775913571. Now in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Austin through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Yes
18/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Austin's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Austin's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 591 3571: By the way , who is Takudzwa . Though I am clear on the option given
18/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 591 3571: This option would be much favourable
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, @263775913571. I was interacting with one of our other students, and it seems like I mistakenly used his name while addressing Austin. I have edited the message so that we can be on the same page. I appreciate your attention to such details.
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Yes
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 399 9590: So is there a possibility of maybe having another option of the university of preference as a parent and you ensure that Austin get a scholarship there
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Thank you
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 591 3571: What are the ranking ratings for this chosen University
18/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Noted
18/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 591 3571: I think I know his shop
18/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263773999590 @263775913571, I appreciate your curiosity and interest towards the queries you have, but I would recommend holding off on your question for now. As we discussed earlier, our conversation today is designed to address most of the queries you have. If, after our discussion, you still have unanswered questions, we can certainly address them. 

However, sharing such queries in the middle of our conversation might cause us to overlook important details. I hope you understand and will follow through with our conversation first before asking additional questions? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 399 9590: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Ok
18/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Okay
18/10/23, 9:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing our thoughts, @263773999590 and @263775913571. It is great to know that you are familiar with Mr. Rajan. If you are comfortable with the same payment method, you can proceed with making the payment through him.

On a related note, while reviewing Austin's application file, I noticed that you made the payment of his enrollment fee earlier using Mama Money. Could you please let me know if you would like assistance with using the same method for this payment, or if you are comfortable making the payment through Mr. Rajan?
18/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 369 7885: When can l continue with the EWYL program
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Since I left South Africa,I would be comfortable with using Mr Rajan
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Where does that $200 paid before apply
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and that is perfectly fine. You can proceed with making the payment through Mr. Rajan. In regards to the $200 you mentioned, it pertains to the Edoofa Enrollment Fee that you paid in June 2022.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, addressing the query regarding the amount of the $200 fee you paid earlier in June 2022. The same fee does not form a part of your university expenses. Instead, it was a payment made to enroll Austin in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, granting him access to the program's numerous benefits.

This enrollment fee encompasses the cost of university applications, crafting a student's statement of purpose, administrative fees, expert counseling sessions, and participation in the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Training.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As per Austin's course duration, he will be pursuing his education in India for a period of give years, during which he will actively engage in the EWYL program. Over these years spent in India, he will receive training in skills essential to the job sector, enabling him to earn credits independently and further offset his educational expenses.

Essentially, this fee represents Austin's status as an Edoofian and the privilege of having Edoofa as her guardian in India. I trust this clarifies the purpose of the $200 payment you made?
19/10/23, 5:56 am - +263 77 591 3571: Yes, and clarified
19/10/23, 9:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263775913571. Now to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Austin at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
19/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 591 3571: Good morning @918178723499  , thanks for the summary. You have made it simpler for us to understand
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Austin's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 9:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 9:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 591 3571: So if we choose the instalment option to pay the $300 by 31st October and $300 by  November is this  amount included above or it just separate
19/10/23, 9:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up your question, @263775913571. I appreciate your patience, but I am afraid I couldn't fully grasp the details of your query. Could you please provide further clarification or rephrase your question so that I can better assist you in addressing it?
19/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 591 3571: Where does the $750 mentioned above fall under . That's my question
19/10/23, 10:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The $750 mentioned above is the university registration fee, which is included as a part of Austin's first-year university fee totaling $2,800. This fee is paid while Austin is still in his home country to secure his scholarship seat with the university and complete the university admission formalities.

Once Austin arrives in India, the $750 already paid will be deducted from the first-year fee, leaving a balance of $2,800 - $750 = $2,050. I hope this clarifies the question you had?
19/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 591 3571: Noted
19/10/23, 10:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through these messages of mine regarding the Earn While You Learn Program and if we are together so far?
20/10/23, 10:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Austin,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 399 9590: We are following
20/10/23, 10:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see we are still connected, @263773999590. Since we were in the middle of our discussion regarding Austin's offer letter from Galgotias University, may I inquire if we can proceed with our discussion and aim to complete it today? This way, you will have all the necessary details, and you can focus on completing your child's university admission formalities in a timely manner.
20/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 399 9590: Can we do it after work now we are at work
20/10/23, 10:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, @263773999590. I appreciate your commitment to the process. Whenever you are ready to continue the discussion and have had a chance to review the messages, we'll check the most suitable time for us to reconnect and pick up where we left off. 

At the same time, if you don't mind, could you let me know by what time will you be able to review the messages from yesterday and reconnect with us for further discussion? 

This will help us schedule our discussion accordingly and ensure that we can complete our conversation today.
20/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 591 3571: Morning, we did and we are doing logistics to raise the funds and pay to Mr Rajan
20/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 591 3571: 7:30pm
20/10/23, 11:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: @263775913571 it is great to hear that you're actively working on the logistics to raise the necessary funds and plan to make the payment to Mr. Rajan.
20/10/23, 11:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I have also taken note of the timings you shared, @263775913571. However, I hope you are aware that in consideration of the time difference between India and Zimbabwe, our operational hours are typically scheduled from 08:00 am to 04:00 pm CAT. However, we recognize that parents sometimes have work commitments or they are unavailable to connect due to network challenges during the day.
20/10/23, 11:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Therefore, we occasionally extend our availability and schedule operational hours in the evening to assist parents promptly. With that said, I have been available for the parents from 08:00 am to 12:00 am every day this week and hence I am sure you understand that this might not be feasible for me on a daily basis.
20/10/23, 11:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: But considering the importance of our discussion and the offer letter you have, for today, I can certainly accommodate and connect with your family in the evening at 7:30 PM.
20/10/23, 11:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: But @263775913571 considering the time difference, it will be quite late, around 11:00 PM here in India. Therefore, we can only stretch our conversation for an hour or two. Since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, could you please confirm if the network will be stable and if you will be actively available?
20/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 591 3571: Thanks for allowing us to discuss so late. Will be available for 1hr to allow you to rest
20/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 591 3571: During the day I can also respond on incoming messages though I am at work
20/10/23, 11:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for understanding, @263775913571. In that case, if you wish, we can continue with our discussion right now. However, the discussion may not be as smooth as we expect it to be. To ensure a more effective and comprehensive conversation, I suggest we reconnect at 07:30 PM. This will provide us with a dedicated hour for our discussion, making it easier to cover all relevant details. Does that sound good to you?
20/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 591 3571: 👍
20/10/23, 11:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, @263775913571. We will proceed with the discussion at 7:30 PM India time. Please ensure that you and your family have a stable network connection and are actively available at that time. 

Looking forward to our discussion in the evening!
20/10/23, 8:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Austin,

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. In reference to our earlier conversation, I was awaiting a message from your end so that we can proceed with our evening discussion. Since we have not heard from you, I wanted to reach out and check if you are online and available for our conversation?
21/10/23, 6:01 am - +263 77 591 3571: Our network was bad due to rains . Sorry for not getting back in time as planned
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Austin,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Evening to you. Hope we find you well too. I can be available from 9am tomorrow
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @263775913571. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 9 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
27/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 399 9590: Following
27/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 591 3571: Can this video be downloaded for the family to view at home so that we guidance from members
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Austin

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to check your message on Friday, by the time you replied, we were unavailable and hence couldn't attend to your message.
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, after our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
31/10/23, 5:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Austin,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. I was expecting to hear from you yesterday, and I hope all is going well on your end. Today is a significant day for you and your family, as it marks the deadline for your university registration fee. As you are well aware, making this payment in a timely manner is imperative to secure your admission and scholarship.

In this regard, we would like to follow up with you. Have you successfully completed the payment? If so, we kindly request you to share the payment receipt with us. This will aid us in updating the university and ensuring a smooth admission process for you.
01/11/23, 5:19 am - +263 77 591 3571: Good morning @918178723499  , We did not manage to make payment as planned
03/11/23, 12:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Austin,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the endowment plan for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 12:53 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed the message you shared regarding your registration fee, in which you mentioned that you were unable to make the payment as initially planned. I am curious to understand what occurred and what challenges you faced that prevented you from making the payment to secure your scholarship seat with Galgotias University?

If you could provide some insights into this, it would be greatly appreciated so that I can see what is the best possible way forward. <This message was edited>
