25/09/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 755 3969: We can start over if possible
25/09/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
25/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes lm ready we can proceed
25/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.

You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
25/09/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes clear sor
25/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Sir
25/09/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Same applies
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes lm ready
26/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Okay l understand
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes it's clear
26/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I dont have anything to ask
26/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
26/09/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 755 3969: It is all clear for now we can proceed
26/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I'm course lm happy # proud edoofian
26/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I'm with you sir
26/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Same to you
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Im ready
27/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes lm ready
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
27/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 755 3969: How many points are needed basically
27/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university would require at leat 2 passes on the three out of the three subjects.
27/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 755 3969: My network is low
27/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Okay  thank you
27/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you might be able to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes we can continue
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Very clear
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes sir
27/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 755 3969: So when will l pay the $600
27/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Ohh now l get it
27/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I'm following youb
27/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I need more information
27/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 755 3969: So if you get less than 6 points you won't get a scholarship
27/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades.
28/09/23, 7:57 am - +263 77 755 3969: Understood
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Thank you for informing
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes l agree
03/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
03/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 755 3969: You mean if l did not come out with good results this year l can  seat for exams in 2024 lm l right
03/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct and I believe that will not happen.
03/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
03/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
03/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Sure
03/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yah it's clear
03/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/10/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tendai!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
04/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Okay it's clear
04/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I'm fine and you
04/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine too, thank you for  asking.
04/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 755 3969: So far l dont have any query if l have one l will get back to you
04/10/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter? <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes sir l will be proud to be one of the students
04/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai!

06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Thank you so much
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I will be available to discuss with you
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing well. 

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
07/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 755 3969: Yes lm ready to discuss with you
07/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 755 3969: So the university fee and the hostel fee are paid per semester or per annum
09/10/23, 6:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, we would be discussing all the details during our conversation. For that, may I know if you have gone through the offer letter please?
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes l did
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
09/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 755 3969: 1. 900usd
2. 3 years 
3. 300usd
4. 750usd
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Can l ask about the 200usd l first paid
09/10/23, 8:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, may I know what do you wish to ask about the $200 please?
09/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Is it under tution fee or what
09/10/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. Let me help you in getting a clarity on the same. The $200 that you had paid earlier was a part of the $350 Edoofa Enrollment Fee which was used for your enrollment to the Edoofa Program. I hope you are clear about that, right?
09/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 755 3969: So when is the balance needed
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you are asking about the balance enrollment fee, then it is due once you would be done with your admission procedure please. I hope this is clear?
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Okay thank you
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
10/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
10/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
10/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 755 3969: It's clear
10/10/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
11/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 755 3969: Yes we are together
11/10/23, 11:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!

12/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 268 8564: I used the contact above to pay for a relative who started in july.
12/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
12/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.

19/10/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Noted
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Tendai!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I'm ready
19/10/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to knwo dear. Now, on that note, can you please let me know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details so that we can move ahead?
19/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes l have the details
19/10/23, 7:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Sure l did

Yes that will be easy
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Thank you so much
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes it's clear
19/10/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 755 3969: Yes we are together let's move on
19/10/23, 8:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 755 3969: I don have any questions
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
