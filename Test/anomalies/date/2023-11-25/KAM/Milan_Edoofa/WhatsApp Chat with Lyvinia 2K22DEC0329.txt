07/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Lyvinia , 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
07/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
07/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
07/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 461 0266: universities gives you  offer letters
07/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I'm expected to pay my registration fee after chosing an university so that l hold a seat
07/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
07/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Not yet
Which opportunity are you referring to
07/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
07/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
07/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
07/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes sir
07/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
08/09/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Good evening sir
08/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 265 0845: A good evening
08/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
09/09/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely afternoon. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today?
09/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 461 0266: Im doing good and you sir
09/09/23, 9:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
09/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l am
09/09/23, 10:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
09/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
09/09/23, 10:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
09/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 461 0266: No sir
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
09/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 461 0266: Dome
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
09/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes that's nice
09/09/23, 10:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/09/23, 10:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes sir
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 11, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 11, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 11, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 461 0266: No everything is clear sir
09/09/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 461 0266: Please do provide me with information
09/09/23, 10:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
09/09/23, 10:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
09/09/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
09/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes thank you
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
09/09/23, 10:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
09/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 461 0266: I agree
09/09/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 461 0266: So in short how many points should l come out with
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be required to have more than 3 points and above, dear.
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the fact that the three subjects are passed.
09/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 461 0266: Okay thank you
09/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 461 0266: I understand
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes sir
09/09/23, 11:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 461 0266: Notee
09/09/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/09/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
09/09/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 461 0266: Very clear sir
09/09/23, 11:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 461 0266: Thank you very much sir
11/09/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 265 0845: Greetings
11/09/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Lyvinia. How are you doing this lovely evening?

11/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am great too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
11/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Lyvinia, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
11/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes sir
11/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
11/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 461 0266: It went well and my parents think its very fair
11/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
11/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Good evening Sir lf l may ask what happens first?
Is it university offer letter or scholarship percentage
11/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The scholarship percentage will be mentioned the offer letter shared by the university. May I know if you are clear?
11/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Isn't Lyvinia supposed to choose her university if l may ask?
11/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct, after the arrival of the multiple offer letters you will be required to choose one of them for your higher education.
11/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
11/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
11/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Financially not yet ready
11/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges as of now?
11/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yes l am facing challenges in that lately l have been busy paying school fees since schools have just opened
12/09/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Lyvinia. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Thank you for letting me know. In order to help you better with the challenges and to gain a better understand ing of the admission process. I would like to proceed withe the discussion further and after that we can proceed with the concerns. May I know if that works for you?
12/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Afternoon,,yes we can proceed
12/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
12/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l do
12/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Good evening
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 265 0845: If l may ask sir like you said that if we fail to meet the deadlines of the university Lyvinia will be revoked by the university so will she be choosing another university or what??
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for asking a great question. In that case, we shall try to request the university if that does not work out Lyvinia has to choose another university for her higher education. May I know if we are on the same page here?
12/09/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess
12/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess please
12/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess
12/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).
Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess
12/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Very clear
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 265 0845: There is standard registration fee where a student has to pay an admission fee of $500-$750 in the period of the next 15 days
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 265 0845: And then there is the early registration admission whereby a student is deducted$150 from their registration fee which will be payed by edoofa also the amount is paid in 2installments
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Clear
12/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
12/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *1st October* and *1st November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Lyvinia’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
12/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yes we can proceed with Lyvinia's admission process and we have decided to chose the early benefit admission
12/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *1st October* and *1st November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
12/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yes sir
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Lyvinia’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Lyvinia’s higher education well.
12/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Noted with thanks
12/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Thank you so much sir for your time
12/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Please note that Lyvinia's email address is now

20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so curious about the offer letter please and it is quite natural for you to have so many queries. Now, stay assured that I will be helping you in getting clarity on the queries that you have here during our discussion. 

Moving ahead, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Greetings,,Yess we have gone through the letter
20/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 265 0845: 👆 from Lyvinia
20/09/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I have gone through that query of Lyvinia, however, as I have already mentioned that for now let us focus on discussing about the offer letter first so that we all can be on the same page about that and have proper clarity on it. And then I will help you with all the queries that you will have, may I know if that is clear?
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Ok l understand but at the moment Lyvinia is in a lesson at school but soon she wil be available online then we proceed together with her
20/09/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, since Lyvinia is at school, it is completely fine, for now, we can continue with our discussion about the letter, hence, shall we begin?
20/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess
20/09/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, after going through the letter, may you please also answer these questions as well?
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I'm now available
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Lyvinia. May you please go through this message of mine as well dear.
20/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 461 0266: 1.900
2.5years
3.300usd
4.750
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes clear
20/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Understood
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes we are
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l am
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I want to know if the accommodation fee is another fee apart from the University fees 
Like for example my fees at Galgotias is 900usd and accomodation on campus is 2500
Does this make my total fee 3400
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Am l right
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes it is but if l remember correctly the 150 is paid by the edoofa right?
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is completely right! Moving ahead, I will share with you the exact cost breakup as well for better understanding.
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear we are coming to discuss that. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Okay
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Clear
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 461 0266: No we are in Mutare but we can travel to Harare
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Thank you
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Off campus fee does it include food and medical aid
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 265 0845: $2800 plus $750 registration fee am l correct sir please
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. When we consider about the off-campus costs of $800 that are explained in our above discussion, the food costs as well as the accommodation costs are already factored in please. I believe this is clear?
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: No that is not true please. The $750 registration fee is a part of the total per annum costs of $2800. This means once paid, it would then be deducted from the total expenses please. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263714610266 May I know if you are clear with this as well please?
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Ok now very clear
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l am
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
20/09/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
20/09/23, 2:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I want to know about the question l asked you earlier on about what if l have an university of my choice
20/09/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, now regarding that, can you please let me know if you have any specific university in your mind where you wish to study?
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 461 0266: LPU
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Moving ahead, can you please also help me in understanding about why is it that you are inclined towards LPU?
20/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I have been researching about the university for long now and l admire their standards also many edoofians I'm in touch with are there
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess l have a querie ,  l also want to know why did you choose Galgotias university
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here?
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l am clear with that 
So are you trying to say that other universities have rejected my application
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: No Lyvinia, that is not true dear. As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes clear now
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Not aware , explain please
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes it is
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Also is there a possibility that my scholarship percentage might change due to a certain university
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, there is certainly a possibility for that to occur since every university offers the scholarship on the basis of their evaluation and therefore you can expect it to change as well. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes thank you
20/09/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Lyvinia, with that, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?
20/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 461 0266: So if l.may ask have you send my application to LPU also how would l know that they have rejected my application
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we have shared your application with LPU as well and we are expecting a response from their side. In case a student's application is rejected by any university, we make sure to inform them of the same as well.
20/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Okay thank you
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask as well?
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Okay so how would we know that you applied at the LPU
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772650845 LPU is one of the our official partner universities, and when a student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program, their application is shared with all of our partnered institutions including LPU. 

Therefore, you can stay assured about the fact that we have shared Lyvinia's application with LPU as well. Moreover, if you wish to know about if we have done it or not, then once the application will be processed by LPU, we will receive an official application ID against Lyvinia's application from their side and using that you can confirm the same. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes it is
20/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Thank you
20/09/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. On that note, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask for today?
20/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 461 0266: No thank you
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 461 0266: It is nice
22/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lyvinia!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
22/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
22/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 461 0266: It went well
22/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 461 0266: They are actually happy regarding the scholarship
22/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have been working hard to ensure that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address? <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Actually l want to ask what gives a scholarship
Is it edoofa or the university
23/09/23, 7:37 am - +263 77 265 0845: Good morning
If l may ask let's say will opt the off campus option then in regards to food and medical aid will you be covering that for her or what since it was mentioned before that you cover the student's medical aid
24/09/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lyvinia!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
24/09/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Thank you sir for reaching out to us.
We may proceed
24/09/23, 7:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for sharing your queries with us here, regarding that, I would like to mention that the universities are the ones that offer the scholarship, but because the students are a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, they are able to get access to those scholarships and we make it possible for them. This makes it guaranteed for every student to get 50-100% scholarships on their tuition fee. 

Moving ahead, when it comes to off-campus accommodation, yes, please, the food costs are factored in as part of the off-campus accommodation arrangement, and when it comes to the Medical Aid, then all the international students who come to India are required to get themselves a Health Insurance so that god forbid if they happen to be in a tough situation concerning their health, then all the expenses are catered to by the Insurance Company. I believe the queries are clear here?
24/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Clear thank you sir
24/09/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the queries that you had please?
24/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
24/09/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
24/09/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
24/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes
24/09/23, 8:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them? <This message was edited>
24/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 461 0266: We are going to pay in 2parts
24/09/23, 8:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today. It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?
24/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Will let you know when we will make the payment
24/09/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, I would encourage you to finalize a date on when you would be making the payment of the fee so that we can update the university officials as well.

With this, we are done with our sessions for now and since you have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
24/09/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you make the payment of your fee, the university will complete the remaining admission formalities at their end and issue an admission letter. This letter will act as a confirmation of your admission to the university and as a receipt for the paid university registration fee.

Based on the same letter, you will be able to proceed with the visa application process and work on the visa requirements later, are you clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 265 0845: So does that mean we are not to expect any other universities?
24/09/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are following till here?
24/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 265 0845: LPU and CT universities
As a parent just wanted to compare
24/09/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, can you please also let me know why is it that you are inclined towards LPU and where did you get to know about that?
24/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 265 0845: We just want to compare the universities and want to make sure Lyvinia gets enrolled at the best university as well as seeing the scholarship percentages since you said they are offered by the universities
24/09/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. On that note, I believe we have already discussed about the same, right?
24/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Since you were speaking about the visa it seemed as if you had already finalised
24/09/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, I was helping you in understanding more about the letters as well as the admission process please.
24/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 265 0845: If l may ask who gives us the letter to apply for a visa is it the edoofa of the university
24/09/23, 9:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: The letter is issued by the university please, and we will share it with you here.
24/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 265 0845: This is where my concern is 
Lets say Lyvinia gets application letters from other universities and maybe has already received letter from Galgotias what happens then?
24/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 265 0845: And is it possible to receive other offer letters from other universities by this week
24/09/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, since we have already discussed about the same, you would then be able to utilize the transfer option and proceed ahead. Furthermore, we will check with the other universities and see if the offer letter can be arranged in the coming week please.
24/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yes please
24/09/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Before we conclude our conversation for today, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns you wish to share?
24/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 265 0845: As of now we can call it a day then we will continue tomorrow gudnite sir

26/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 461 0266: We don't have a specific date that we are going to make the payment
As soon as my parents find the money then will go and make the payment
26/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, how is it that you are planning to raise the finances for the same?
26/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I think my parents will be able to answer that question
26/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 461 0266: And now they are currently at work
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Good afternoon Mr Singh ,, lm not understanding your question please
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772650845 I wanted to ask about your preparation for completing Lyvinia's admission process, how are you planning to raise the money for that?
26/09/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Will do everything possible to raise the money.Will make sure to work day and night to make sure that we raise Lyvinia's admission fee
26/09/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please! Now, on that note, I am sure that you would complete the admission process before the deadline date, right?
26/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Yess thats our aim to complete before the deadline
26/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 265 0845: If l may ask,, are we going to get  offer letters from other universities before this deadline
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lyvinia!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here, right?
27/09/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Good morning
27/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
27/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 265 0845: Good morning,,LPU and CT universities
As a parent just wanted to compare
27/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
27/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes please
27/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
27/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 461 0266: No
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
28/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lyvinia!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we had here yesterday, where I helped you in understanding more about the Transfer Option and how will we be moving ahead with Lyvinia's admission, may I know if you are clear with that or if you still have any queries to share with me here?
28/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 461 0266: Clear
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to asK?
28/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 461 0266: No please
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
28/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Yes l have
28/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Two parts
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Sir we already discussed about the same

Now, on that note, can you please let me know that if you were able to make the payment or are you planning to do that by tomorrow?

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 5:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lyvinia!

However, from our previous discussions, I believe your father has mentioned that he was planning to make the payment of the registration fee by 03rd or 04th of this month, hence, can you please let me know if you have any update for me regarding that?
07/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 461 0266: As far as l heard him he said that his pay was not yet confirmed and he was following through that to see what was going on

07/11/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that Lyvinia? Do you not wish to move ahead with your admission process when your peers have already completed their admissions and have received the admission letters. Do you not wish to do that as well?

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 461 0266: Noted

16/11/23, 8:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for sharing the same with me here.

16/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 461 0266: I was not aware
16/11/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, won't it be better if we discuss the same with each other here and come to a paymnt plan that works for you?

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
