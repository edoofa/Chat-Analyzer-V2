If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
13/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes let's start
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Okay
13/09/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/09/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 189 0220: They very clear thank you
13/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
13/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
13/09/23, 11:20 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I am following thank you sir
14/09/23, 7:24 am - +263 77 189 0220: Good morning
14/09/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Lynn, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
14/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we can begin
14/09/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 189 0220: They are clear thank u

19/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Good evening
19/09/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Lynn,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 189 0220: We can proceed
19/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
19/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes I was able
19/09/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
19/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Okay the four videos were quite exciting as they covered a lot of issues.The first video talks about past Edoofian have been glad to be given the chance to study abroad
19/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 189 0220: The second video goes on to talk about what the Edoofa program expect from a proud Edoofian as one should always follow instructions and be open minded to make the process an exciting one.The video also mentions a bit about the Earn while you learn program,which is my favourite part of the video as one is given a brief explanation about what the Earn while you learn program does.
19/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Video number three talks about how Edoofa has taken its time in finding the best suitable universities for students over these 10 years and it assured Edoofians that they are going to get the best quality education as well as an experience of a Lifetime
19/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Okay so video number four talks about the Statement of purpose and how students are expected to fill in the form as soon as instructed rather than delaying the process.
20/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Good afternoon
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Evening and you
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
20/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Sure we are on the same page
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 7:30 PM.
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I'm doing a research right now Sir
21/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait for the same.
21/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Thank you
22/09/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I'm as much excited as you are ...I'm finishing up my research and I'm going to answer the interview soon
22/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I am eagerly waiting for the same.
22/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Sure
24/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 189 0220: Answering interview questions
24/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 189 0220: <Media omitted>
24/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 189 0220: 2.Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference I. Human Rights and Civil Rights.


Rights are things that one is entitled to as a human being or a citizen while duties are the things that one is required to do as a member of society.For instance one has the right to freedom of speech,and on the same note one has the duty to use that right responsibly and not to incite violence or hatred.Furthermore , differences have also been observed between human rights and civil rights, although the two terms are often used interchangeably.Human rights are the basic rights that all people have simply because they are human beings whereas civil rights are the rights that citizens of a particular country have under the country's laws.Examples of human rights are the right to life , liberty and security whereas civil rights include the right to vote and the right to a fair trial.To sum it up human rights are recognised by international law whereas civil rights vary from country to country.
24/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 189 0220: 3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?
The key difference between a prosecutor and an attorney is that a prosecutor is a type of attorney but not all attorneys are prosecutors.To break it down further,a prosecutor is an attorney who represents the government in criminal cases.They try to prove that the accused person is guilty.By contrast an attorney is a broader term that can be used to refer to any lawyer including prosecutors,defense attorneys and civil attorneys.A prosecutor works for the government and their job is to gather evidence, present the case in court and try to convince the jury that the accused person is guilty.Defense attorney represents the accused so as to try and prove their innocence and a civil attorney focus on non criminal issues as they solve disputes between organisations and families .All in all a prosecutor is a type of an attorney as the word attorney is very similar to the word lawyer
24/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 189 0220: 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal and why?

As a feminist I wish to study Civil law as I would be associating with different organisations thus I would be able to create an acceptable status for women in Africa.To me personally civil law is really important in terms of protecting the vulnerable people and groups in the society.For example civil law can be used to enforce laws that protect people from discrimination,abuse and exploitation more than defending them against an offense that has already been committed.Through civil law I would like to ensure that women are given their basic rights and treated fairly with dignity.Women should be able to do what their opposite gender does and the only way to achieve this is through the enforcement of civil laws as they play a crucial role in the day to day lives of citizens.
24/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 189 0220: 5.What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer , please elaborate with an example.


I possess various skills needed for one to become a lawyer. I am an excellent reader and writer ,I spent most of my time reading documentaries on women empowerment as whenever a fact excites me I jot it down.
I also possess the skills of critical thinking and problem solving as those are the skill I acquired at my Advanced Level.Given that after reading an extract from a text in Literature one is expected to analyse,give a judgement and suggest solution to the problems being addressed in the passage.
Public speaking is another skill that has made its roots inside the core of my heart.As the 2023 Headgirl of Drake High School,I am entitled to presenting speeches at various occasions.
I also have excellent listening skills as I am able to listen to my fellow students whenever they present their issues to me so that I help consult the teachers or headmaster on their behalf.
Lastly I am good at collaborations and team work .I know how to communicate and work well with others as I am quite tolerant to other people's views .For example when one studies Family and Religious Studies you study various religions they are not acceptable when it comes to one's culture however I find it interesting knowing how how people survive through their cultures around the globe.
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Good afternoon
25/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Lynn.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely evening?
25/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I am doing okay thank you.
25/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I am ready
25/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
25/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 189 0220: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 189 0220: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 189 0220: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes it is accurate
25/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
25/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes I agree
25/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes correct
25/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we are
25/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
25/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 189 0220: That's quite clear thank you
25/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
25/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $750 = $600. This amount can be paid in two installments of $300 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
25/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 189 0220: That's good to know
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, my available hours are coming to an end. We shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further proceedings of our session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I do not have any queries
26/09/23, 3:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Lynn EWYL23E0577*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

04/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lynn!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 09.00 AM CAT. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Noted sir
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lynn!
I hope you are doing well. 

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
07/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 189 0220: Sure I have gone through the letter
07/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 189 0220: Good morning
07/10/23, 9:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
07/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 189 0220: 1. 900 USD
2. 5years (10 semesters)
3.300 USD
4. 750 USD
07/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
07/10/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
07/10/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
07/10/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
07/10/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
07/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 189 0220: Understood
07/10/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
07/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
07/10/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
07/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we are
07/10/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
07/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 189 0220: There is one thing I would like to ask though
07/10/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is it?
07/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we are... when is it supposed to be paid ?
07/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 189 0220: What is the percentage of my scholarship at Galgotias University
07/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Lynn, on that note, may I know if you were able to read the offer letter from Galgotias University properly dear?
07/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes I read it
07/10/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Then as per your understanding how much was the scholarship percentage mentioned in the offer letter please?
07/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 189 0220: 50%
07/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I just wanted to know whether to the scholarship mentioned in my acceptance letter is not valid here?
07/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Good evening
11/10/23, 11:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lynn!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions.

16/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 189 0220: Was in a lesson sorry for the late replies sir
16/10/23, 12:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. May I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes I'm clear sir thank you
16/10/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/10/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lynn!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here please so that we can move ahead with our discussion here?
19/10/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lynn!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Noted Sir.
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Lynn!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:36 pm - +267 75 503 983: Good evening
19/10/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing this evening?
19/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we are to ready for the session.
19/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Very well thank you,and you
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am doing exceptionally fine too, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
19/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes we can proceed
19/10/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/10/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes clearly understood
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 189 0220: However I have a slight question.
19/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Given my current financial status if I delay the payment perhaps maybe till December will I loose my scholarship ?
19/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Where is Galgotias University located in India?
19/10/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding about the challenges that you are facing in terms of raising the finances for your admission process?
19/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 189 0220: My father is not responding to the payments that should be paid and my mom is not professionally employed so I wanted to know if you can extend the time so I can get the chance to work after I finish my exams so I can pay the needed fees.
20/10/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lynn!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here dear. Now, on that note, I understand where you are coming from, however, what I wanted to know here is the reason that your father is not responding to the same?
20/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 189 0220: According to him ,he has been having problems financially.
20/10/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what are the challenges that he has been facing due to which he cannot manage to complete the registration process?
20/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 189 0220: I don't really know,like I said before I don't stay with my dad so I barely interact with him physically to know much.All he said is that things are not working out on his side as he is into small scale mining.
20/10/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you get him to connect with me here so that we can move ahead with discussing the same please?
20/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Okay I will try to get him online
20/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Unfortunately I am unable to reach him at the moment,I last talked to him a few days ago.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please give me his contact number so that I can try to get in touch with him dear?
21/10/23, 7:45 am - +263 77 189 0220: Baba Lyee.vcf (file attached)

I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
17/11/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please Lynn. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you were able to have a discussion with your father till now?
18/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
18/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 77 189 0220: I was able to discuss with him
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lynn!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Good evening sir
23/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes I am ready
23/11/23, 8:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Lynn, as per the discussion that you had with your parents, how are they planning to complete your admission process?
23/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 189 0220: If possible they want to pay the admission fee next year January after getting my A level results
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what is the reason behind that since, if you wish to complete your admission process in the coming year, then you would be losing on the Endowment Plan Benefits?
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 189 0220: The money is not available right now Sir.
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 189 0220: What are endowment plan benefits sir ?
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lynn, on that note, I hope you would recall that your admission officer Mr. Shivjeet had discussed the same with you earlier, right?
23/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Yes
23/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 189 0220: If I pay the admission fee by January would the scholarship be cancelled?
23/11/23, 8:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, since we are already past the deadline date, in that case, waiting till January will eventually lead to the university canceling the offer. Along with that, you won't be getting the Endowment Plan Benefits, too. I hope you understand?
23/11/23, 9:03 pm - +267 75 503 983: Good evening sir,it's Lynn's mother
23/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to connect with you here mam. How are you doing today?
23/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 189 0220: Okay noted , will I still be an Edoofian
23/11/23, 9:15 pm - +267 75 503 983: I'm good and you,sorry for not available,
23/11/23, 9:15 pm - +267 75 503 983: I have a question concerning the scholarship of my child
23/11/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please sure, you can ask me? What is it?
23/11/23, 9:24 pm - +267 75 503 983: My child paid full money for seat reserve,$350,what I want to know is what's the guarantee that my child is fully an edoofian,because I don't have any solid thing in my hand from your organization that prove or shows my daughter has made the payments,only the receipts from the bank  now you want her to pay admission  fee,as a parent and current situation of our economy, I want to be secured
23/11/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if I may ask, do you recall getting the Acceptance Letter from Edoofa?
23/11/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:01 pm - +267 75 503 983: Some of this things,as parents to be truly,we don't get it,the pdf or acceptance letter is on air/phone but on we have nothing to hold on it,please sir don't be offended by the questions I'm raising,as a single mother education to my child is like a treasure,I was thinking that maybe,other payments and processes will be made when the results  are out and when she had the access to visa,please sir
23/11/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns, and your questions are completely valid. Let me reassure you regarding the process and your daughter's status as an Edoofian.

While I acknowledge that the Acceptance Letter being digital might raise uncertainties, it's essential to note that the receipts of payments made, including the seat reservation fee, serve as tangible evidence. This confirms your daughter's reserved seat within Edoofa's programs. I hope you understand the same?
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for joining today's session. As my available hours are concluding, and it has been a long day, I'll be closing our session for now. Let's reconvene tomorrow starting from 01:00 PM to continue our discussion. Have a wonderful evening, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
