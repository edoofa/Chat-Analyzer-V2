14/08/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 121 8434: Am ready
14/08/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 121 8434: Am done
14/08/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
14/08/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: So the counseling session here that is about 1 hour , will l be using this same platform ?
14/08/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
14/08/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you will be using the same platform.
14/08/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Okay noted . thank you
14/08/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Very clear
14/08/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes please
14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM

14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Shall be done by 1:30 PM
14/08/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, I shall wait for your response.
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Am actually done .so do l give a summary of all the four videos at once one or l can do it later
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 121 8434: **l mean should I do it now.or later
14/08/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely your wish @263781218434, if you are available to proceed with the discussion you can share them now so that no delay will be done in the admission process.
14/08/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 121 8434: ...on the first video l can say that the the student is given more light on the importance of being given enrollment at Edoofa , through the vision , weakness and strengths of a child Edoofa helps one to achieve their dreams with affordable education ,also insuring that a child gets a job after University with the assistance of the Edoofa team .thus one should be a proud Edoofian  for the admission board gives admission to one who has a vision .and should explain why they want to pursue the career they have chosen .There are many Universities under the Edoofa program of which a student should be able to produce the statement of purpose which gives an insight of a child's vision ,also making sure that they do convince the admission board there that they are worthy of the scholarship at the University .On that the admission team is there to help through the process and during the whole admission process a student should be able to follow instructions towards the obtaining of the Acceptance Letter from the University while the Visa papers are being processed
14/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes still following
14/08/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Noted
14/08/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Wednesday at 01.00 pm.
14/08/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

16/08/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 121 8434: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents Triphine.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents and the academic interview answers may I know by when will you be able to fill the SOP form?
16/08/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 121 8434: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good evening .how are you?
16/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes that's right
16/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes am ready .
16/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Correct
16/08/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Okay noted
16/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes he did
16/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes it's understood
16/08/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
16/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
16/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Not any
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Noted ,thank you
16/08/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
17/08/23, 11:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: "Good morning Parents and Triphine.

22/09/23, 4:50 am - +263 78 121 8434: Not any for now
22/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good afternoon
22/09/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Triphine.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so we could not connect with you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes am available
22/09/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
22/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes I am
22/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
22/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
22/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
22/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Am done
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
22/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
22/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
22/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
22/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/09/23, 5:08 am - +263 78 121 8434: Following
25/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Triphine.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we were unavailable to connect with you, so we will be connecting tomorrow at 02.00 pm.
26/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning
26/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 78 121 8434: Noted
29/09/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning
30/09/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Triphine.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/10/23, 5:51 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning sorry yesterday was at school on that time .
04/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning
05/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Triphine.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence and not connecting with you, as I have been under the weather though I look forward to connecting with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 121 8434: good afternoon
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes am available
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
05/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes am clear
05/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
05/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
05/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: More information will do please
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Noted . thank you
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Right
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Noted
05/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
05/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
05/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Not any
05/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Triphine's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Triphine is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes please
05/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Question 1.: $1800 

Question 2: 5years 

Question 3 : $300 

Question 4:$750
14/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Triphine, regarding question number one, please take a look at the offer letter and answer it again dear.
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Ohh sorry it's $900
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
14/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
14/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
14/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
14/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following.
14/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
14/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
14/10/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
14/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes clear
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes.
14/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
14/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 121 8434: I stay in Marondera but Access to the ones in Harare is possible
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Okay thank you
14/10/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was going through your admission file and I noticed that you made the payment of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles via Mukuru. So, if you wish to use Mukuru for the payment of your registration fee, you can do that as well through the Mukuru Account of our associates in Africa. Now, while making the payment through Mukuru, you have two options, either you can do it via Mr. Charles for which the transfer charges will be 12.5% of the amount that you will be transferring, or you can do it through Mr. Rajan, for which the transfer charges would be 7% of the amount that you will be transferring. So, shall I share the Mukuru Account Details with you as well?
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes that would be great .and they will decide which is better for them to us
14/10/23, 3:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Here are the account details of Mr. Charles as well as Mr. Rajan, and based on the amount of transfer charges applicable on both modes, you can make the payment accordingly as per your preference.

16/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!

17/10/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand. On that note, shall we move ahead to continue with our discussion here now please?
19/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Triphine!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good evening
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Triphine!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes am ready
19/10/23, 7:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our discussion?
19/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Clear sir
19/10/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Following
19/10/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 121 8434: No queries sir
19/10/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 121 8434: They said the news about the University is good and also excited about it .... however they were not clear about how they were going to organize the payments for the University and would be able to pay the rest of the money by next year not within the 15 days period

25/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Okay I started that before my parents do farming thus as it is the rain season most of the income they get would be directed to the farm projects thus to raise the finances in full this year may be impossible
26/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
26/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, Triphine, I understand that your parents are finding it hard to raise the finances, however, I would also like to understand that since you were aware that your admission process is going to be completed in this year, how were you planning to raise the finances for the same?
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good afternoon

26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, by when shall I expect you to have a discussion with them and give me an update on the same?
26/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Tomorrow
27/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Good evening I am here to connect with you
28/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Our plan is that we get money in March 2024 so this day or date of 28th is too difficult for us to find money so ldont know what to do
30/10/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Thank you for sharing the same with me here. In that case, if you wish to wait till the coming year, to complete Triphine's admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons for that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 

2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case you might not get the same scholarship offers that you are getting now.
31/10/23, 5:37 am - +263 77 711 6432: Ok so this is a challenge to us so give us time to seat as afamily and find a way to find money
31/10/23, 5:46 am - +263 78 121 8434: Good morning sir
31/10/23, 5:49 am - +263 78 121 8434: ...so let's say l want to readmit next year ,do l really have to follow the same procedures again in the admission process that includes paying the $350 enrollment fee .How is it like .what will l have to do then
31/10/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 5:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if you wish to complete your admission in the coming year 2024, then, in that case, you won't have to pay the enrollment fee again, however, you would have to bear the loss of Endowment Plan Benefits that I have mentioned above, I hope this is clear?
01/11/23, 5:29 am - +263 77 711 6432: Morning lwant to ask is this a scholarship?
01/11/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get your question here well. Can you please clarify exactly what is it that you wish to know and the reason that you are unclear about the same?
06/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good afternoon
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
09/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Good afternoon
09/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good evening
14/11/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here. On that note, I would also like to mention that I had scheduled a specific time for us all to have a discussion here too, but even then, I did not get any response from your side and that is why I was concerned. If I may ask is everything alright?
15/11/23, 5:02 am - +263 77 711 6432: Good morning yes everything is alright except the school fees you talk about which we don't have at this time
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. however, on that note, we could have discussed that here, right?
17/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Right  now  sir we have decided  that  we look  for a university  place for Tryphine  next year when we have enough  money  for all the needed expenses  .henceforth  she won't  be able to proceed  for her education with or under edoofa  scholarship  program  since you said that  next year  she will  loose the endowments  if she chooses  to readmit  for 2024 intake .however  would  like to  ask if  we can get the enrollment  fee  paid back
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
17/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Good evening
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: How have you been doing for the past few days?
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Doing well and you ?
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm doing fine as well, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, since you had mentioned that you wish for Triphine to continue with the university education in the coming year, shall we disucss that now?
18/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Yes
20/11/23, 6:06 am - +263 77 711 6432: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Good evening ma'am shall we discuss now
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Triphine!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 711 6432: No we are not we will be ready to complete the admission next year
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, since you are planning to complete the admission process in the coming year, I believe you are aware that if you do that, then you might as well lose on the Endowment Plan Benefits that you will get now, right?
23/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 711 6432: We are waiting for results so why l you saying that she will lose that program becoz of not paying in this year the intake is for August 2024 so why so hurry
23/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe there is some sort of misunderstanding here. I am not trying to say that Triphine will lose on the program, but you won't get the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the $150 Grant that you can get if you plan to complete the admission process now.

I hope you understand?
23/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 711 6432: For instance what are some of the endowments benefits l will loose
23/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 711 6432: How so can one loose the endowments benefits by choosing to finish the admission process next year .what difference does it make from this year and next year
23/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Forward those 2 messeges
23/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Now, on that note may I know if you recall the Endowment Plan Benefits that were discussed with you earlier?
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for joining today's session. As my available hours are concluding, and it has been a long day, I'll be closing our session for now. Let's reconvene tomorrow starting from 01:00 PM to continue our discussion. Have a wonderful evening, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
24/11/23, 4:32 am - +263 77 711 6432: ,,,okay so you mean to say from the $600 that is to be paid now next year will have to pay $750 for the admission fee right .and is that the only she will loose or there is more sir ?
24/11/23, 4:32 am - +263 77 711 6432: Okay l understand on that note sir .but would also love to ask on the fact that you talked about an offer letter and admission later coming from the University itself to the child when does this happen ,,after paying or before paying the admission fee .?
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and TriphineI hope this message finds you well.

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Good afternoon yes
24/11/23, 7:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, when it comes to the first statement that you have shared here I would like to mention that once the registration fee if $600 would be paid now, then you won't have to pay anything till the time Triphine comes to India in 2024. This $600 itself is the registration fee with the $150 Grant that you have received.
24/11/23, 7:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Coming to the second statement, you have already received the offer letter here, and then once ther registration fee would be paid, then you will be getting the official admission acceptance letter from the side of the university. I hope this is clear?
24/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Okay sir l understand .but will be able to pay the $750 next year .after we have raised enough money
24/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 711 6432: Henceforth we will be able to finish the admission process next year
24/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I got that please. However, if you wish to do that, you would lose out on the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the $150 Grant, and I believe that it would only make it hard for you to deal with the admission process, right?
24/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 711 6432: If you can please do give a rundown of all that is included in the endowments benefits so that we can plan accordingly .could you highlight all the benefits on the endowments plan please
24/11/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, for that I would like you to go through the discussion that you had with Ms. Kirti here so that you can get to recall about the Endowment Plan Benefits please. 

Hence may you please go through them and then let me know once you are done.
