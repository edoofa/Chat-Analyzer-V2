24/05/23, 9:52 am - You were added
01/08/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/08/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier since I was occupied in the arrival of the students who just came to India.
01/08/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please it is true a huge batch of more than 70 students arrived yesterday here in India please.
01/08/23, 10:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to completing Mitchell's admission, can you please also let me know how is it that you are planning to raise the finances for the balance registration?
01/08/23, 10:51 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Oooh great my daughter is missing out
01/08/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 510 4173: I am still figuring this out Milan, given that she also needs visa funds and air ticket. That is the reason why I was proposing for her to get admitted nexr semester if this is possible
01/08/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Is the above possible Milan?
02/08/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Good evening
02/08/23, 11:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this, I do understand that you wish to shift her intake to the coming year, but before we do that, it would be better if we complete the registration as well, so that on the basis of the same, her seat for the 2024 intake can be secured. I hope you understand?
03/08/23, 7:34 am - +263 71 510 4173: Ok I understand. Now that it's for next year we now want to go for LPU given that it's a better school and we have a lot of time to prepare. Could you please also advise which month is the next intake so that we prepare well.
03/08/23, 7:38 am - +263 71 510 4173: Now the next question is,   given the above decision do we still have a deadline to pay the admission, if so by when? Please clarify thank you
05/08/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 510 4173: This message was deleted
05/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 510 4173: Good morning Milan

I think by September end my finances will be better so will pay by then. Is this ok with you?
08/08/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/08/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263715104173 By September end, it would be very late for completing the registration process since the university would already have started with the next year's intake. Therefore, we have to focus on completing the admission process in this month itself. I hope you are clear with that?
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Good afternoon, I understand
09/08/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/08/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, with regard to what I had mentioned yesterday, can you please let me know how are you preparing and planning to complete the admission process please?
09/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Good morning Milan, ok will update you
11/08/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/08/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263715104173 May I know if you have any update for me regarding your plans to move ahead with Mitchell's admission process as of now?
11/08/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Good afternoon Milan

Nothing as yet, will update as soon as possible, I am trying looking for the money
12/08/23, 11:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/08/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 799 0354: Good morning to you too
12/08/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: @263715104173 Yes, please I understand what you are trying to say, however, in that case you also have to understand that once we complete the admission process we do have the other steps as well to complete so that Mitchell can come to India and start with her studies. I hope you understand, right?
12/08/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 510 4173: Yes I understand
16/08/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/08/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier since I was not feeling well and had a high fever and yesterday, it was a national holiday on the occasion of Indian Independence Day! So, all of us were celebrating the joyous day. I appreciate your patience here.
16/08/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, @263715104173, regarding the same, can you please also let me know if you have had the chance to plan things out for clearing the balance by now?
16/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 510 4173: I am well thank you
16/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 510 4173: I am running around sir to raise the required money just bear with me as usual, thank you
16/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Things are very low here with the elections around the corner. Sorry for the inconvenience caused
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Ooooh congratulations for your independence
16/08/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, can you also help me in understanding about how much have you raise out of it?
16/08/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 510 4173: May I come back to you on this sir by end of next week
16/08/23, 5:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. But make sure to do that so that we can plan the next steps in Mitchell's admission journey. <This message was edited>
16/08/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Ok thank you
22/08/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Good afternoon Milan
22/08/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had earlier, may I know if you were able to plan about completing the registration process for Mitchell?
22/08/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 510 4173: May I please update by end of week like I said before
22/08/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 510 4173: But at it stand I see myself paying the remaining fees by September end because next week my other daughter who is still in high school is opening. I need to pay her fees as well. I think you understand me.

Milan could you please do your logistics so that I do this by September end  as per my earlier request. This will not strain my finances and I assure you this will be done come end of September.

I am sure you are able to do this
24/08/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/08/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that and I was able to understand what you are trying to say, however, for the August 2023 batch, the official admissions were closed on the 31st of July and ideally, Mitchell was supposed to complete her admission process before then. But due to the challenges you had, we have time and again sought an extension and have provided you with a payment plan as well. 

Now that we are already a month beyond the admission closure date, it is crucial for you to understand that if you miss the date of 31st August 2023, you will end up missing the August 2023 intake and Mitchell will have to lose one academic year, I am sure as a parent that is something you do not want for your child and considering that, we can help you by allowing you to clear the balance fee of Mitcell's fee before 311st August 2023 and allow Mitchell to plan her arrival in the month of September as you requested.

But I am afraid, I would not be in a position to allow you to make the payment in the month of September. I hope you are now clear with that, right?
24/08/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 510 4173: I understand your explanation, but if you refer to our previous conversations I have asked if it's possible that she get admitted the next intake, and you have said, 'yes', so I was planning towards the 2024 intake, in August i guess.

Is the above possible sir please advise
24/08/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 510 4173: If it's possible let's make it 2024 for her so that I have all the time to plan organise her fees and journey to India
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is true. However, for us to be able to even shift Mitchell's year of intake, it is important that we first secure the seat and for that to happen, it is required for us to complete the registration process first. I hope this is clear?
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 510 4173: So in this case may I pay up september end?
24/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Because obvious I won't make it because schools are a opening on the 3rd of september here, and I have to pay for this other one this monthend
24/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 510 4173: If I happen to fail by August end what will happen to Mitchell then?
28/08/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mitchell!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/08/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 510 4173: I am very well Milan and how are you
28/08/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well, thank you for asking. Now, when it comes to making the payment in September end, I have already informed you that it may lead to losing the scholarship seat for Mitchell please.
28/08/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Ok I understand
28/08/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good to know that you have understood. Hence, can you please let me know by when are you planning to clear the balance please?
28/08/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 510 4173: May I pay by the 11th of Sept please
