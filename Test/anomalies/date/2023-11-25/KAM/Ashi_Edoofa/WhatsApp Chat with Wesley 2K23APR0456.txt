06/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
06/09/23, 3:40 pm - +27 62 114 3321: You are welcome
06/09/23, 3:41 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes I do remember  the 6 steps

06/09/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
06/09/23, 5:49 pm - +27 62 114 3321: This message was deleted
06/09/23, 5:50 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Stage4 that's when the Edooda Admissions team sends my application  to multiple universities  for evaluation  and admission  process .That's when the offer letter is issued
06/09/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 5:54 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Waiting for exciting news 🤗
06/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Wesley, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 5:58 pm - +27 62 114 3321: It will be a great relief for  sure and much appreciated 👏
06/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
06/09/23, 6:00 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes
I would like to know more
06/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended.
06/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
06/09/23, 8:29 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay fine
Thank you
06/09/23, 8:30 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ooh okay
That sounds nice 
I wasn't aware of that
06/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
06/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.

For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:
06/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
06/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
06/09/23, 8:49 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Gone through
06/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
06/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
06/09/23, 9:09 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Very clear
Thank you
06/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes.
06/09/23, 9:27 pm - +27 62 114 3321: That's a great advantage of early decision. 
I love that part
06/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Very clear
Thank you👏
06/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/09/23, 9:58 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Meaning the deadline is not the final date of paying.
I did not get it nicely
06/09/23, 10:00 pm - +27 62 114 3321: I will be given extra 30days after deadline.
Am I right
06/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, dear.
06/09/23, 10:06 pm - +27 62 114 3321: All is clear
Thank you
06/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/09/23, 10:21 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Not aware of the process.
You may please provide with information on it
06/09/23, 10:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
07/09/23, 10:43 am - +27 62 114 3321: Thank you very much
07/09/23, 10:44 am - +27 62 114 3321: Goodmorning to you all
07/09/23, 1:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Wesley ,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
07/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 535 0406: Good afternoon ,l am ready
07/09/23, 2:03 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Good afternoon sir
07/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In continuation of our session.
07/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
07/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
07/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
07/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 535 0406: Okay thank you
07/09/23, 3:16 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Interesting part.
I like it
07/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 535 0406: Yes.
07/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
07/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 535 0406: Yes l agree with you.
07/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/09/23, 8:14 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Good evening to you 
It's okay
07/09/23, 8:15 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes it's clear
07/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2023, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2024, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2023 itself.
07/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
08/09/23, 7:53 am - +27 62 114 3321: It is very clear
Sorry for late response
08/09/23, 7:53 am - +27 62 114 3321: Goodmorning all
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 11:53 pm - +263 78 535 0406: Okay thank you so much ,
09/09/23, 9:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today?
09/09/23, 10:00 am - +27 62 114 3321: Greetings to you. 
We are doing well thanks, how are you?
09/09/23, 10:01 am - +27 62 114 3321: Im sorry Wesley is experiencing electricity challenges at school
09/09/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. Thank you for letting me know about the challenges. I am sure that Wesley will catch up to us. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
09/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 62 114 3321: We may proceed he catch up once he got power
09/09/23, 10:11 am - +27 62 114 3321: He will catch up
09/09/23, 10:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 10:13 am - +27 62 114 3321: Okay
09/09/23, 10:13 am - +27 62 114 3321: That's clear
09/09/23, 10:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 10:24 am - +27 62 114 3321: They are all clear
Thank you
09/09/23, 10:24 am - +27 62 114 3321: We can proceed
09/09/23, 10:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 10:29 am - +27 62 114 3321: Will definitely do that.

11/09/23, 7:53 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Good evening to you.
We are doing well thanks and how are you
11/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 535 0406: I am doing okay ,thank you .How are you??
11/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am great, thank you so much for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 8:27 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes we can proceed
11/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Wesley, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
12/09/23, 8:15 am - +27 62 114 3321: Goodmorning  morning. 
I get  hold of Wesley last night,he said he followed all the conversation and understood everything so his school schedule is tight since he is starting exams next month
12/09/23, 8:16 am - +27 62 114 3321: If it's okay to proceed with me then he will catch up
12/09/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Wesley.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Thank you for letting me know, it is indeed alright to proceed with the session with the parents or guardians.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Good afternoon 
Sorry for being late  for the session.
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - +27 62 114 3321: We can proceed
12/09/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 114 3321: As for now no queries
Thank you
12/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
12/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 2:48 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes 
We are on the same page
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 62 114 3321: You can go ahead with the university admission process.
We are mentally and financially prepared for that
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 4:07 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Very clear
Thanks
12/09/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 8:03 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes please
12/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 8:17 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes it's clear
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 15th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 8:46 pm - +27 62 114 3321: We are on the same page
12/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 9:01 pm - +27 62 114 3321: They are clear
12/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 9:06 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Our admission process about to start now
12/09/23, 9:09 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Once I receive the offer letter from the University within 3 to 4 working days
Then I hv to pay the registration fee
12/09/23, 9:11 pm - +27 62 114 3321: 150 paid by Edoofa
300 to be paid within 15days of when I get offer letter then the other 300 to be paid within a month from the deadline of the first payment
12/09/23, 9:13 pm - +27 62 114 3321: That is if I go for Early Registration
12/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 9:17 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes it's clear
12/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
12/09/23, 9:23 pm - +27 62 114 3321: I want to avail for the Early Decision  Benefit please
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - +27 62 114 3321: You can go ahead sharing the application with the universities.
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Thank you
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by *1st October* and *1st November* and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
12/09/23, 9:48 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Sure
12/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Wesley’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Wesley’s higher education well.
12/09/23, 9:53 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay
Thank you very much
12/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Name. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 9:55 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay that's fine
12/09/23, 9:56 pm - +27 62 114 3321: So how do we know which university to choose
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For that after the arrival of the multiple offer letters you will be able to choose from them.
12/09/23, 9:59 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay
Looking forward...
Thank you
20/09/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wesley!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 12:17 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Goodmorning mr Milan
We are doing well 
How are you doing?
20/09/23, 12:19 pm - +27 62 114 3321: We are so much excited about this opportunity  and the prestigious offer from Galgotias University 💃💃🤗🥳
20/09/23, 12:20 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Will go through the letter and come back
Thank you
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well please, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, once you are done going through the offer letter, please let me know so that we can move aehad to discuss about the same.
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Gone through 
We can move ahead
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:17 pm - +27 62 114 3321: 1..900
2...4yrs or 8semesters
3...300
4...750
20/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:22 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - +27 62 114 3321: That will be much better
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ok
For that time you will be staying where.
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the time being, the students can stay at nearby off-campus accommodations and they can simultaneously check which one is better for them. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - +27 62 114 3321: It is clear
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes it's clear
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes
Harare
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ok thanks
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +27 62 114 3321: So if I give him cash,how will I get the receipts
To show that I have paid
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you would have made the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will then give you an official receipt with Edoofa's stamp on that, and you can then use that receipt for the verification of the payment by sharing it here. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ooh okay
That's clear
20/09/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +27 62 114 3321: No I will now opt for 7% 
Mr Rajan
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Also there is part written,submit A level results before registration.
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - +27 62 114 3321: We only get the results in February nxt year
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure you can do that as well, however, if you consider to make the payment to Mr. Charles later due to any reason, you can then keep a note of his details. Let me share the same with you here. 

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/09/23, 2:04 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ok thank you.

Also am I allowed  incase I get someone with cheaper percentages
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well dear, can you please come again?
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Here
20/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, when it comes to submitting your A-Level Results to be submitted before your registration, it means that you would have to submit them before arriving here in India and registering yourself at the university campus. And since it would happen in coming year 2024, there won't be an issue on that, I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ooh okay
It's clear now
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 2:13 pm - +27 62 114 3321: That's clear
Thank you
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Very clear
Thank you
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +27 62 114 3321: I'm proud to be an Edoofian 🤗
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Everything  is clear 
Thank you.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 2:32 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Thank you
20/09/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/09/23, 2:39 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay I will
Thank you
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! Have a good day ahead!
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Same to you
Thank you
22/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wesley!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
22/09/23, 1:50 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Good Afternoon  Mr Milan.
We are doing well thanks n you?
22/09/23, 1:54 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes we managed to discuss   regarding the offer letter from Galgoias University and we are still deciding what to do because it seems the fees n accommodation is more than what we were expecting.
22/09/23, 1:57 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Besides re-evaluation of the application from the University when results are out,is there any other chance of getting more than  50% of scholarship.
22/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here and it is completely fine to be worried about the same since getting an opportunity for international education is not a small thing. Now, coming to your first query, being your admission officer, I would suggest that you should secure the admission seat for now to ensure that Wesley doe not lose on any offer, and moving ahead, when the other offer letters would arrive, you can then always transfer his admission to another university. 

In that way, you won't lose out on any opportunity and will always have the option to choose.
22/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, coming to your second query, yes, there are certain partner universities of ours that provide the students with a higher quantum of scholarships so that the costs can be brought down. Stay assured that we have shared Wesley's application with those universities as well and once we will receive a response from their side, we will let you know. I hope this is understood?
22/09/23, 2:12 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Ok I understand
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Okay thanks
So let's say I secure the admission seat with Galgoias University,will it be possible  to move to another university incase I got the one with a higher quantum of scholarship
22/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely! In that case, the registration fee that you will pay for your admission at Galgotias University will be adjusted towards your admission at the other university depending on your preference. I hope this is clear?
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +27 62 114 3321: It is clear
Thank you
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
22/09/23, 2:22 pm - +27 62 114 3321: As for now everything  is clear
Thank you
22/09/23, 2:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good! Now, It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
22/09/23, 2:30 pm - +27 62 114 3321: It well and we were both excited about getting an offer to study abroad though we were bit worried again about our financial status compared to the fees needed
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that you have been working hard to ensure that Wesley's career is on the right path and that you're well-prepared to support Wesley. 

Now, when it comes to the concern that you had shared here I understand that the costs might seem to be a burden at first, however, being the admission officer here, I would highly advise you to focus on securing the seat rather than the finances, because once the seat would be reserved then you can always transfer the admission from one university to another please. I hope this is understood, right?
22/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes
Thank you very much
22/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +27 62 114 3321: No questions yet
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Yes we did
22/09/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
22/09/23, 2:56 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Two parts of 300 as per the shared due dates
22/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today. It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?
22/09/23, 4:02 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Will pay the 1st 300 on the 30th of September
22/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. I will update the university officials as well. We are done with our sessions for now and since you now have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
						
After making the payment, kindly send us the receipt so that we can confirm it with the accounts team and inform the university officials. Don't hesitate to contact us if you require any assistance.
22/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: That being said, we will end our conversation for today. Have a wonderful day and please convey our greetings to your family as well!
22/09/23, 4:16 pm - +27 62 114 3321: I will do that
Thank you very much
22/09/23, 4:17 pm - +27 62 114 3321: Have a wonderful day too
