10/10/23, 5:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Rumbidzai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Rumbidzai's higher education?
10/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Greetings Ms Kirti and all the team members. We are doing great, thanks. Can we discuss in an hour's time from now. M on the road, might have network challenges in some places. Sorry for any inconveniences this might cause.
10/10/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate the heads-up about potential network challenges while you're on the road. Taking such precautions is understandable, and it's not inconvenient at all. Let us reconnect today at 08:00 pm.
10/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted, thank you.
10/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Greetings once again. I am Rumbidzai's father. Currently she is at school writing her examinations untill the 10th of November. Unfortunately the school does not allow them to take phones to school therefore she won't be taking part in this discussion.

We have been making some preparations for Rumbidzai's tertiary education in many aspects. We have been encouraging her to work hard in preparation for her examinations and providing all the necessary resources for her to be psychologically ready for the examinations. We have have also been saving some financial resources in preparation for her enrollment for her education. In summary these are some of the preparations we have done. Thank you.
10/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's wonderful to hear about the preparations you've been making for Rumbidzai's tertiary education. Encouraging her to work hard and providing the necessary resources and support for her exams is essential for her success. Saving financial resources for her education is a wise step as well.
10/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that she cannot participate in the current discussion due to school regulations, but that's perfectly fine and that is why this group wants parents to be equally involved in the discussions. It is completely alright for you to continue with the discussion on behalf of the student, I am sure she will catch up to the conversation when she is available. So may I know if you are comfortable now to proceed with the discussion ahead?
10/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I am comfortable to proceed with the discussion.
10/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 300 3401: It's quite inspirational to know how you endeavor to shape the future of these youngsters. Indeed they must embrace this opportunity.
10/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you very much for your kind words. It's truly inspiring to assist these motivated and talented young individuals like your child. We believe in the power of education and are committed to helping students achieve their dreams and shape their futures. I hope you are excited to see Rumbidzai in this picture for next year?
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Oh yes, I am looking forward to that. We will all be excited for her.
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Design (Fashion) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
10/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes it is correct
10/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I will be able to share with you her O-level results and bithcertificate. The documents on item 1. Are not available with me here. The statement of entry is used during her examinations.
10/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I am aware of that fact @263773003401 in that case, may I know if you could connect with the school and ask for Rumbidzai's statement of entry for A-level?
10/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I can get the statement of entry on Friday.
10/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges since Friday is a long time?
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I can not travell to her school due to work commitments. I can only get time on Friday afternoon.
10/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I understand that, in that case, may I suggest you connect with the school teacher over call and ask them to share the picture of the Statement of entry with you and you can share the same picture with us?
10/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Will make an effort to do that tomorrow.
10/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available have a blessed night.
10/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 300 3401: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 300 3401: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us.
10/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Thank you, tomorrow will make all effort to get the statement of entry
10/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.

10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, we have taken a note of it.
10/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Is it all for today
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you, it was lovely connecting with you. Have a blessed night.
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Same to you Kirti, thanks
11/10/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 300 3401: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning Kirti, I have forwarded the statement of entry for Rumbidzai above
11/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai.

I hope you are doing well and thank you for sharing the statement of entry, it is duly noted with us. With regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Good afternoon Kirti, yes we can connect
11/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Thank you for sending the cycle, some steps, couldn't remember all off head.
11/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help you recall the steps. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
11/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you have any questions please feel free to ask?
11/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Well explained, thank you.
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
11/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Thank you we can proceed.
11/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I understand that the student will then have to choose one university.
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Will you provide the details on the universities and programs so that we make inform decisions
11/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, we will assist you throughout to choose the right university according to your and Rumbidzai's preference, please.
11/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted, thank you
11/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750.* Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Correct
11/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just *$2700 to $3700 per year*. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Well understood, thanks
11/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Well understood, thanks
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Understood, thank you.
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I am following, thanks
11/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I would want further clarification on timeframes from the application process up untill the payment of the registration fee. This will help us to plan.
11/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, @263773003401 as we move ahead with our discussion your queries will be answered step by step. May I know if you are ready to move ahead?
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes please let's move ahead, thanks
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I appreciate for the well articulated discussion.
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have gone through them, however I need some clarification, do you or the universities have minimum grades or points that they require for admissions. As an example, here in Zimbabwe some universities specify the minimum entry points or passes prospective students should have, like 15 points(straight As) for program like medicine.
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I understand your concern and every university has a eligibility criteria, as we will discuss the points in detail you shall understand better, so may I know if you are ready to start?
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes please let's proceed
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Rumbidzai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Wonderful, quite interesting.
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes it does resonate with me quite well, thanks.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I am clear, thanks
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted, thank you.
11/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have understood your explanations, so far I don't have any questions.
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As her guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I am very much excited and do all what is expected of me as the guardian to ensure she is part of the Edooofa scholarship program.
11/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am really happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Thank you for the insightful conversation.
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a blessed day ahead!
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rumbidzai.

14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for tomorrow at 11.30 AM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey.

14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 300 3401: Dear Milan. Thank you very much for the hard work you are doing to get Rumbidzai a place and scholarship. We are very thankful for that.
14/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 300 3401: Meanwhile we will be going through the offer letter and will discuss further.
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good afternoon Milan. We are doing well, thanks. Yes I have managed to go through the offer letter and I am available for further discussion
15/10/23, 11:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 300 3401: 1. $900
2. 4 years(8 semesters)
3. $300
4. $750
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Clear
15/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Hi Milan, you have gone quiet.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning Milan, my apologies as well. I went to bed early yesterday. We can proceed with our discussion at any time  convinient to you. Thank you
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rumbidzai!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 300 3401: Yes m clear, thanks
16/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 300 3401: Yes we are together
16/10/23, 12:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I am clear, let's move on
16/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I stay in Gweru.
16/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I would opt to pay in two instalments.
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Ok thank you. I will talk to him.
16/10/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes please share so that I can weigh a cheaper and convinient option
16/10/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Hi Milan is the examination fee payable now, I might have missed the deadline for this payment.
16/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I will opt paying through Mr Jerera. It's less costly than travelling to Harare
16/10/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please. The exam fee will be required when Rumbidzai will arrive here in India. For now, you would only have to pay the registration fee please. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes I am clear.
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Understood, thanks
16/10/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 300 3401: How can I get an insight into the curriculum of the program at Galgotias University. Just to have a glimpse of what Rumbidzai will be covering, coarse synopsis. My hope is after college, she must be an entrepreneur.
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Yes very clear, thanks
16/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Hi Milan, I am almost about to leave my workplace. Can we schedule our discussion for tomorrow. Will get home around 7 in the evening.
17/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, we will arrange the same for you please. I hope that is okay with you right. Moving ahead, shall we proceed with our conversation now?
17/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Good afternoon Milan, let's proceed with our discussion
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Well understood, it's clear
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have understood all we have discussed, please go ahead and share
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 300 3401: One question on payment of the registration fee. As you are aware, we have chosen to split the payment into two instalments, one next week, then end of November, has this been confirmed with you.
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, this has been confirmed with the payment plan that we had discussed earlier. If I may ask do you wish to add anything to that?

19/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600.
