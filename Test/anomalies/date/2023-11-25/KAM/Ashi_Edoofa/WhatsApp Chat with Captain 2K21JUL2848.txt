04/08/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To begin our discussion, we wanted to inquire about the status of your visa application process. Have you been able to collect your visa from the embassy?

08/08/23, 7:37 am - +27 62 289 0833: Sorry for late response.

As I said before things were going on well but because of the challenges at home. There was a crisis which rose and it didn't end well and they were out of budget.
11/08/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Captain, 

I hope you are doing well. Following our recent conversation, we want to know about the challenges you've been facing. We truly admire your courage in sharing your concerns. We understand how tough this situation is, especially when you have an excellent scholarship for your education abroad.

11/08/23, 2:48 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Thank you Edoofa.
I will be available Today from 6pm Zimbabwean time
11/08/23, 3:04 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Or tomorrow the same time, if today isn't successful
11/08/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted @27622890833, We'll waiting for you
11/08/23, 6:16 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Hello
12/08/23, 8:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing good. Let's have a discussion today
12/08/23, 8:37 am - +27 62 289 0833: Okay, thank you
12/08/23, 8:38 am - +27 62 289 0833: Noted
12/08/23, 9:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Firstly, We want to express our gratitude for taking the time to reconnect with us. We have gone through the previous message you have shared with us. If you don't mind, could you kindly elaborate on which specific aspect of the education cost presents a temporary challenge for you? This insight would help us to better understand your decision to consider deferring your admission.
12/08/23, 9:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: We deeply understand the financial challenges that can arise unexpectedly. We empathize with your situation and the difficult decision that was made to temporarily postpone Captain's education due to unforeseen circumstances with the release of funds for university fees.
12/08/23, 9:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Considering your current circumstances, we want to assure you that we are here to support you in the best possible way and we will work together to find the most suitable solution.
12/08/23, 10:42 am - +27 62 289 0833: Okay thank you
12/08/23, 10:44 am - +27 62 289 0833: What happened is that I was going to be coming to India by the end of July but something came up at the beginning of July and we got out of budget and they promised to cover it up before the deadline but things didn't go as planned and it ended up not successful.
12/08/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely, your proactive approach is commendable. We are with you in this tough situation. At this point, the remaining steps involve initiating your visa application, securing your flight ticket, and getting ready for his journey to India. Once he arrives, the focus will shift to getting everything in order for his first semester's fees.
12/08/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To move forward, could you kindly let us know the current amount you've managed to set aside for Captain's higher education if you were to plan for him to join soon ? Having this information will enable me to assist you in planning the next steps effectively and ensuring a smooth transition.
12/08/23, 12:37 pm - +27 62 289 0833: There is 700USD now and calculating the amount that civil engineering requires it's 1200USD and with the other costs it cannot match up as of now.
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan, Senior admissions officer here at Edoofa. I was going through the discussion that you were having with Ms. Ashi and I came to notice that you were facing some financial challenges due to which you were planning to pull out from this year's intake and then come in the next year. Hence, I wanted to have a discussion with you regarding the same, so, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same?
24/08/23, 3:17 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Okay
24/08/23, 3:18 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Is it possible to have a discussion today at 7:30pm CAT

28/08/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, can you please first help me in understanding about the main challenges that you are facing in moving ahead with your higher education and to arrive here in India?
28/08/23, 1:18 pm - +27 62 289 0833: As I said before things were going on well but because of the challenges at home. There was a crisis which rose and it didn't end well and they were out of budget.
28/08/23, 1:25 pm - +27 62 289 0833: I faced a financial challenge
31/08/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/08/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Captain, I completely understood about the fact that due to certain challenges at home, you were not able to move ahead with your admission journey. Now, I wanted to understand more about the exact issues that you faced which led you to this situation, so that we can discuss and plan the way ahead accordingly.
31/08/23, 9:01 am - +27 62 289 0833: What happened is this

From my father's children, I wasn't the only one going to school but we are 2 who were supposed to go to school this year and another one is from another mother.
So my father was saving for us two. And my father has a shop which he was building at that time and so he took some of the money and invested it in finishing the shop, assuming that he was going to cover it up from his business and it didn't go as planned and one of us was supposed to go to school and they suggested that she must go to school and I can go next year since I am going to university and she was going to a boarding school.
31/08/23, 1:07 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes
02/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, can you please also help me in understanding that how is it you are planning to raise the finances for your higher education in the coming year?
02/09/23, 6:36 pm - +27 62 289 0833: We are saving at least 150 USD per month and more than if the sales are better in the business
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing you thoughts on that here. Now, can you please also help me in understanding that by when do you think you would be able to raise the required amount for you to arrive here in India and start with your studies?
05/09/23, 10:18 am - +27 62 289 0833: By the end of April next year it will be organised for the whole year
05/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, Captain, I had a discussion with the academic board about the same and we do have another solution for you to navigate this situation in a better way, shall we discuss that now?
05/09/23, 2:07 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes of course
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier, since I was occupied in coordinating the arrival of the recent batch of Edoofians who came to India yesterday. I appreciate your patience here. Let me share a glimpse from the airport with you here as well.
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Captain, as per the discussion that I had with the academic board, the better option for you to navigate your higher education at LPU is to pay the first-semester fee and then take a term off and then come in the month of January. How does this option sound to you?
07/09/23, 2:12 pm - +27 62 289 0833: I think it will be the best one.
07/09/23, 2:12 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Let me check with my parents now and I will inform you as soon as possible
07/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please do that and then let me know dear.
07/09/23, 4:33 pm - +27 62 289 0833: It's okay 😇
I am going to do that immediately.
It's good news indeed, thank you👏
11/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please as soon as you know about the same, please let me know.
11/09/23, 8:11 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Good day to you
11/09/23, 8:12 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Sorry for late response, I was unavailable
11/09/23, 8:13 pm - +27 62 289 0833: As per the discussion with my parents,  they rejected it saying they are not sure if they will make it for January
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, on that note, can you please also help me in understanding about why is that your parents have denied that you should join the January intake?
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +27 62 289 0833: They have been doing some renovations at our old supermarket recently and also starting a new business,  so they said they are not sure if they are going to make it before January.
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +27 62 289 0833: They want me to go to school but they said with the current situation,  they can't predict accurately as to whether they will make it and I will be going to school this early because they thought that since I failed to go to school this year I will be going next year same month since there is no early intake and they started doing some other plans.
12/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. In that case, did you not manage to have a conversation with them about the same and discuss if they would be able to plan the finances for the January intake?
12/09/23, 5:55 pm - +27 62 289 0833: I am still in talk with them
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Captain!
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion here. May I know by when can we connect with each other for proceeding with that?
19/09/23, 4:57 am - +27 62 289 0833: Good morning
19/09/23, 5:00 am - +27 62 289 0833: My apologies for not responding in time, I thought I had told you. 
We can connect today at 12pm CAT
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Captain, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now dear?
19/09/23, 3:30 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes we can
19/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Captain, may I know if you were able to have a discussion with your parents about the same by now?
19/09/23, 4:09 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes I did
19/09/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. On that note, can you please also let me know what were their thoughts on the January Intake?
19/09/23, 4:19 pm - +27 62 289 0833: They said they will try to make sure that I make it by January
19/09/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. In that case, may I know if you were able to discuss with them about the first semester fee that you have to pay as well?
19/09/23, 4:24 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Oh I forgot, but may I know when I am supposed to pay it so I can discuss all the details with them
19/09/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Captain, if you wish to take the term off, you would have to pay the fee in this month or maximum by October first week to secure your seat for the term off please.
19/09/23, 4:27 pm - +27 62 289 0833: OKAY thank you,  I will get back to you soon
19/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when shall I expect your response on that?
19/09/23, 4:29 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Tomorrow evening
19/09/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear. Have a good day ahead.

21/09/23, 6:58 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Good evening sir.
21/09/23, 7:24 pm - +27 62 289 0833: I have talked with my parents and they have said that because of the time left and the money needed seems a bit too much for them to gather in such a short time left. 
They also want to know what will happen to my first term studies of which I am not there now, am I going to be continuing as if I was there or I will be going to start anew.
23/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, when it comes to continuing with your first semester, you would be doing that along with your second semester studies dear. In that way completing the whole first year by August 2024 and not losing any valuable time. 

Moving ahead, can you please also let me know by when would your parents be comfortable in raising the first semester fee that is required for getting the term off for you?
24/09/23, 3:32 pm - +27 62 289 0833: By the middle of next month.
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the same. Now, on that note, I would share the same information with the university offiicials and we will then confirm your term off for the term of August 2023 - January 2024. 

For, now, you can move ahead to start your preparations to raise the finances for paying you first semester fee so that we can confirm your term off in the coming days.
26/09/23, 11:51 am - +27 62 289 0833: Okay no problem
17/10/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Captain!

19/10/23, 5:28 am - +27 62 289 0833: Am sorry for late response, I was unavailable.

Let's connect today at 1pm Zimbabwean time.
19/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well.
19/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse for not attending your message earlier, May I know if you are available for the discussion now?
19/10/23, 3:39 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Hello

20/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well. 

May I know if we can schedule our session for tomorrow at 12:00pm CAT?
20/10/23, 4:20 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes it's alright.
20/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, Looking forward for our session.
20/10/23, 4:39 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Sure 😊
21/10/23, 12:15 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Hello
21/10/23, 12:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well. 

Let's start our session for today, I hope you are excited for the same.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Oh yes
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Sorry for the late response, I was busy a little
21/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @27622890833, However May I know if you are available now for the session?
21/10/23, 1:10 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yeah 👍
21/10/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now as you are aware, each year, there is only one academic intake, which is scheduled for the month of August. As a student, you have the option to join either the August 2023 intake or the August 2024 intake. Given that you needed some additional time to prepare for your arrival in India, you were not in a position to join the August 2023. However, you also do not want to wait until the August 2024 intake.
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In such a scenario, there is a provision that allows students to enroll in the August 2023 batch and take a term off for the first semester, spanning from August to December. Following this term off, you will arrive in India in January 2024 and commence your second semester
21/10/23, 1:18 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Okay 👍
21/10/23, 1:18 pm - +27 62 289 0833: That seems interesting
21/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @27622890833. Let us also get into the term off, which is essentially a structured break during the academic year. This period coincides with the summer vacation and offers you a unique opportunity. 

During the term off, you will focus on catching up with the material from Semester 1. The primary aim here is to ensure that you are in sync with your fellow students and won't fall behind in your studies. Typically, term off classes are scheduled from May to July.
21/10/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After this dedicated period of study during the summer vacation, you will be well-prepared to resume your regular academic schedule. You will seamlessly transition into Semester 3, continuing your education alongside the classmates who initially started their studies in August 2023.

This approach allows you to strike a balance between your academic progress and the need for additional preparation time, making sure you're fully equipped to excel in your degree program. I hope this gives you a bit more insight?
21/10/23, 1:21 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yesh I understand
21/10/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we are in sync. Now, let's also get into how a student manages his/her tuition fees during term-offs. As you are already aware, your tuition fee per semester stands at $1225. Given that you will be covering two semesters (Semester 1 and Semester 2) during your term off, the total tuition fee due for your first year will amount to $2450.
21/10/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to the tuition fees, there are a couple of essential charges to consider. The per annum examination fee comes to $150, and the health insurance fee amounts to $50. When you combine these fees, the total amount payable to the university for your first year of education totals $2650.
21/10/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I trust that we are in agreement with this breakdown of fees?
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Yes we are altogether
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you have a clear understanding of the term off procedures. Now, let's discuss the payment of the fees. The total fee of $2650 that we just discussed does not need to be paid all at once.
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you have already paid a registration fee of $700, this amount will be adjusted against your total fees. Therefore, the remaining balance is $1950, which can be conveniently disbursed throughout the year according to the following schedule:

1. $650 in the month of October 2023.
2. $650 in the month of January 2024.
3. $650 in the month of April 2024.
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan allows you to spread out the financial commitment over several months, making it more manageable and accommodating your financial needs. I hope you are clear with this as well?
21/10/23, 1:29 pm - +27 62 289 0833: This is great 👍
21/10/23, 1:29 pm - +27 62 289 0833: It's good for me
21/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @27622890833. Now, I would like to propose that you should take some time to engage in a thoughtful discussion with my family regarding the matters we've discussed today. Following our conversation, I suggest we will reconnect on Monday  at 12:00pm to continue our discussion.
21/10/23, 1:32 pm - +27 62 289 0833: That's great news for Today
21/10/23, 1:32 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Thank you
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27622890833
23/10/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you had a great Weekend. 

In reference to our discussion on Saturday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
25/10/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well.

Now, it is important for you to start with the formalities of the admission. Hence, it's essential to inform the academic board about your decision. You can do this by sending an email to *academicboard@edoofa.com*. This helps us ensure that your academic records are updated correctly.

I hope you are clear about what taking a term off means and how it can be a beneficial option for students who need to catch up on their coursework.

With respect to your concern, I can understand that you are currently experiencing some challenges, and I genuinely appreciate your transparency in sharing this with us. To offer the most effective assistance, I kindly request you to share the challenges you are encountering. Your insights will enable us to provide you with the support and guidance you may require. Please feel free to elaborate on the nature of these challenges so that we can work
03/11/23, 7:18 pm - +27 62 289 0833: The first is that I am not staying with my parents so far and I am just communicating with them through the phone and my mother and father stay in different places also. My mother is in Masvingo and my father is in Beitbridge and he stays with another wife there in Beitbridge. 
My parents are promising me that it will be okay soon but then they get occupied with something and fail to keep their promise.
06/11/23, 5:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Captain,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly follow up on our previous communication concerning the payment of the first installment. We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide an update on the status of this payment.
07/11/23, 6:58 am - +27 62 289 0833: Good morning sir 🙏
Can you please give me time until tomorrow morning.

07/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27622890833
09/11/23, 9:47 am - +27 62 289 0833: Good morning sir.
I did speak with my parents regarding the decision of starting my career in January and they are now saying, what if I just pay the money in January when I come.i mean  the whole amount of first semester and second semester because now they are busy with the renovations and other things at our house and shop.
09/11/23, 11:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response with us @27622890833, I can genuinely empathize with the challenges and busy schedules your parents are currently facing, especially with the ongoing renovation work.

I appreciate your concern regarding the payment schedule for the first and second semesters, particularly the desire to pay the whole amount in January. It's imperative to emphasize the importance of making the first installment this month. As you're likely aware, the 2023 academic session commenced back in August, in order to reserve your scholarship seat in the University it's necessary to complete this payment.
09/11/23, 11:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: However, I fully understand that the circumstances you are facing, and I'm eager to work with you to find a solution that accommodates your financial situation. To assist us in this endeavor, I kindly request an update on the progress you've made in raising the necessary fees. Your transparency in this matter will be immensely valuable as we explore the best way forward.
09/11/23, 6:13 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Okay okay thank you
09/11/23, 6:14 pm - +27 62 289 0833: I will pass on the message and will give you the update either this evening or tomorrow morning
09/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27622890833, We will be waiting for an update from your end
13/11/23, 11:25 am - +27 62 289 0833: Morning sir.

I tried to talk to my parents and tried convincing them about it but to no avail. 
If possible just cancel it.
Am sorry for the delay
15/11/23, 11:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Captain, I hope you are doing well. 

Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past couple of days, we were celebrating a major Indian festival - "Festival of Lights" which is also known as Diwali. 

It is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends
15/11/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. I am sure once you are in India, you will be able to celebrate this happy festival with us and experience all of these emotions. 

On this note, I would like to connect with you today and have a session regarding your journey, Could you please let me know when can we connect dear?
15/11/23, 7:51 pm - +27 62 289 0833: Tomorrow by 2pm CAT
