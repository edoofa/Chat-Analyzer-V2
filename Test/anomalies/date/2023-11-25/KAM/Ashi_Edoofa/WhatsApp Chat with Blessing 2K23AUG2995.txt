15/09/23, 8:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Name. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other,  I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
15/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thanks Vilsa for your interest in knowing your student better, but unfortunately, the student/beneficiary is currently at school where there are restricted from using their phones or laptops for anything else other than school, such that she is not able to communicate with you until the 15th of November 2023. Currently, you are chatting her father. So I will be able to answer questions directed to parents. Sorry for the inconveniences this may cause.
15/09/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely understandable, @263774931133, and I can appreciate that some schools restrict students from using their phones or other electronic gadgets to help them focus on their academics. Marian High School strongly believes in this approach, and therefore, we are patiently waiting for her and are indeed looking forward to connecting with Blessing once she is back home after her exams. Until then, we wish her all the best of luck.

At the same time, I am also glad to see that you are able to connect with us on your daughter's behalf. This ensures that she stays on track in her academic journey. If I am correct, I believe I am interacting with Mr. Tinomutendashe, the father of our proud Edoofian, and you are the one who will play a significant role in shaping Blessing's education and career?
15/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Absolutely yes
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation Mr. Tinomutendashe! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. 

The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you as guardians or the student won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
15/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted. I do shift work at my workplace such that at times I will be available during the day ie from 0900hrs CAT to around 1700hrs CAT, and some times I will be available from 1900hrs CAT until the following day in the morning.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring she has access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.
15/09/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with Blessing's counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

19/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
19/09/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, Mr. Tinomutendashe. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Done
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
19/09/23, 8:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/09/23, 8:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/09/23, 8:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/09/23, 8:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you are following these two steps as well?
19/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
19/09/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/09/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/09/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/09/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Clear
19/09/23, 8:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, @263774931133. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps and if we are on the same page and both available for further discussion, shall we begin with the first step of the admission journey, which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
19/09/23, 8:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright @263774931133. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/09/23, 8:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

19/09/23, 9:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 07:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the four videos and share your understanding. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
19/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Same to you, thank you
20/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good evening Vilsha. I am online now. We may proceed with today's session.
20/09/23, 8:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
20/09/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure Blessing is on the right path in her educational journey?
20/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Ok.
20/09/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Video 1: The video talks about following instructions and that students should be teachable and open minded.
20/09/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
20/09/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Video 2: Talks about Edoofa's vision which is focused on increasing the student's capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent.
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Yes, that is correct, Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Video 3: Students should understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time (over 10 years) to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians, therefore Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to be prepared and be qualified for these prestigious institutions.
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

Correct @263774931133, In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to students' career goals.
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Video 4: Its about the Statement of Purpose which is an important document, students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form.
20/09/23, 8:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

Rightly said Mr. Tinomutendashe. The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/09/23, 8:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 493 1133: True
20/09/23, 8:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, Mr. Tinomutendashe, with the videos, we have successfully completed the first step of Blessing's university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office). Therefore, we will now progress to the second step in her admission journey, which is the statement of purpose.

For this phase, we would require Blessing's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf. Consequently, I would like to inquire if it would be possible for Blessing to complete this activity over the weekend?
20/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I will have to request for permission from the school authorities to collect her over the weekend. I will come back to you on Friday 22 September 2023.
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, that would be absolutely fine @263774931133. It s our responsibility to move Blessing's application ahead and help her to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. 

So, for the team to work on her application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, She will have to take her time and try to complete these takes before Monday. (Considering that she is not allowed to use her phone).
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. Since you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in a student's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. Blessing will have to fill it out carefully. After she submits the form, you will get a message that her response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/09/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. I am also sharing two documents with you. Kindly ask Blessing to go through both documents and submit her responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure she researches well before starting the task.

20/09/23, 8:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
20/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I think there is an error on the chosen field of study. Blessing applied for the Bachelor in Business Administration not Law.
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for correcting me @263774931133, let me reshare the document in accordance with the course Blessing has chosen -

20/09/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263774931133. I believe by Friday you will be able to share an update for all these with me and hence we will be able to move forward with our discussions accordingly?
20/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I hope so.
20/09/23, 8:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, that would be absolutely fine. In that case, @263774931133, may I know if you would like to continue with our discussion for now and move forward to the next stages or if you wish to wait to consult with Blessing about these tasks and then plan the way further?
20/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Let me consult wit Blessing first so that we may plan accordingly.
20/09/23, 9:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay, Mr. Tinomutendashe, that sounds good. In that case, we will conclude the conversation for now. Tomorrow, for a brief window, I will connect with you during the day to assist you in commencing Blessing's EWYL journey.

We will then reconnect on Friday evening for our next session. I hope that by then, you will have been able to connect with Blessing. If you have any queries or concerns before then, please feel free to share them here in your admission group.

Wishing you a blessed night, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
20/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Same to you, thanks.
21/09/23, 9:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

In light of our discussion and the promise made to you yesterday, I would like to assist you in getting started with Blessing's EWYL Journey. Based on her EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence her EWYL journey on Friday (22nd September 2023).

To kickstart the process, Blessing's dedicated EWYL Mentor has established her EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you as Parents, and Blessing needs to do:

22/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 2 The business management cycle is comprised of five stages which include ;process  design ,modeling, execution ,monitoring  and optimization .Each  phase of the life cycle builds on the previous one and the result is an effective and efficient BPM system that meets the needs of the organization .To  begin with, process design is a method a company can use to understand its processes and how it can improve them .This  can be especially important if a company wants to expand or reach new customers with efficient operations .For  example, if a company plans to develop a new product or service,it can use process design because it can help guide development and ensure to align the item with company values at each stage.It is important to understand process design because it can help you to analyse and manage a company's operations. Moreover modeling gives organisations a simple way to understand and optimize workflows by creating data driven visual representations of key business processes .Execution is about having the employees required to support a company's strategy and making sure they are doing what the company needs them to do to achieve its strategic goals .Monitoring  is a continuous management function to  assess if progress is made in achieving expected results to help in implementing whether there are any unidentified effects .Business  optimization is the process of identifying and implementing new methods that make the business more efficient. This includes reducing costs while improving performance. In conclusion the importance of BPM is that it enables organisations  to align business functions with customer needs.
22/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 3 Business contributes to economic development because attracting and growing businesses strengthens our economy providing locally produced goods that allow for a higher quality of life .Businesses  create jobs by hiring employees to carry out various tasks and functions. This increases the overall employment rate ,providing individuals and families with income ,which they spend on goods and services ultimately stimulating economic growth .If  there is an increase in economic growth it means that real GDP is increasing. Businesses have the power to create positive changes that can benefit both their own  success as well as the economy at large .For  example ,the  strong businesses pay taxes that go for vital services such as schools, roads and infrastructure thus help in improving economic development.
22/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 4 Managerial skills is the knowledge and ability of the individuals in a managerial position to fulfil some specific management activities or tasks .For  example, reasoning is one of the main skills needed to be effective at decision making ,at school reasoned with my fellow colleagues so that we should write an exam .I  was able to come up with all the benefits and limitations of every possible solution before taking the exam such that everyone was convinced that they wanted to write the exam.
22/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 5 Human resource management is the strategic approach to nurturing and supporting employees and ensuring a positive workplace environment. Recruitment and hiring is perhaps the most popular role associated with HRM managers. It involves finding ,reviewing  credentials ,screening and selecting candidates for a company .It  makes sure that it recruits employees that have the right skills and qualifications for the organisations to be able to achieve its organizational goals. It is also responsible for training and development of workers in order to improve their skills such that employees will be motivated to work hard hence productivity will increase in the organization.
23/09/23, 4:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to reconnect with you earlier, I was caught up with a few meetings yesterday and hence I could not attend to your messages.
23/09/23, 4:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Tinomutendashe, thank you for these updates, and I appreciate your assistance in bringing Blessing home from school.

Although our team may not be available over the weekend, I can personally arrange a time to connect with you and Blessing today between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Our primary objective is to ensure that Blessing remains aligned with her peers in completing her admission procedures.

Could you please confirm if you'll be available within this timeframe for a discussion that should last approximately 30 minutes? Your active engagement during this conversation is greatly valued.
23/09/23, 5:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, addressing your message regarding the A-Level results, since Blessing is sitting for her exams this year, you can share her statement of entry in the meantime. This will help us keep her admission process on track while we await her final results.
23/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good evening Vilsha. Thank you very much for committing your time to connect with us and Blessing. Unfortunately, Blessing had been released for just one night by the school authorities and she has gone back. Furthermore, we have been advised that she won't be available until the 17th of November since they are busy preparing for their examinations which are just by the corner. On the same note, I will not be available for evening sessions until Tuesday the 26th. Any inconveniences caused are sincerely regretted.
23/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 493 1133: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Statement of entry👆🏻
25/09/23, 8:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Thank you very much for taking the time to communicate with us and for sharing Blessing's statement of purpose.
25/09/23, 8:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Please extend our regards and wishes to Blessing for her exams. We understand the school's priorities during this crucial exam preparation period, and we appreciate your efforts in keeping us informed of Blessing's schedule.
25/09/23, 8:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Furthermore, thank you for providing an update regarding your own availability for our sessions. We will ensure to reschedule our next session accordingly once you are available after Tuesday the 26th.
25/09/23, 8:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, if you have any questions or require any assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to help you every step of the way and to plan Blessing's education the right way.
27/09/23, 4:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Following our recent discussion, I wanted to reach out and confirm your availability for our scheduled meeting today. This will allow me to double-check our schedules and ensure that we can connect at the designated time without any issues and are able to make progress toward your university admission journey.
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good evening Vilsha. Sorry for the late response, I can confirm that I am available now.
27/09/23, 6:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand Mr. Tinomutendashe and there is no need to apologize. I comprehend that life can become hectic at times. Moreover, I'm delighted to see that you are available for our discussion.

In light of our last conversation and the documents you have submitted, we have successfully completed the first and second steps in your admission process and with that, now it is time to progress to the third step, which entails university admission counseling.

Once again to confirm our records: the course Blessing has selected for her higher education is a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and it's my understanding that you're planning for her to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Very correct
27/09/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming the same. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing Blessing's scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with her chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for her higher education.
27/09/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting her application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive her application, they will take a day or two to evaluate her eligibility for the scholarship. If they find her eligible and decide to offer her a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/09/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of Blessing's precise annual educational expenses.
27/09/23, 6:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your daughter's application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/09/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 493 1133: So what will be the best way to go if she receives multiple offer letters?
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Mr. Tinomutendashe. Now among the various offer letters Blessing receives, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university she wishes to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made this decision, you have to proceed to reserve her scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/09/23, 6:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/09/23, 6:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume Blessing's counselor has also discussed the registration fee with you during her counseling sessions, correct?
27/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes, they have discussed about it
27/09/23, 6:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.
27/09/23, 6:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, Blessing has qualified for a scholarship on her tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 6:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for Blessing's higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
27/09/23, 6:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/09/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
27/09/23, 6:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/09/23, 6:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
27/09/23, 6:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
27/09/23, 6:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while Blessing is in her home country, your primary focus will be on paying her university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving her scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for her visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after her arrival in India.
27/09/23, 6:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once she completes the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Her "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits she earns through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards her annual university fees.
27/09/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Taken note of.
27/09/23, 6:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing Blessing's registration fee payment, her journey toward financial flexibility commences. Her EWYL credits can be applied to her university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as Blessing progress through her education.
27/09/23, 6:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
27/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 493 1133: That's great.
27/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
27/09/23, 6:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I would like to inquire if you have any questions regarding how the admission process unfolds and what the associated costs will be for Bleessing's admission and her pursuit of higher education.

If you don't have any questions at this time, I have some exciting news to share with you. Please let me know your preference so that we can proceed with our discussion accordingly.
27/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Well explained, we can proceed.
27/09/23, 6:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing @263774931133. With this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in Blessing's admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to Blessing's next set of steps.
27/09/23, 6:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing Blessing with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/09/23, 6:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: On that note, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving Blessing's offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure her scholarship seat and help her become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/09/23, 6:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Eagerly waiting for the offer letter.
27/09/23, 7:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, indeed Mr. Tinomutendashe. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
27/09/23, 7:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/09/23, 7:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
27/09/23, 7:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide Blessing with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we believe, we will shape a brighter future.
27/09/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes, we will.
27/09/23, 7:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct @263774931133. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/09/23, 7:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/09/23, 7:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plan brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year to retake the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/09/23, 7:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/09/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I am done.
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Ok
27/09/23, 7:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/09/23, 7:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
27/09/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 493 1133: That sounds very interesting.
27/09/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

Indeed @263774931133, with that, I am also delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain Blessing's fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve her fee structure throughout the entirety of her bachelor's education in India.
27/09/23, 7:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is her intended year of admission, she will remain safeguarded against such changes. Her fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Awesome.
27/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 7:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.* 

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped the same concept. Under benefit 3, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 7:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against Blessing's first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation also resonate with you? <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I am delighted to know that you are following through. Moving forward, in situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far?
27/09/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Following.
27/09/23, 7:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Mr. Tinomutendashe. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I would like to inquire whether you're familiar with how Blessing's scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that she doesn't have her A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 329 8426: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 493 1133: You may provide more information on it
27/09/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 493 1133: A slight edge indeed.
27/09/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 493 1133: True
27/09/23, 8:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Right Mr. Tinomutendashe, let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
27/09/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Reappear in A Level [Benefit Number 5]*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe the student will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once their results come in 2025, the student will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue their bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 8:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/09/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree [Benefit Number 6]*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on the student's A Level results, the student won't be able to continue with her bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for their exams and starting with their Bachelor's in 2025, if the student does not wish not to take a step back, he/she will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 8:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once the student completes their diploma course in India, he/she will be able to continue their bachelor's education and if she wants, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 493 1133: It's clear
27/09/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
27/09/23, 8:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career [Benefit Number 7]*

Now, let us consider that a student does not wish to reappear for her exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, they would be putting an academic stop to her career. In that case, the student will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which they have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Their earnings/money will be transferred to their bank account.
27/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
27/09/23, 8:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. As Bleessing's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Blesssing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for her offer letter?
28/09/23, 7:11 am - +263 77 493 1133: Yes.
28/09/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Tinomutendashe, 

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Blessing's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
28/09/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that Blessing's higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Tinomutendashe and Blessing,

I hope you all are doing well, and I find you in the best of spirits. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good afternoon Vilsha. Thank you very much for sharing the good news with us. I can't wait to share the same news with Blessing who is still in school preparing for her final year examinations. May you please pass our sincere gratitude to the admissions team for a job well done. I have now gone through the offer letter now.
06/10/23, 10:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am delighted to hear your positive response Mr. Tinomutendashe, and I am sure Blessing will be equally thrilled when she hears the news. I will also convey your gratitude to the admissions team.

07/10/23, 7:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: No worries at all, Mr. Tinomutendashe. I completely understand that life can get hectic and you might have a few prior commitments, and that is perfectly okay. I appreciate your openness in sharing your availability.

09/10/23, 5:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for the delay in responding to your message. I was unexpectedly pulled into a meeting, and with the subsequent weekend, our team was unavailable. This situation caused a temporary interruption in our communication and progress.
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that in mind, I wanted to reach out today to address the delay in our connection and explore a more effective way to move forward. Therefore, could you kindly share your availability for this evening so that we can reschedule our discussion about your offer letter? This will enable us to plan a conversation that accommodates both our schedules, ensuring a smoother and more productive exchange of information and effective planning of the next steps.
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 493 1133: It's ok Vilsha. We may connect at 1930hrs CAT.
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation, Mr. Tinomutendashe, 07:30 PM in the evening works perfectly for our discussion. I will mark that down, and we will connect at that time. Please feel free to prepare any questions you would like to discuss regarding the offer letter or any other aspects of Blessing's admission. 

Looking forward to our conversation at 07:30 in the evening!
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good evening. We may connect now.
09/10/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Mr. Tinomutendashe and Blessing,

Thank you for making yourself available for our scheduled discussion, I am pleased to see that you are available for our discussion. Without any more delay, I would like to commence our conversation regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University and ensure you have a clear understanding of the offer letter and its specifics.
09/10/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To ensure we are on the same page and can address any questions or concerns effectively, I kindly request you to take another look at the offer letter and provide me with the following details:

1. What is the per-semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What is the standard duration of your course?
3. What is the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable) mentioned in the offer letter?
4. Could you please confirm the Registration fee amount mentioned in the offer letter?

This information will help us proceed with a clear understanding of the offer letter and help us discuss the next steps accordingly.
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 1. USD$900
2. Three years
3. USD$300
4. USD$750
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Tinomutendashe, please excuse the message shared by Mr. Milan, he mistakenly attended to your message. However, I was able to go through the responses you shared, and thank you for sharing the same.
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 493 1133: OK, it's fine
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As outlined in Blessing's offer letter, her course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, her tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means her annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies Blessing's tuition fee structure for you?
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 493 1133: True
09/10/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
09/10/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in Blessing's offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if Blessing wants, she can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Students can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist them in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If students wish to save more on accommodation expenses, they can also look for accommodation on their own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 493 1133: OK. For the on campus accommodations, is the $2000/2500 per annum shared between or amongst the students sharing such accommodation or its per head.
09/10/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Tinomutendashe, the cost mentioned in the letter is specifically designated to cover the facilities and services provided to each individual student. The mentioned fee is exclusively intended for the particular student utilizing the facility, with the primary aim of ensuring that each student can fully benefit from the available resources. I trust this explanation provides a clearer understanding of your query?
09/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Ok
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. With this, I am certain you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and doesn't rush when it comes to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the importance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make an informed decision about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this aligns with your understanding of the university's approach?
09/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Mr. Tinomutendashe. As you can see in Blessing's offer letter, she has the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
09/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 8:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is reassuring to see you following through Mr. Tinomutendashe. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Blessing's overall cost of education.
09/10/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, Blessing's deadline for securing her scholarship seat falls on *October 20th, 2023.* I hope we are together so far?
09/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Understood.
09/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: So I should not worry myself about this once off Admission and Processing fee?
09/10/23, 8:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is the right understanding Mr. Tinomutendashe. At the same time, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Blessing through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that Blessing is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
09/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 8:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Blessing's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 20th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 20th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Well explained
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Blessing's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *October 20th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay @263773298426. Now, coming to the payment mode for Blessing's university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Zvishavane
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of Blessing's fee to him in the form of cash.
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 493 1133: In this case, will I get issued with anything that I will hold on to as proof of payment
09/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 493 1133: What about using Mr Charles Jerera's account details?
09/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
09/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for Blessing's enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for Blessing's university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
09/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank for you for clarifying this issue
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I still have Mr Jerera's banking details. I think I will go for this option since we have an FBC branch here in Zvishavane. This will help reduce traveling costs to Harare.
09/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Mr. Tinomutendashe. Since Mr. Jerera updated his banking details some time ago, I would like to share these updated details with you to ensure that you have the correct and current account information. Would that be acceptable to you?
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Very much acceptable
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you @263773298426. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Received, thank you
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Blessing at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
09/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
09/10/23, 9:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Tinomutendashe. Now that we have established Blessing's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/10/23, 9:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
09/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion Mr. Tinomutendashe. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Blessing with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/10/23, 9:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Blessing can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Blessing will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Her mentors will undoubtedly provide her with valuable guidance to help her reach his academic and financial goals.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Maybe some general questions.
1. Are there any chances of receiving more offer letters for Blessing from other universities so that we may compare the offers?
2. Maybe as an advice from the Admissions team, how do you rank Galgotias university academically with other universities in India?
09/10/23, 9:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you, @263774931133, for sharing your questions. I am more than happy to address each of your queries one by one, starting with the first one, and to assist you with the same. I would like to help you in understanding how the admission process for a student is conducted. Does that sound good to you?
09/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As of now, Blessing's application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Explained
09/10/23, 9:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now Mr. Tinomutendashe, as you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias University, Blessing would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias University and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Was not aware. After your explanation, I think it's good for us to take what is on offer right now. Thank you very much for shedding light on this one
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed, Mr. Tinomutendashe, that is the correct approach. To provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve Blessing's scholarship seat at Galgotias University by paying her registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if Blessing receives a better scholarship offer and decides to change her university, she will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that Galgotias University's offer is still the better choice, you can pursue her education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for Blessing's academic journey.
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Well explained.
09/10/23, 9:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263773298426. To illustrate this with an example: Let us assume you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve Blessing's seat there. Later on, Blessing receives a better offer from University A, where the registration fee is also $750.

If you decide to switch her admisison to University A, in that scenario, you would need to pay $750. However, because Blessing had already paid $750 to Galgotias University, this same amount would be adjusted against her fee at University A. Therefore, you would not need to pay any additional money to secure her scholarship seat at University A or to make the switch.

I hope this explanation clarifies the process, addresses your first query and provides you with a better understanding of how it works?
09/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Clarified
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Right Mr. Tinomutendashe. Now to attend to the second query of yours, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
09/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you for taking your time to explain everything in detail.
09/10/23, 9:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Mr. Tinomutendashe, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to share a few glimpses of the university and emphasize the importance of sharing Blessing's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
09/10/23, 9:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for Blessing and your family, as she has received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing her one step closer to realizing her dream of pursuing education abroad.
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for Blessing's admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us here in Blessing's admission group. 

We are here to support you every step of the way.
09/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Same to you Vilsha. We cannot thank you and the entire admissions team enough for tireless efforts in ensuring that our child gets the best assistence in her quest to study abroad. Stay safe. Until we meet again for our next session on Thursday.
14/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good day. Please find the attached proof of payment for the initial deposit of $300. The remaining balance will be paid on or before the 20th of November 2023.
17/10/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Blessing,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. I want to extend my apologies for not being able to reconnect with you over the past couple of days. We had some crucial meetings with one of our affiliated universities, Lovely Professional University.
17/10/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These meetings were focused on discussing the endowment benefits for the 2024 academic year, and hence, they were unavoidable. Due to these unexpected commitments, we couldn't check your messages earlier, and we appreciate your patience during this time.
17/10/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That being said, I am relieved and glad to inform you that we are now available to continue our discussion, and our focus can shift back to your admission process. If you and your family are available, I would like to inquire if we can reconnect and resume our conversation from where we left off?
17/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 493 1133: It's ok Vilsha. May we connect tomorrow at 1930hrs.
17/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Tinomutendashe. First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the payment receipt that you shared. We have duly noted it and have updated our accounts team. They will verify the payment and communicate with the university officials for confirmation.
17/10/23, 9:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Furthermore, now as you are aware we held a meeting with Lovely Professional University. I am sure you will be pleased to hear that we took advantage of this opportunity to expedite Blessing's scholarship application with the university. I am delighted to inform you that our efforts have proven successful, as the university has accepted her application and provided a scholarship offer letter for Blessing. Below, you will find the same offer letters for your review.
17/10/23, 9:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: We can reconnect tomorrow at 07:30 PM to discuss the offer letter further and guide you in selecting the best university for Blessing's higher education. Congratulations to you and your family on this achievement!
17/10/23, 9:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good evening team. I am ready for our session for the day.
18/10/23, 10:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, Mr. Tinomutendashe. Now that you have another offer letter for Blessing, I wanted to take this opportunity to inquire whether you have had the chance to thoroughly review the offer letter. 

It is crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter and determine which university would be the best fit for Blessing, so that we can proceed with her admission formalities for that specific university and help her start her academic journey on the right path.
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes, I went through the offer letter.
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through Blessing's offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have.
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s Blessing's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 493 1133: 1. $975
2. 3 years
3. $200
4. $700
19/10/23, 9:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses @263774931133. As you can see in Blessing's offer letter, her course is a three-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that she will have six semesters in her degree.

After the scholarship, her per semester tuition fee is $975 making her per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
20/10/23, 4:57 am - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
20/10/23, 9:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together @263773298426. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Lovely Professional University -
20/10/23, 9:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
20/10/23, 9:15 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

In addition to on-campus housing, there's an option for students to choose off-campus accommodation. Many international students in India have decided to reside outside the LPU campus as it offers a more cost-effective solution. The estimated cost for off-campus accommodation is approximately $1000 per year, covering expenses like rent, food, WiFi services, and basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

These off-campus accommodations are considered safe. Students have the flexibility to prepare their meals, and they also have the opportunity to connect with a community of Edoofians from Africa who are pursuing their studies at the same university.
20/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Understood
20/10/23, 7:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263774931133. If Blessing decides to stay on campus, the university officials will help her settle and will be taking responsibility for her well-being, her per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
20/10/23, 7:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help Blessing with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
20/10/23, 8:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that @263774931133. You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
20/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are connected. Before we proceed, I'd like to check if you have any questions or concerns regarding your conversation with Ms. Vilsha?
27/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 493 1133: No
27/10/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm happy to learn that Mr. Tinomutendashe, you don't have any questions at this point. As you can see in the offer letter, the registration fee for Lovely Professional University is $700, and to secure Blessing's scholarship spot at the university, you are required to make a $700 payment. May I know if you agree to the statement here?
27/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that you've already submitted $300 to secure Blessing's scholarship spot at Galgotias University and received an early decision grant of $150, the total payment made for reserving Blessing's scholarship seat is $450. This amount will be deducted from the $700 registration fee for LPU. As a result, you will only need to pay an additional $250 to confirm Blessing's seat at Lovely Professional University. Are you following along with this information?
27/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes
27/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you feel the offer letter from LPU is better and you would like to change Blessing's university, in that case, you have the transfer option made available to you using which you will be able to transfer Blessing's admission without paying any additional amount of money. 

So may I know if you have any queries so far?
27/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Maybe I may just need to be informed on which of the two universities is best academically so that we may make an informed decision on whether we should choose LPU or Galgotias.
27/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I completely understand your concern as a parent here, in that case, let me share a few insights about the Lovely Professional University with you. 

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students. 

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

27/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted, so from the information you have just shared with us, it is now evident that LPU is better than Galgotias University. Having said that, I think as a parent I will go for LPU.
27/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your decision, and it's great that you've carefully considered the information provided. Selecting the right university for your child's education is a significant decision, and indeed LPU is one of our best universities and you have certainly made the right choice. 

May I know if you have any more queries before we move ahead?
27/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 493 1133: No

Since you've made the decision to confirm Blessing's scholarship spot at Lovely Professional University, I shall inform the admission team and convey this information to the academic board as well. Once you complete the remaining payment of $250, the university will proceed to generate the official Admission Acceptance letter.
27/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, I'll wrap up our conversation for today, and we'll reconnect with you a few days before the deadline to assist with your financial preparations and address any concerns you may have at that time.

If you ever have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out, so we can discuss and help you plan your education effectively.
