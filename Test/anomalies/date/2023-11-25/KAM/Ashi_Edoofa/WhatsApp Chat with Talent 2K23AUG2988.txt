07/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Talent 2K23AUG2988)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
07/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Talent EWYL23E0649)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session on next Thursday, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups? <This message was edited>

07/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
07/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Despite the fact that they also get paid for EWYL, to me that's  cornerstone of Edoofa in that one will be strongly prepared for a successful carrier ahead. 

This is mainly defined by the Wisdom they will attain after undertaking such a rich programme and getting paid at the same time for such a priceless experience 

Thanks
07/09/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Greetings!                                                                                                l may not always be on time but I will always try my best to  catch up whenever I get a chance

08/09/23, 3:36 am - +263 71 510 5385: One thing of concern like Talent Mazarura has raised at the moment is his timetable considering he is writing his final exams next month and finishes November. 

Any possibility I fill in the necessary forms and submit. Then once he get a chance to be reachable we hear his comments since he is the one I believe can confirm if he will be able to balance writing exams and be doing EWYL at the same time or if there will be flexibility 

My thinking
08/09/23, 3:38 am - +263 71 510 5385: Am referencing his comment,  and since then I haven't heard him. 

Boarding school students not always reachable.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Ready
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Gone through kindly explain
12/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
12/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Crystal clear thanks
12/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes we are following
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes clear
12/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
12/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Happy this far
12/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

13/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
13/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Inspirational
13/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Thank u so much
14/09/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and Talent,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready? <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Afternoon,  ready
14/09/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
14/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes I watched and commented
14/09/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
14/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Edoofa has vast experience and its focusing on preparing Students to be more marketable on the job market on completion on their degree programme 

It also give you peace of mind knowing you are dealing with genuine and sincere people,  unlike other Agents with what is happening these day like human trafficking etc

Thanks
14/09/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/09/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
14/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes we are on the same page
We can go for the statement of purpose
14/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 871 0127: So l have gone through all the videos and cleared all my errors on certain aspects like how edoofians are encouraged to be open minded in the sense that edoofians should be able to see themselves standing besides a large pool of opportunities and not just see themselves as learners.
14/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
14/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
14/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
14/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

15/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if Talent was able to complete the above tasks?
15/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 510 5385: He is inconsistent because of power cuts
Zimbabwe is facing a power challenge 

I have not been in touch with him since last session 

So am not sure
15/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 510 5385: But looks like he hasn't submitted
15/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I understand that situations can be unfavorable sometimes. May I know if he might be able to submit them by Monday at 7:30 PM? <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 510 5385: I will ensure he does by then 
Thank you so much Shivjeet
15/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Same to you,  bye

It holds data and instructions that are actively used by the computer at any given time. Primary memory is volatile in nature, which means its contents are lost when the computer is powered off. Examples of primary memory include RAM (Random Access Memory) and cache memory.

RAM is a type of primary memory that stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. It provides fast read and write access, allowing the CPU to retrieve and modify data rapidly. RAM is used to temporarily store running programs, data needed for computation, and the operating system itself. However, its capacity is limited compared to secondary memory.

Cache memory is a smaller and faster type of primary memory that is located closer to the CPU. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time it takes to access information from the slower main memory. Cache memory acts as a buffer between the CPU and RAM, improving overall system performance.

Secondary memory, on the other hand, refers to long-term storage devices that hold data even when the computer is powered off. Unlike primary memory, secondary memory is non-volatile. Examples of secondary memory include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), magnetic tapes, and optical discs such as CDs and DVDs.

Secondary memory provides large storage capacities and is used for storing the operating system, software applications, user files, and other persistent data. It is slower to access compared to primary memory, but it offers the advantage of retaining data even during power outages or system reboots.

In summary, primary memory is the immediate and volatile storage used by the computer for active data and instructions, while secondary memory refers to long-term and non-volatile storage devices used for persistent data storage. Both primary and secondary memory play crucial roles in the overall functioning of a computer system.

17/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 71 871 0127: 3. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. Each layer represents a specific set of tasks and responsibilities, providing a structured approach to network communication.

The OSI model serves as a reference framework for designing and implementing network protocols and allows different systems to communicate with each other by defining a common set of rules and protocols. By dividing the network communication process into these distinct layers, the OSI model facilitates interoperability, scalability, and troubleshooting in complex network environments.

 Physical Layer: This is the lowest layer of the OSI model and deals with the physical transmission of data over the network. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of the physical medium, such as cables, connectors, and signaling.

 Data Link Layer: The data link layer provides error-free and reliable point-to-point data transfer between neighboring network nodes. It handles framing, error detection and correction, and flow control.

 Network Layer: The network layer enables the routing of data across multiple networks. It establishes logical paths (routes) between source and destination devices and determines the optimal path for data transmission.

 Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures reliable and transparent end-to-end data delivery. It segments and reassembles data into manageable units, performs error recovery, and manages flow control.

 Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It enables synchronization and checkpointing of data exchange, allowing reliable connections to be established.

 Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for data representation, ensuring that information sent by the application layer of one system can be understood by the application layer of another. It handles data encryption, compression, and formatting.

 Application Layer: The application layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with the end-user applications. It provides network services to applications, such as file transfer, email, and remote login protocols.

Python:
In Python, operator overloading is achieved through special methods, also known as dunder (double underscore) methods. These methods define the behavior of operators when applied to instances of user-defined classes. By implementing these special methods, you can specify custom behavior for operators. Python provides a wide range of special methods for operator overloading, such as `__add__` for addition, `__sub__` for subtraction, `__mul__` for multiplication etc

Java:
Unlike Python, Java does not have built-in support for operator overloading. In Java, operators have predefined meanings and cannot be directly overloaded for user-defined classes. However, Java does allow method overloading, which enables multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. While it is not the same as operator overloading, method overloading in Java can provide similar functionality by providing different methods for performing desired operations on objects.

C++:
C++ supports operator overloading as a core language feature. In C++, you can redefine the behavior of operators by defining operator functions or methods for user-defined classes. These operator functions are regular member functions with a special name that begins with the `operator` keyword followed by the operator symbol. For example, you can overload the `+` operator by defining the `operator+` method. C++ allows extensive operator overloading, enabling custom behavior for arithmetic, comparison, assignment, and other operators.

It is formed according to its resources,  culture, laws, and geography.  Looking at business economics,  that is financial, organizational, market-related, and environmental issues faced by corporations.  It then becomes critical to look at scarcity,  product factors, distribution, and consumption 

Technological advancement occurs when technologies or applied sciences become more precise, accurate, efficient, powerful, or capable.  They have made many important changes throughout history. Technology has made it possible for people from all walks of life to have access to different resources.  It is also being used to equip people who need a certain type of assistance to improve their quality of life like hearing aids and help them avail opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible. 

From a business perspective, the sector realizes the things that can satisfy its customers.  The businessmen can understand the customer's mindset effectively which helps them offer the customer what they are satisfied with thereby growing the market and hence the business. 

Technology enables automation, streamlining processes, and improving efficiency. It empowers businesses to produce more goods and services with fewer resources, thereby increasing productivity. This increased productivity leads to higher output levels and economic growth.

 Technology has transformed the way countries engage in trade and commerce. The internet, digital platforms, and advanced communication networks have facilitated global connectivity, allowing businesses to access larger markets, expand international trade, and participate in the global economy.

 Technology enables better resource management and optimization. Advanced analytics, data-driven decision-making, and smart systems help businesses and governments make informed choices, reduce waste, and optimize resource allocation. This efficiency leads to cost savings, increased productivity, and ultimately, economic growth.

18/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Talent,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 510 5385: It was fantastic thanks 
And yours?
18/09/23, 8:08 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Hope the assignment is pleasing,  Talent submitted last night
18/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Great thanks and yours?
18/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking.
18/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

19/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Talent.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
19/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Evening we ready
19/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Greetings we can proceed
19/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah its accurate
19/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
19/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes thanks we ready
19/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 510 5385: True
19/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Noted
19/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Noted
19/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Noted
19/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Okay noted thanks
19/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Noted
19/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Yes Counselor discussed the registration fee correct
19/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Same page
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Timelines would further clarify. 
As when it will be due
19/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Registration due in 2 weeks from when
19/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!
19/09/23, 10:58 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Good night
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Great how about you?
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
20/09/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with the above example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Well and you
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 510 5385: When is this amount likely to be requested
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Noted 
Thank you
20/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 871 0127: no
20/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process.
20/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Talent EWYL23E0649*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/HC59zYZfoZ290Vr9NV4Ri8"
20/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Talent Mazarura and my EWYL group name is Talent EWYL23E0649.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
20/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
21/09/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Talent.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 871 0127: good thanks
21/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yes we can proceed
21/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
21/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
21/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 871 0127: lovely
21/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
21/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 871 0127: done
21/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 871 0127: clear
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
21/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yeah
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, my available hours are coming to an end. We shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further proceedings of our session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/09/23, 10:31 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Good night
22/09/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Fine thanks how are you doing?
22/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
22/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
22/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 871 0127: No
22/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 871 0127: noted
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
22/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 871 0127: I am not aware of it , kindly enlighten me
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
22/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yeah
22/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 871 0127: clear
22/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
22/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Right
22/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yeah
22/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
22/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
22/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Clear
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
22/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
22/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
23/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
23/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Good progress
25/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Talent.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely evening?
25/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Fine thanks how are you doing?
25/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah we can proceed
25/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 871 0127: No
25/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
25/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yes
25/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
25/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
25/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Good night
26/09/23, 1:56 am - +263 71 510 5385: Thank you so much
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Talent!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Thank you so much
29/09/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 510 5385: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Talent!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
29/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 871 0127: 1. 1000USD  2) 4 years(8 semesters)   3) 300USD    4) 750USD
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($1000*2) = $2000. I hope you are clear about this. <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Isn't supposed to be 2000 USD per year?
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the confusion please, yet, it is $2000 per year. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 510 5385: When is the 750 due
29/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 510 5385: Registration
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that. Now, As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Not clear about the 300USD
29/09/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know what is not clear here?
29/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 871 0127: It is not part of the 750USD?
29/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please it is not a part of the registration fee, however, since it has been waived off, therefore, it means you do not have to pay it. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Clear
29/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Talent!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University. May I know if we can move ahead with the same here now?
30/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
30/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 871 0127: Morning How are you doing?
30/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 871 0127: I currently reside in Harare and My Father is currently residing in Malawi
30/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
30/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
30/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
30/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 871 0127: okay
30/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, alternatively, if your father would be making the payment from Malawi, then he can do that by making an international bank transfer on the details mentioned in the offer letter, as you did for your Enrollment Fee, is that clear?
30/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 871 0127: Yes
30/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000 <This message was edited>

Hope you understand what we are experiencing

Going forward will always prepare indvance

Thank you
13/10/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, I would like to mention that since the university had already given you the deadline of 13th October to make the payment, and that you were facing challenges in arranging the forex, may I know why did you not inform me of the same?
13/10/23, 2:40 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: I asked, no response
I had a problem with my phone, wanted to communicate same, but wasn't getting response

I had to buy another phone, charged my Zimbabwe WhatsApp to Malawi
13/10/23, 2:40 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Unfortunately where here now
13/10/23, 2:41 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Focused to change to Malawi WhatsApp
13/10/23, 2:43 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: If the can I agree, I will pay 600 instead before 13 November
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Talent!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, may I know if you have any date with yourself that by when in this month would you be able to get the money from the bank please?
16/10/23, 3:05 am - +265 983 20 93 06: Good evening
16/10/23, 3:07 am - +265 983 20 93 06: 4th November
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Talent!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, since you have already passed the deadline given by the university to make the payment of your registration fee, the university will revoke the scholarship offer. 

Being Talent's admission officer, I do not want that to happen, therefore, can you please let me know how much amount can you manage to pay in this month itself towards Talent's registration fee please?
16/10/23, 11:37 am - +265 983 20 93 06: Good morning
Since its due November am thinking will pay the 600 one time
16/10/23, 11:38 am - +265 983 20 93 06: Thereafter, when will be next payment
Wanna start planning in advance
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Talent!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is not true please. As per the offer letter that we have received the due date was of 13-Oct-2023 and since it has already passed, the registration fee is currently overdue. 

Now, from what you have mentioned about clearing the same in November, I understand that due to forex challenges, it might be hard, however, if you are planning to do that in November, then, it will be against the university's policy of deadlines, please. Hence, I advise you to plan and make the payment of the fee in this month itself, I hope you understand, right?
17/10/23, 12:12 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: How are you
Initially it was split as 300
13 October's and 300
13 November?
17/10/23, 12:13 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: So am suggesting I pay 600 once off?
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, however, as per the discussion that we had over the personal window, I believe you are clear about the same, right?
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Will send POP as discussed by tomorrow morning
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Yes agreed
17/10/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you.
17/10/23, 8:22 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: <Media omitted>

I trust you are in good health and in high spirits. As discussed over the call, we have received the payment receipt for your remaining part of the university registration fee and have duly noted it. Our accounts team will process the same receipt for the payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth process.

23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Talent,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
24/11/23, 12:34 am - +265 983 20 93 06: We are fine thanks and hope you fine as well

We are clear

Thank you so much for the update
24/11/23, 12:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265983209306, I am glad to hear that you have taken a note of my message.
24/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Greetings

Does this mean if I'm to get an offer from LPU, the deposit already sent can be transferred to LPU?
24/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely right @263718710127 Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
24/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. However, if feel comfortable with your current choice that's okay as well. Are you clear on this?
24/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 871 0127: clear
24/11/23, 7:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, in that case Wishing you a wonderful weekend and please extend our regards to your family as well!
24/11/23, 7:26 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Thank you
Looking forward to the offer letter
24/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Will do
