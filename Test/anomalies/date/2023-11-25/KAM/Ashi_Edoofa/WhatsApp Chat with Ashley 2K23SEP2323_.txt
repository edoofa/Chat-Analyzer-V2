05/10/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
05/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I am ready
05/10/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Am done
05/10/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/10/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes they're
05/10/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/10/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I am
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes
05/10/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure no problem
05/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that @263712783037 is back and I am looking forward to connecting with you. That is great news Ashley, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 278 3037: You are welcome
06/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 433 7203: From the videos i learnt to follow instructions,to always have an open mind and that EDOOFA is there to provide quality education
06/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos as well.
06/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 433 7203: From the remaining 2 videos i leart that the Edoofa program took about 10 years to identify the best schools and colleges for passionate edoofians
06/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Lastly i learnt that the statement of purpose is an important document and students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling the forms
06/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Thank you for enlightening me more on the videos i now have a better understanding
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes we are
06/10/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
06/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
06/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
06/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
07/10/23, 6:58 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes sir that's correct
07/10/23, 6:58 am - +263 78 433 7203: Good morning
07/10/23, 7:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well, since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/10/23, 7:52 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay no problem
07/10/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
07/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263784337203 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
07/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 433 7203: Let's start sir sorry for the delay i was in a study
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please.  As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 433 7203: Am back now
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes that's not practical
07/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yea he did
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes we are
07/10/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes i have
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
07/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay I understand
07/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
07/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I understand
07/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I have no queries
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Wow this is very inspiring
07/10/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it was heartwarming it meet them in real I hope you are excited to be in this picture as well for next year?
07/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 278 3037: We are praying day and night for this day to come through. We want to do everything for our Son.
07/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263712783037 I am sure he will make you proud. Before moving ahead. I would like to share some exciting news.

09/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
09/10/23, 11:00 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Sp sorry I was unavailable 
I can work with 12.30
10/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay i now understand
10/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I understand
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes i am
10/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes its very clear
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Oh that's great
10/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 433 7203: There are no queries
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes I am
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Thank you very much for the session
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 433 7203: My sessions are from 1.30 to 2.30 with my EWYL Mentor
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the time of your sessions with your EWYL Mentor @263784337203. Have a wonderful Journey ahead with your Mentor!
10/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Thank you
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 78 433 7203: Thank you very much
16/10/23, 7:57 am - +263 71 278 3037: We thank you so much, may God bless you all
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes it is
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure i understand
16/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 433 7203: We are
16/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes clear
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 433 7203: We are good
16/10/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 29th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
17/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 278 3037: Good morning Milan Singh, hope you are keeping well. We went through the offer letter from the University, our main challenge are the charges required, they are too dear for us this side. 
May you kindly try for a cheaper University for us, which offers better percentage on scholarship anything above 75%to 100%.
Our financial situation is not good at the moment. 
Please may you help me and my Son, he really needs to study there in India.
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, I understand the same and I am ready to help you with that here. Moving ahead, I would like to mention that we have shared Ashley's application with a few of our other partner universities as well that offer a higher quantum of scholarship and the costs for the same are towards a lower end. However, since we are waiting for a response from their side, what we can do is that we can complete Ashley's admission at Galgotias University and then use the transfer option to shift him to another affordable university later on. Are you aware of how the transfer option works?
17/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 278 3037: We are not aware, can you explain for us please.
17/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Not quite
17/10/23, 4:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 433 7203: So you're saying that $750 will be transferred to the better university
18/10/23, 3:30 am - +263 71 278 3037: Good morning Sir, we are finding it difficult to raise $750 within fifteen days or $300,and is there any cheaper University which charges less, plus the fees and accommodation it's too much for us from Galgotias University.
18/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 278 3037: Good afternoon Sir, let me run around and pay the registration fee for Galgotias University, God will help me, I will send you proof of payment.
18/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 278 3037: I really appreciate the work you are doing for my son, let me try my best.
18/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion here?
18/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes we have had our family discussions and we found our that it can be affordable to us
18/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I believe you are clear till here, right?
18/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes definitely
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 278 3037: It's easy for us to use Mr Charles FBC account
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 278 3037: Wants done I will send the proof of payment to you.
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 278 3037: Thanks so much
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 278 3037: Yes it's clear
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes please
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes we are
18/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 433 7203: No its all clear
18/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 278 3037: Thanks so much
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 278 3037: You can go ahead

I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?

19/10/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I would highly advise you to do so. Now, since the university has given you a date of 29th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes a little bit
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, which payment plan would you be choosing so that I can inform the university officials of the same as well?

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
