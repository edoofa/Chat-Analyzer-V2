12/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Mazvita,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Mazvita’s higher education?

11/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
11/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: By that time I would like you to share the following documents.

1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).

2. O-Level Results

3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)
12/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 791 4309: So far so good 😊
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 791 4309: I do not have any questions
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yess l am ready,l can not even wait to start the Admission process .
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
12/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yesss ma'am 😊
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Understood!
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted with thanks 😊.
12/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yess
12/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 791 4309: So when am l going to receive the offer letters if l may ask ma'am .
12/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as it was our dinner break, may I know if you are available to connect so that I can help you understand your query?
12/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes l am available
12/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
12/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes we can move ahead.
12/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Understood
12/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes ma'am
12/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yess ma'am.
12/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted ma'am
12/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted understood ma'am
12/10/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Understood.
12/10/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 791 4309: No ma'am
12/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 791 4309: I don't have any queries
12/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
12/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
12/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 791 4309: We are very very excited ma'am
12/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted with thanks 😊
12/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes l have reviewed all these benefits
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yess
12/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Mazvita, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Well noted.
12/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yess
12/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Understood ma'am.
12/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Can you please provide me with some information.
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mazvita.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Thanks ma'am it's now clear.
13/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now, that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Am now available ma'am
13/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 791 4309: How was your day??
13/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are available, thank you for asking, my day is going great I hope the same for you.
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Mine is great but the temperature are too high here because we are in summer.
13/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It sounds like you're experiencing quite a hot summer with those high temperatures. One of my students even told me it was a heatwave today.
13/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes that's true ma'am
13/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you rest well at home and stay healthy.

Now moving forward, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
13/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes ma'am l go through them.
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Yes
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted ma'am
13/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
13/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

Your parents kept us updated earlier today, and we will continue our discussion with them in your absence. Once you are available, you can follow through with the discussions from this admissions group.
18/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Additionally, @263772990787 I am glad to hear that you were able to review the offer letter. As we move forward today, we will delve into the specifics of this particular offer letter. I will provide you with detailed information about the admission process, explain how it was conducted, and guide you through the steps required to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of questions on your mind will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 791 4309: Noted👏🏾
18/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Noted
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss Mazvita's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Mazvita's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 299 0787: 1 $900
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 299 0787: 2 it's 3 years
18/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 299 0787: 3 when we received the offer we should pay $600 within 2 weeks or we can pay 300 at first then pay another 300 after a month
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and the responses you shared are sufficient for us to commence our discussion. As outlined in Mazvita's offer letter, her course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for her degree. 

With the scholarship offered, her tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means her annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 299 0787: 3.we pay $600
18/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Yes
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Mzavita can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Mazvita will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist her in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Mazvita as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Is this $2000 shared between the 3 girls in the same room??
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 299 0787: On this $1200 is there food ??
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 299 0787: I think she can opt for off campus accommodation,I also need your guidance is it safe to live off campus
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely @263772990787, the food cost is indeed included in both accommodation options, as well as other facilities and services provided by the university. It's designed to ensure that each student residing in the accommodation is well-equipped and has access to essential resources to support their academic journey and overall well-being.
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, I am certain you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and doesn't rush when it comes to accommodation arrangements.
18/10/23, 10:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: They understand the importance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make an informed decision about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this aligns with your understanding of the university's approach?
19/10/23, 3:14 am - +263 77 299 0787: Noted
19/10/23, 9:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263772990787, as a student, Mazvita has both accommodation options (On-campus and Off-campus) available to her for you both to consider. As her admission officer, I can assure you that Off Campus Accommodations are entirely safe. All the accommodations are located within gated communities and have 24-hour CCTV surveillance to ensure security.

If you lean towards off-campus accommodation, we, as a team, will also assist you in finding the right accommodation that suits your preferences. I hope this brings some relief, and this addresses the query you had regarding the accommodation?
19/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 299 0787: Good Morning 
Ok that's good
19/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 299 0787: Yes I am relieved
19/10/23, 10:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good morning to you as well @263772990787. In light of the same, I am sure you must have heard from other students as well that every student under Edoofa is like a family. During their stay in India, we act as their guardian and ensure that they do not face any kind of challenge. 

Parents send their child to higher education in India on the belief that the Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, students' safety and security is the utmost priority. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For all of our students, we would be there at the airport to receive them and escort them to their respective universities, with all the universities associated with Edoofa, the student accommodation is taken care of by the university officials and once the students have settled, the Edoofa Team visits the campus on a regular basis to ensure that no student is facing a challenge.
19/10/23, 10:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: When you enrolled Mazvita in the Edoofa Program, you entrusted us not only with her university admission responsibility but also with the planning for her higher education and ger well-being, hence you can rest assured now and be confident about the choices you are making for her educational plans.
19/10/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 299 0787: I'm happy to hear that,thank u
19/10/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 299 0787: Noted
19/10/23, 10:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772990787. Continuing the discussion regarding Mazvita's offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 10:16 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 299 0787: Ok noted
19/10/23, 10:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Mazvita's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 10:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 299 0787: Yes we are on same page
19/10/23, 10:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that @263772990787. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Mazvita's through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 299 0787: Yes
19/10/23, 10:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Mazvita's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 10:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Mazvita's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 299 0787: Ok this month will pay $300 and pay another $300 in November
19/10/23, 10:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that @263772990787. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 10:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 299 0787: Can l use visa card for the payment?
19/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 299 0787: Harare is my domisal
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 299 0787: What about other payment platforms..
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 299 0787: .
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: @263772990787 once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 299 0787: Ok will talk to Mr Rajan
19/10/23, 11:59 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263772990787. I hope you were able to go through my above message as well regarding the payment through Mr. Shorwi;s FBC Bank?
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Yes
19/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 299 0787: I will go for Rajan ,,he is cheaper
19/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Mr*
19/10/23, 12:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please, that would be absolutely fine. Regarding your query about making the payment through the Visa card, you certainly can. The payment can be made online through PayPal. Please note that there is a 10% transfer charge for international payments through PayPal. We will assist you with the PayPal invoice one day before your intended payment date to ensure a smooth process.

Additionally, using the Visa card, you can make the payment through Edoofa's website: [https://www.edoofa.com/](https://www.edoofa.com/). The transfer charges for this option are the same as PayPal. You will find the payment button in the middle of the page, as shown in the screenshot below.
19/10/23, 12:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Ok I will come back to you when paying
19/10/23, 1:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That would be absolutely fine @263772990787. Now to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Mazvita at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Ok i understand
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Crystal's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 299 0787: I'm glad to hear this

19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263772990787. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Mazvita with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Mazvita can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 299 0787: Thank you it is an advantage to us as parents will be paying the remaining $1800
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed, it is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Mazvita will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Her mentors will undoubtedly provide her with valuable guidance to help her reach her academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 299 0787: For now i don't have any queries
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 299 0787: True i don't doubt her
19/10/23, 3:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
