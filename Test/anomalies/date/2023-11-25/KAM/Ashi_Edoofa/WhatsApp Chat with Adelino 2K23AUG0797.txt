I must say, your family, must be proud of you and must be working towards providing you with the best opportunities to kick-start your career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
14/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 486 3620: My counselling session was pretty good and I learnt a lot. The Edoofa program helps students to learn and develop job skills and with affordable school fees

14/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Adelino 2K23AUG0797)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
14/08/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Adelino EWYL23E0537)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes I am
14/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two Whatsapp groups. Moving forward, I am sharing a feedback form with you, I would like you to please take some time and fill out the same with your honest opinion, as it will help us and the entire team at Edoofa to work better and help the students with utmost care and importance.
14/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/08/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes I am following
16/08/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/08/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes they are clear
16/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/08/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes we may proceed
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
16/08/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 608 4528: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 486 3620: I will be done by 8:30pm right now my Internet connection is  weak
16/08/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
16/08/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Okay I will be available.
16/08/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation may I know if you are available to connect?
16/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Good evening am now available
16/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
16/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes I have gone through them.
16/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
16/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Okay.
From the videos I understood that students my be open minded and teachable and above all they must be in a good position to follow the instructions. Since in some countries there are issues of unemployment and it is very expensive for the students to have access to higher education which is (tertiary level), Edoofa will then offer scholarships and make education affordable by the the program called Earn While You Learn  (EWYL). This program helps the students to study as the work and it helps students to acquire many skills on practical rather than basing on theory.I also understand that Edoofa is also focused on increasing student's capacity for success ,that is making students more responsible and independent.

The founders of Edoofa encourage students follow Instructions and mentioned above so as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institution.
16/08/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes
16/08/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
16/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 486 3620: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes please
16/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
16/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
16/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

*2. O-Level Results*

16/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Thank you

16/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm. Have a great night.
16/08/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Thank you.

17/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 486 3620: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Today am sending
17/08/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
17/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 486 3620: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 486 3620: <Media omitted>

17/08/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, and the academic documents I shall wait for your response for question 1.
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes please
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
17/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes it is clear
17/08/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
17/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Yes I am following
17/08/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
17/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 608 4528: All the fees are stated fairly and may I ask Abt transportation of the student to India here it's not stated
17/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query @263786084528, however, please understand this is just an example for your better understanding of the cost break down, since your year of intake is 2024, your admission process shall commence after August 2023, and everything will be explained to you step by step then onwards. 

I hope we are clear here?
17/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Very clear
17/08/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Okay.
17/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day ahead.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Thank you.
At what time are we going to start tomorrow ?
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After 12.30 pm @263784863620
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 486 3620: Okay thank you
17/08/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

19/08/23, 8:09 am - +263 78 486 3620: Goodmorning 
Hello Admission officer , I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Tenzin
09/09/23, 9:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Adelino,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Adelino's higher education?
09/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Good afternoon having network problems
09/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 608 4528: We are all very well thank you yes we are preparing bit by bit
17/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Adelino.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
18/09/23, 6:04 am - +263 78 608 4528: We are well thank you and how are you,3:00pm will be alright with us
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes
18/09/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes
18/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 608 4528: But as a clever student he can use option 2
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/09/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
18/09/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/09/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes
18/09/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/09/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Understood
18/09/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 608 4528: I have no query
18/09/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Adelino's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Adelino is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
18/09/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Wonderful. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Ok thank you so much
18/09/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
20/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Adelino!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 608 4528: Thank you so much
20/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 608 4528: Good morning
20/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 608 4528: I am done
20/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 486 3620: Thank you so much
20/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 486 3620: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so happy about the offer letter please. Moving ahead, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 608 4528: 1)$900,2)3years and it's 6 semesters,3)$300 and 4)$750
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes it's clear
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Understood
20/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 608 4528: It's clear
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Very clear
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Mashonaland central province
20/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 608 4528: That will easy for us thank you
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please.  Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Thank you
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Clear
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Clear
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 608 4528: So far I don't have questions maybe if I would share this information to the family they might have questions but for now I'm clear
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Beautiful
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Yes please thank you we will do that as a family
20/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome dear! Have a good day ahead.
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 608 4528: Thank you same to you
22/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Adelino!

26/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now, since you had already paid the complete Enrollment Fee, and for your registration you were meant to pay $300, can you please help me in understanding the reason behind paying $150 please?

04/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 246 3441: *STOP RAISING AN OVER-DEPENDENT GENERATION !!!!*
 (Long Read)

Most parents of today are raising an *OVER DEPENDENT GENERATION* !!! All in the name of wanting to be there or providing for my kids

1. You cook their food for them so that they can read and enjoy it. *Mwana anosvika grade 7 asingagone kana kubika zai chairo..*

2. You help them to wash their clothes and tidy their rooms. *Mwana anongomuka ongobuda kana kuwaridza or kupeta magumbeze haaaite.. mutsvairo or broom anobata pamunotenga chete*

3. You drop them off in school every day by yourself! *Mwana anosvika Form 6 asingagone kupinda mutwn nemakombi or kuti makombi anokwirirwa papi haazive..*

4. You lie on their behalf to get them out of trouble. *Mubereki kungosupoorter mwana usina kunzwa kuti chii chaitika.. kiunyebera maticha about homework..*

5. You arrange "expo" to help them pass their exams. *Kutsvaga bepa kuti wako mwana apase..kumuendesa kunaexaminer anomupa revision ichauya kuzama..*

6. You protect them from every danger and difficulties. *Mwana wangu haafanire kupinda paQue, panhamo chaipo unoenda necooler box.. kikikoko ko pauchafa iwe*

7. You prevent them from any form of pain and suffering. *Haa mwana wangu haangarwadziwe ndiripo musiye ndokukura kwacho ikoko*

8. You don't want them to suffer like you did as a child. *But kutambudzika kwawakaita made u who u are today.. unotsvagira mwana zvese pamba pana maid. Garden boy, guard, driver zvese anazvo. Maihwee zvangu*

9. You hustle around while they watch films and play games. *Ndiwe unobinduka nekutsvaga nekushanda even mugarden vana ma form 4 nema upper six vachita magame chavanoziva malatest movie and video games nokuita nharo kuti Man U inozviita chete*

10. They can't go out alone because you're always scared. *Mwana pamusika chaipo uno Sisi perekedzai mwana iye ari form 2*

11. You take every decision for them because you're wiser. *Siya mwana asarudze zvaarikuda, hembe ndiwe unosarudza toy ndiwe unosarudza food ndiwe unosarudza*

12. You go to their schools to fight for them and prove human rights. *Mwana akarohwa naHeadmaster kanaTicha kwako kumhanya kundovhurisa docket uchiti ngaakandwe kuseri.Hauna nguva yekutsvaga chaita kuti mwana arohwe . Kana ari mudzimai wako aChihera kwakuenda kunopopota non-stop kuchikoro ikoko. Unokohwa chete*

13. You defend them even when they're wrong and at fault. *Hamumirire kunzwa nyaya yewako mwana.. Chako kungoti wangu haanzwarwo. Mmmmmhh*

14. You can not stand seeing them starve or go hungry for once. *Mwana ngaazive kuti food inomboshaikwa mumba today sadza nemutetenerwa kana kudya zviripo.Zviya zvekuti handidye maGreen. Mwana ngaaudzwe kuti unogona kuswerera mvura nokuti haiuraye*

15. You fight against those who try to correct them. *Wangu mwana haatsiurwe nokuti akaita seyi.Shuwa mwana wototyisa muraini. Saka iwe ndiwe unoswera naye here unoti haatsiurwe.. Unokohwa chete*

*I PITY YOU.....YOU ARE BUSY RAISING AN OVER-DEPENDENT GENERATION !!!*

*Do you think you are showing them, LOVE?* BIG NO

*SORRY, YOU'RE WRONG HAMA* !!!!

By the time you're no longer there and they face real-life challenges, *they will become helpless and dwarfed* !!!

At that stage, they will realize the havoc you have done to them and *CURSE YOU !!!*

STOP RAISING AN OVER-DEPENDENT GENERATION !!!

*Allow these children  to face the REALITIES of life kwete kuBreeder dummy children !!!*

Be careful !!!

Have a wonderful and blessed week  Amen.
