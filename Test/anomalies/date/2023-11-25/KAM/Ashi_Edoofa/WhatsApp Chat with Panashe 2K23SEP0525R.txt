This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?

14/09/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups. Moving forward, It's reassuring to hear that. I had a recent conversation with your counselor, Ms. Harmehak during which she provided me with some insights into Panashe's academic background and her career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring she has access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

15/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Ok
15/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 414 5407: I have understood
15/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
15/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes well clear
15/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
15/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
15/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes am following
15/09/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Sorry I have seen the message now
15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Thank you very clear
15/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 414 5407: It's okay let's proceed
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
15/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Thank you I will go through them tomorrow when I have smooth internet connection
15/09/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect on Monday at 09.00 pm, I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time.
16/09/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 414 5407: Good morning noted with thanks
18/09/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
18/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Good evening sure we managed to go through all the videos
18/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes we were able to through the videos
18/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 323 8283: From the first video which was teaching about important messages of enrolled students ,l got to know that successful Edoofian students should be able to have a vision.  Since they are given tasks and projects sometimes to prove there capabilities they should be able to prove that they are capable enough . They should be innovative, creative and also they should be exemplary.  Not only that but in addition should also be able to follow instructions

From the second video which teaches about the Edoofa's vision for you  l learned that Edoofa does not only provide educational facilities to students but it also identifies the children's abilities.  It also gives them a chance to please then for there capabilities and they motivate students to show case there talents . Along side education they empower students to be an to find themselves in the real world

From the third video l got to learn that Edoofa helps students in getting enrolled in different universities and they gives students a chance to explored different experiences.  This video showed how students enjoyed there journey and experiences they are having in these schools

Prepation for interactive sessions as the last video l got to know that it is the important step towards securing a good scholarship as it proves how delegate a student is
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Ok noted and thank you

19/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 323 8283: UI/UX refers to User Interface and User Experience, two closely related disciplines in the field of design. 

User Interface (UI) focuses on the visual and functional elements of a product or website that users interact with. It includes elements such as buttons, menus, forms, and layout. UI design aims to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the product.

User Experience (UX), on the other hand, is the overall experience a user has while interacting with a product or website. It encompasses every aspect of the user's journey, including their emotions, perceptions, and cognitive responses. UX design involves understanding the user's needs, conducting user research, and creating wireframes and prototypes to ensure a smooth and satisfying user experience.

The purpose of UI/UX design is to make products and websites user-friendly, engaging, and effective. A good UI/UX design can enhance user satisfaction, improve usability, and ultimately lead to greater user adoption and business success.

In today's digital age, UI/UX plays a crucial role in the success of products and websites. With the increasing expectations of users for seamless and convenient experiences, businesses need to invest in UI/UX design to differentiate themselves from competitors and meet user demands.

In conclusion,we can say UI/UX design is a multidisciplinary field that combines visual design, psychology, and user-centered thinking to create compelling and intuitive user experiences. Its importance in today's technology-driven world cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts user satisfaction, engagement, and the overall success of digital products and websites.
19/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 323 8283: 3) What is your understanding of the OSI model 

OSI stands for (Open System Interconnection)
This refers to a model of communication designed by the international standard organization that allows computers from different manufacturers to be connected together .
The OSI model has 7 layers which are :
1)Physical layer
This is responsible for sending and receiving data across a Physical medium. Data is in bits of a 1 or a 0

2) Data link layer
It provides error checking and formats data for Physical transmission and packet sequencing 

3)Network layer
It adds sequencing and address information,  sets logical protocols

4)Transport layer
It allows for error correction during transmission, maintains flow control and allows data recovery 

5) Session layer
Creates and terminate sessions and is responsible for deciding the communication method

6)Presentation layer
It deals with how information is presented and it adds formatting 

7) Application layer
defines how user applications interface or access communication services
19/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 323 8283: 4)What do you understand by programming and programming languages? Which languages are most widely used in today's applications and why

Programming is a set of symbols in computer language that are used in coding computer programs

Programming languages refers to a specially written code used for writing application program for example Visual Basic, COBOL, Pascal 

Programming languages are 
High levels languages 
Low level languages 

High level languages are widely used nowadays because they are easier  to understand. 
They are also easier to learn .Also they are easier to work with for example correct errors  and to test programs 
High level languages also are problem oriented and therefore can be used on any computer as they are not machine dependent
19/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 323 8283: 5) What is the difference between compilers and interpreters 

Compilers are programs that convert high level language program into its machine code equivalent at one go and then run it whereas interpreters are programs that translate and run one instruction of a program at tone before going to the next instruction until the end of the program.

An example of a compiler is a COBOL compiler whilst an example of an interpreter is the BASIC interpreter 

Compilers are slow in running programs for the first time whereas interpreters are fast when compared to Compilers when running programs at the first time 

Interpreters can easily be debugged whereas Compilers are difficult to find errors in compiled program  


 Interpreters do not produce an object code of a source code and it is difficult to use since conversion takes place every time the program run whereas Compilers creates an object code of a version of the source code

21/09/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe.

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Panashe EWYL23E0674*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FEtF2X4hrE9FmqDL0HxXzx"
21/09/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Panashe Nedziwe and my EWYL group name is Panashe EWYL23E0674.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
21/09/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
21/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Noted
21/09/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have joined the EWYL group and are connected with your EWYL mentor.
21/09/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the Statement of Entry for A -level, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Good afternoon Panashe is not available at the moment am the only one who is available at the moment and I have joined the group
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright in that case, you can share this message in the EWYL group and let the mentor know that Panashe will be avalable later, and once connected with the EWYL mentor update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Okay noted
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Ok
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Hello Admission officer, l have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms.Aditi
21/09/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I wish you a wonderful journey ahead with your Mentor!
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm to continue with our discussion as our available working hours are over for now, I hope you will be available.
21/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Ok
21/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/09/23, 6:00 am - +263 71 323 8283: Good morning
22/09/23, 6:00 am - +263 71 323 8283: Am sorry l couldn't connect yesterday because my network was tripping
25/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes l can see that
25/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Ok
25/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Understood
25/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes they have
25/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes we are
25/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Oky l have noted the example
25/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Oky l understand
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 323 8283: L just wanted to know if the costs of visa and flight expenses are part of the $500 _750 or its separate
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Am really sorry my network has been bad lately am at school so l face this challenge very much
25/09/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, thank you for sharing your query, let me help you explain. The flight and the visa cost is not included in the registration fee, please.
25/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Oky
25/09/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/09/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes we are really excited
25/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Thank you so much
25/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes am done
25/09/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes yes
25/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 7:27 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes it does
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so we were unable to connect with you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 323 8283: Good morning too you 

Am really sorry for not being available we are writing mock examination and l hardly get time to come online so will you please bear with me
27/09/23, 8:20 am - +263 71 323 8283: L have been needing to ask that am l going to make this payments after my A level results are out
27/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 414 5407: Good morning too you noted with thanks
27/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright please, I understand I hope you prepared well for your mock exams. Now coming back to your question let me help you understand. This fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university before the A -level results are out as the university will be able to generate the offer letter with the Statement of entry for A- level and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first tear cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
27/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Oky it's clear now
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 323 8283: What if we fail to pay the amount by the due date will be disqualified from the process
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Good afternoon to you too
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why is that you think that you will not be able to pay the amount by the due date?
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 323 8283: L just wanted to know so that we avoid that happening in the future
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 7, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 7, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 7, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 414 5407: No we don't have. It's clear
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 414 5407: We have followed the details
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Am not aware of this process may you kindly provide me with the information
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Thank you very much I have understood
27/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yaa sure I think so
27/09/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes thats true
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Good afternoon am available but Panashe is not available right now she is in lesson at school
29/09/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, I understand and it is alright, please. So may I know if you have any queries so far?
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 414 5407: No i don't have so far so good
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 414 5407: I agree with benefit Number 6
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/09/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes am
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes i am
29/09/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
29/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Noted
29/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 414 5407: I did not get you may you kindly explain further
29/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774145407 I just wanted to know here that do you have any doubts with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 414 5407: OK thank you I don't have any doubts
29/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now as Panashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Panashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes am very excited for the next step and as well as offer letter
30/09/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

I hope you are doing well. 

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
07/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 414 5407: Good morning to you too
07/10/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 323 8283: Good morning to you too
07/10/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes l was able to go through the letter
07/10/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
07/10/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 323 8283: What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?    $1800
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?  3 years
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?  $300
4. What's your Registration fee?$100
07/10/23, 9:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here Panashe, however, when it come to point number one, I believe the amount that you have written is not right, hence can you please take a look at the letter again and then let me know of the same.
07/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 323 8283: 1 it's 900
07/10/23, 9:16 am - Milan Edoofa: That is very right please. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
07/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes it is
07/10/23, 9:37 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
07/10/23, 9:37 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
07/10/23, 9:37 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
07/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky l understand
07/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 323 8283: So if l decide to be off campus ,will l be able to find an apartment easily or they are hard to find
07/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Off-campus accommodations are readily available for all the students. On that note, I would also like to mention that the university officials along with the Department of student welfare at Edoofa will help you with that. I hope this is clear?
07/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes thank you
07/10/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
07/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes we are together on this
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Good evening to you
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Am sorry for not being available because l was in  study
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 323 8283: Yes we are
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Good afternoon yes we are
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 277 7103: Good afternoon so far so good
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 20th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 20th November 2023.*
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *20th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes we are prepared to pay $300 before 20th October 2023 and $300 before the 20th November 2023
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes we stayed in Harare
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: \He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Noted with thanks
10/10/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
11/10/23, 5:33 am - +263 77 414 5407: Good morning OK no problem but I think I will prefer to Mr Rajan because his transfer rate is low
11/10/23, 11:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions.

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?

16/10/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?

16/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 323 8283: L got to know different activities that are done at the school besides learning which includes sporting activities such as basket ball . L also got to know how students study and interact when they are doing the same program. L also got to see former students who graduated and how they were happy to have achieved their goals
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! Galgotias University is indeed renowned for its academic excellence and the experience it offers to the students. As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 20th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
16/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 414 5407: Yes we are paying $300 tomorrow and the rest before 20th of November 2023
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 414 5407: So shall we use payment through Mr Rahan since you said his charges are low
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can do that as well, based on your choice!
