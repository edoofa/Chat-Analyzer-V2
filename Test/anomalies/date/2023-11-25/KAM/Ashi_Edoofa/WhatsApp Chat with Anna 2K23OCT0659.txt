20/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes we can start
20/10/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes you can explain in detail
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely @263780165700 Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
20/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes it's crystal clear
20/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
20/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
20/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
20/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay
20/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay

20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
20/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes it's clear
20/10/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
20/10/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/10/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

21/10/23, 10:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 016 5700: I also understand that Edoofa does not only focus on studying but it gives students space to interact with other many people and engage in different activities
21/10/23, 10:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 016 5700: Yes thank you
21/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263780165700. Looking forward for your response on other two videos.

Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 016 5700: The fourth video is failing to download

21/10/23, 10:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263780165700
21/10/23, 10:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/10/23, 10:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

25/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 016 5700: I have understood this
25/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, Let me clarify with the example as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 016 5700: Okay thank you for making understand on that one
25/10/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263780165700. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 11:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 11:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among the peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 016 5700: What is an endowment plan
25/10/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Endowment Plan is a bucket of benefits which helps the student financially, we are discussing it's benefits point wise.
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay fine
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes l understand
25/10/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes
25/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes l am following
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes can you provide more information on it
25/10/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay l understand now
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes that is true
25/10/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes that is it
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, they will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for the exams, and their scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes it's crystal clear
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes l am
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 747 0436: What is needed to secure the seat
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777470436 We only needed your confirmation to go ahead with your application.
25/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay sorry I was offline go ahead
25/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Sorry on the registration fee is there any payment plan

25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay thank you

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

14/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263780165700
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 016 5700: How are you
15/11/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Anna,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes l did go through the letter may you explain further for better understanding
15/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I am fine and you
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Thank you so much
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777470436. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 016 5700: 1. $1250
2.$0
3.$0
4.$125
5.$1000
15/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details @263780165700 . As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay so much is needed to be paid besides admission fee
15/11/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Anna's annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay I get it
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 747 0436: So for the first year total fees will be reduced from admission fee ($1500_ $1000) or it's $1500 +$1000)
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777470436 We will shortly assist you on your query, I hope that's okay.
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay we are ready
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes
15/11/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes
15/11/23, 6:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 6:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Ok
15/11/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Yes
15/11/23, 6:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of Anna's application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship. This is the reason her per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000)
15/11/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Anna's first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
15/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay why is my program not changed as l requested
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay
15/11/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding that dear, Could you please let me know if you have received the mail from the academic board?
15/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 016 5700: No l haven't
15/11/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me confirm that from the team @263780165700
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Anna is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 016 5700: I opt for the second one
15/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I would prefer to save $850 and pay higher registration fee
15/11/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
15/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 016 5700: I agree
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Okay now l get l opt for this one the first one
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 016 5700: Yes
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Yes
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Anna through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Yes you can explain
15/11/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Anna's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I think I got it.the payment plan is the way to go
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Ohhh so it will be $850.thank you
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Mutare
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Jerera for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Yes you can
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
*Bank:* FBC
*Account Holder's Name:* Charles Jerera
*Account Number:* 5333 0380 1404 8828
*Swift Code:* FBCPZWHA

15/11/23, 7:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777470436, You can choose any option which is convenient for you
15/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 747 0436: How about the ecocash method
15/11/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me dear @263777470436, We are not aware about this.
15/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 747 0436: It's okay
15/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I now understand it

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
18/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 747 0436: My question is on the university how do you rate it is it one the best universities.secondly the issue of changing the program are you working on it.
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I am sorry my daughter is not available today
18/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding your query about changing your program I want to share that we have successfully submitted your application for evaluating and make the necessary changes. Please be assured we will share an update with by next week.
18/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263777470436, MVN University is the good university, It is recognized as one of the leading university in India and from past few years, It has consistently stood out among rest of the university. We believe it is the right fit for Anna if you are considering affordability as the metric. 

The university does not only focuses on the affordability and insures that the student are able to get the higher quantum of scholarship but it also has certain facilities that ensures that the student to faculty ratio is the lowest and the personalized attention are given to the students and it is one of the university that focuses on the holistic development. However it seems like you are concerned about that the same university  if it is the right fit for Anna. On this note, May I know what exactly is the concern you have so that I can assist you in the better way?
18/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay thank you
18/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 747 0436: My concern is for my daughter to get quality education at affordable fee and achieve her goals
18/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, @263777470436. We, as your admissions team, wholeheartedly resonate with your perspective regarding Anna's education.

Rest assured that MVN University stands out as the best choice for her, combining top-tier education with affordability. What sets MVN apart is its commitment to providing a substantial quantum of scholarships. Due to this distinctive feature, MVN University is unparalleled in this regard, with no other university able to compete on the same level.
18/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The exclusivity and limited number of seats at MVN University have created a competitive environment, and hence students from all corners of the globe are striving to secure admission over there. Anna is one of the fortunate students to have secured this prestigious scholarship.

With that said, I would like to inquire if you are aware of how Anna was able to secure such a prestigious offer and how her admission process has been carried out?
18/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 747 0436: No you can share with us
18/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777470436. Let me help you with that, I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind for Anna's Education, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, her application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay
18/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Will be waiting
18/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I am not aware you can explain
18/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN Universitywithout risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/11/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN University, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Yes it's clear thank you for clarity
18/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777470436. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $425 , or you can opt to pay the full $850 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
18/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 747 0436: I will pay on payment plan $425 before 28November
18/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this @263777470436. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
18/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 747 0436: On the 24 November I will deposit Mr  Charles Jereras' Fbc account
18/11/23, 4:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
18/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 747 0436: Okay thank you
18/11/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome, Wish you a great weekend ahead and please extend our warm regards to your family and Anna. <This message was edited>

24/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anna, Wishing you a good day!

As per the discussion that we had here earlier, you were planning to make the payment of your registration fee by 24th November, however, I have not received an update from your side on that. 

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials? <This message was edited>
