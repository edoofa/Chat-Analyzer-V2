If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
23/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we can start
23/11/23, 4:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am done with the stages <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
23/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes they are clear
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l am
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes they are, so these stages will happen when the results are out or now
23/11/23, 5:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 Let me share that we will proceed with these stages from today itself, May I know if you are ready for the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office* ?
23/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes  am ready
23/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
23/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes let's move forward

23/11/23, 5:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 9:30 pm for our next session. I hope by then you will be able to go through all the videos. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
23/11/23, 5:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Enjoy the video @263785471606, you will get amazing insight from them
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 547 1606: For students to have a successful journey with Edoofa they must have 2 important qualities that is :
1. The student should be teachable and must be open minded
2. The students must follow Edoofa instructions
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263785471606, May I please know if you have completed the videos?
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Edoofa' s vision through the steels that's ( student of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success)is to increase the student's capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent for example if we put a cup and a huge tank in a sea they are going to hold different quantities of water because of the capacity, that is a cup is going to hold a small quantity than the tank
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Edoofa gas invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Statement of purpose is an important document, which students must fill in order to convince the admission board of universities
23/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l have completed
23/11/23, 9:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263785471606 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.

24/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 547 1606: 3 *. The understanding of GAAP and it's importance* ?
 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principle refers to a common set of accounting rules , standards and procedures issued by the financial Accounting Standards Board { FASB} . GAAP had got four basic principles that is costs , revenue recognition, matching and disclosure.

 *Cost principle* ~ refers to the fact that all listed values are accurate and reflect only actual costs , rather than any market value of thee cost items.

 *Revenue recognition principle* ~ when you are recording information about the business you need to consider the period of time when revenues are recognized through the income statement.

 *Matching principle* ~ expenses should be matched to revenues recognized in the same accounting period.

 *Full disclosure principle* ~ the information on financial statement should be completed so that nothing is misleading.

The importance of GAAP is to ensure a company's financial statements are complete , consistent and comparable. This makes it easier for investors to analyze and extract useful information from the company's financial statements and accurate cross - company comparison
GAAP compliant accountants strictly adhere to established rules and regulations. Consistent standards are applied throughout the financial reporting process and they are also committed to accuracy and impartiality 

In conclusion, GAAP helps govern the world of accounting according to general rules and guidelines. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to complete them and then we can start our today's session.
24/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 547 1606: *4. What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?* 

An accounting standard is a common set of standards, procedures, and principles that define the basis of financial accounting practices and policies. 

 They are used for accounting functions such as bookkeeping, determining estimates, preparing financial statements, and required note disclosures.

Accounting standards apply to all aspects of a business including assets, revenue, liabilities, expenses, and shareholders’ equity.

 Accounting standards are used to improve the transparency of financial reporting. They specify how and when economic events are to be measured, as well as recognized, and disclosed. 

These standards are also used by external entities like banks, investors, and regulatory agencies. They rely on accounting standards to make sure that they are receiving accurate and relevant information. 

Therefore, accounting standards work as a way to ensure transparency and comparability in financial reporting, as well as setting the boundaries for reporting measures.

Accounting standards ensure the financial statements from multiple companies are comparable. Because all entities follow the same rules, accounting standards make the financial statements credible and allow for more economic decisions based on accurate and consistent information.


In conclusion, accounting standards are a vital part of worldwide accounting. They help to bring consistency, as well as make documents easily comparable. They  allow investors to get a clear view on a business’s operations and make an informed decision.
24/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 May I please know how much time will it take dear to complete the document?
24/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 547 1606: *5. Differentiate between accounting and auditing?* 

 Accounting is the daily process of recording financial transactions, managing data, and maintaining records. Auditing is a periodic process that focuses on ensuring the accuracy and legality of financial statements. There are different types of accountants and different types of auditors.

 *Documentation* : Auditing typically only covers final financial statements. Accounting involves developing statements and current financial transactions.

 *Deliverables* : Accountants may deliver an income statement, balance sheet, or any other financial statements. Auditors only deliver an audit report.
Accounts: Accountants create financial accounts for a business. They work with accounts in progress at every stage of development. Auditors only work with final accounts.

 *Reporting* : Accountants report to their employers or clients. Auditors will submit their audit report to shareholders or legal entities.
Payment: Accountants are usually company employees who are paid with a regular salary. Companies will pay an auditor’s fee after they perform the audit from an external body. 

 *Scope* : The scope of accounting is determined by the clients or employer. The scope of auditing is determined by the law. 

 *Time* : Accounting is a continuous practice. Auditing is done on a periodic or as-needed basis. 
Objectivity and independence

In summation, accounting and auditing deliver related benefits in different ways. Both roles are vital to risk management, increased transparency, and data-driven decision making.
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am only left with SOP my network it's a bit slow  but in 45 minutes l think l will be done
24/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, in that case you can complete the form. In the meantime, Let's start our today's session.
24/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023).
24/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JxHS1kVkjw85FTNdEkyjaV
24/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Adonai Munkuli, and my EWYL group name is Adonai EWYL23E0947. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
24/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
24/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes it's very accurate
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Noted
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
24/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we discussed about it
24/11/23, 8:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we are
24/11/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
24/11/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
24/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l have
24/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
24/11/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
24/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay noted
24/11/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 547 1606: I don't have any queries
24/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
24/11/23, 9:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
24/11/23, 9:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Thank you
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263785471606, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
24/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Noted
24/11/23, 9:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
24/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Let's proceed
24/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
24/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
24/11/23, 9:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Ok
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 9:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
24/11/23, 9:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/11/23, 9:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Nothing
24/11/23, 9:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 547 1606: You may provide more information
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
24/11/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
24/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 547 1606: So what about if the student passes with flying colors the scholarship percentage will it increase
24/11/23, 10:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263785471606, In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
24/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 10:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
24/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes yes
24/11/23, 10:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
24/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay, however if the student does very well you can be able to change for him the course and do a better course which is more marketable
24/11/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, May I please know if you are asking this out of curiosity or you want to change your course?
24/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am asking out of curiosity because on social media l come across new courses  which l never knew that they do exist but currently am satisfied with my course which l chose
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I can understand that however I would like to mention that your course is also one of the best course, preferred by the edoofians.
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Everything is clear
24/11/23, 10:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263785471606,  So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/11/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l am
