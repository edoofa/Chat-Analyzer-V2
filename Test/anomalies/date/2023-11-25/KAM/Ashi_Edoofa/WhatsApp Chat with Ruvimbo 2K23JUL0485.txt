07/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am i remember it
07/09/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
07/09/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 156 4809: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
Thats all i remember
07/09/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
07/09/23, 11:05 pm - +263 78 156 4809: No ma'am
07/09/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?

08/09/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Evening ma'am,i will not be available on 2pm
08/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Am available on 8pm
09/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as I'm feeling a bit under the weather. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your family.
09/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok ma'am get well soon
I think our session should be held at 9 p.m
09/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Wishing you too a blessed weekend
11/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Hello ma'am
17/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruvimbo.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok ma'am
17/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Thank God you are now recovering we had been worried for you
21/09/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo.

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with receiving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
21/09/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok
25/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Hie ma'am
25/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruvimbo.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we were not available to connect so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am
25/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 156 4809: My mother is worried about my place
25/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do not worry, let us move forward with our discussions and you will be able to understand the process clearly.
25/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok ma'am
25/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 156 4809: I went through them ma'am
25/09/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Noted
25/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 7:40 am - +263 78 156 4809: so the reduced amount of money is only for the first year?
26/09/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so we could not get back to you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/09/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Good evening ma'am we have electricity problems this side
26/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable. I recognize that electricity issues can indeed be challenging plus I understand that you must be occupied with your work, and please know that we are here to support you patiently, even during such hurdles. 

May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Good evening ma'am am sorry we couldn't connect yesterday because of electricity,today we can connect
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for letting me know, and I'm glad to hear that you have electricity today and can connect. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
28/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am
28/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear here?
28/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am i am
28/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 7, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 7, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 7, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/09/23, 10:44 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Am following
28/09/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 156 4809: No questions
28/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as Ruvimbo's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Ruvimbo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am
28/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
28/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 156 4809: We are much more excited and looking forward to the next steps
28/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok
28/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see your enthusiasm. Have a great night.
28/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Thank you
02/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Hie ma'am
03/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruvimbo.

03/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Last time you said the offer letter from the University will be sent in 3 to 5 days but back then nothing was sent Soo I wanted to confirm
03/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

03/10/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok

I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I would love to do that please. Before that, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes sir
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 156 4809: We are well sir
06/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
06/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 156 4809: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?

-its 975
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?

-its 3years
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?

-200 

4. What’s the Registration fee?

700
06/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
06/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes sir
06/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Is registration fee among tuition fee??
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here, for now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from LPU?
09/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes sir
09/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
09/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
09/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok sir
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Let's move on
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok I think I will opt for off compus since it's much affordable,will I be living alone or with the others?
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes sir
09/10/23, 5:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
09/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes sir
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 18th October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 18th November 2023.* <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 5:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *18th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
09/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok but I looked on the offer letter and it's not written that supposed to start next year like I opted for August 2023
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 156 4809: And it's now confusing me and my family
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Is registration fee part of tuition fee??
09/10/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, let me help you in understanding the same here. Now, since your application was for a Diploma course, and it was processed while the intake was open, therefore, it was processed for the 2023 intake. However, you do not have to worry about that since, your application will be shifted to 2024 intake please. I hope this is clear?
09/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwes? Are you residing in Harare?
09/10/23, 11:06 pm - +263 78 156 4809: No,Gweru
09/10/23, 11:07 pm - +263 78 156 4809: The date on the Offer Letter already expired?
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, as I have already mentioned here, the deadline for you to make the payment of your registration fee as well as to secure your seat at the university is 18th October, hence, we are working according to the same please.
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok thank you but is there any other form of payment so that I can pay the money to the University straight because am working and I am not given off to go to Harare
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Good day sir I spoke with Mr Rajan so I will send my reg fee to him on Friday.
I wanted to know like my reg fee is 700 Soo does that mean that 150 had been removed now I have to pay 550 and I can pay that in two instalments 275 and the other 275 before 18th of November??
11/10/23, 11:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ruvimbo!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion.

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, Ruvimbo, can you please let me know of the reason that your mother is planning to make the payment at once, when you have the option to make it in two parts that would make it easier for you?
16/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 541 8321: Well for now things are a bit unstable sir so am asking if you could allow me to pay it at once before 18 November
16/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 541 8321: Is it ok if I pay the other half in November and half in December before 15 December??

19/10/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Ruvimbo, on that note, I would like to mention that 18th of October was yesterday please, therefore, I believe you do have a misunderstanding here, right?

19/10/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note Ruvimbo, I would like to mention that since the university has already given you the date of yesterday to move ahead and complete your registration process, in that case, extending that date by November would not be possible, since it would fall in the next cycle of admissions. 

Now, in that case, what we can do is that we can pay some part of the registration fee in this month to secure the scholarship seat and then pay the remaining in the coming month please. Therefore, can you please help me in understanding about the same that how much can you manage to raise for your registration fee in this month so that we can plan the next steps accordingly?

19/10/23, 9:23 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, Ruvimbo, I would be more than happy to discuss the same with the university officials please, however, for me to be able to do that, you would first have to be certain about the same that you would surely be able to make the payment before this month end. Hence, can you please let me know of the same after discussing it with your mother dear?
19/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 156 4809: Ok sir thank you Soo much
19/10/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, by when do you think you would be able to have a discussion with your mother and let me know of the same dear?

19/10/23, 9:29 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, would you be able to give me an update by tomorrow afternoon?

Now, on that note, I would like to mention that since the university had already shared the deadlines with you for making the payment of the registration fee, on that note, do you think that if it would be possible for you to clear the same by the mentioned deadline itself?
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. Now, this registration fee that you will pay will get adjusted in the first year fee only. Which means that in the following years, you would have to pay the complete tuition fee please. <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

24/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvimbo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I was recently reviewing your Scholarship Application File, and I observed that you have secured your scholarship seat with LPU University by paying your first part of the your registration fees which is $310, and the remaining amount for the same fee which is $301 is due. 

Hence, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity? Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $301 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?
24/11/23, 11:43 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok ma'am

How are you?? 

We are fine this side
24/11/23, 11:44 pm - +263 78 156 4809: We're hoping by end of this month we will have the payment done.
24/11/23, 11:44 pm - +263 78 156 4809: I wanted to ask if the mistake on the offer letter was corrected?
