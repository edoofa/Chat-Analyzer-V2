21/10/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

23/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263786776631May I know if you have gone through my above message?
23/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Oooh yes very sorry l was kinda occupied
23/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No issues @263786776631, I can truly understand that you are occupied with something.
23/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are eagerly waiting for your response.
23/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 677 6631: So should l share my understandings per each video ?
23/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 677 6631: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 677 6631: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 677 6631: For a student to have a successful journey with Edoofa :the student should be teachable and open minded 
They should also follow instructions
23/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 677 6631: In this video they went on further on highlighting that the Edoofa programme doesn't only make quality education affordable and students employable through the SEELS program but it also imparts a sense of responsibility and independence
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Talent, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 677 6631: In this video l understood that Edoofa has invested over ten years to pick out/ identify the best schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians.They encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for those prestigious institutions
23/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 677 6631: In this video they highlight the importance Statement Of Purpose (SOP) and that that students should diligence in filling out the document
23/10/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/10/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes l totally agree with you and that's what l understood from the videos as well
23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant @263786776631. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:00 AM.
23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

23/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
23/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have taken a note of above messages.
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I will definitely submit the completed tasks by 10:00am tomorrow
23/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 677 6631: No problem I'll definitely share the screenshot after l'm done
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I have acknowledge all the above messages
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263786776631 I am happy to see that you have taken a note of the messages.
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
25/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 677 6631: Oooh 😅Thank you for the clarification.
25/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: No issues @263786776631, you are always welcome.
25/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/10/23, 11:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 11:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 11:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 677 6631: Yes it's really not practical
25/10/23, 11:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 677 6631: Yes we have discussed about the registration fee
25/10/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 677 6631: Yes we're definitely ok the same page
25/10/23, 11:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 11:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
25/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 677 6631: Yes l have
25/10/23, 12:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 12:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay l understand
25/10/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I understand
25/10/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 677 6631: My counselor told me that Edoofa would assist me in getting my student's visa
25/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Could you please tell me what was meant by that because l thought that meant Edoofa was going to process all my travelling documents
25/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263786776631You are absolutely right, we will assist you in obtaining the Student Visa when your arrival date will ne near. All the documents and queries will be attended by us for your Visa, Kindly don't worry your Visa process will start at the right time.
25/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then thank you for clarifying that for me
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, you are welcome. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/10/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have taken a note of the above messages.
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263786776631, We are always prepare for our Edoofians. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes lm clear
25/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes l understand
25/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 677 6631: No l don't have any queries l understand all of the above
25/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263786776631. So, are you excited to initiate the process?

Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes lm so excited

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 378 9929: Certainly we are ready
15/11/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 378 9929: I will be coming online here and there I'm still at work so I'm might not available to answer some of the questions. But Talent will be available I will be reading all the  messages if I any question I will be asking.i hope you will understand
15/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263773789929, We do understand that you are occupied with your schedule however I really appreciate your efforts towards Talent's journey. On this note, I would like to ask where is Talent?
15/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 378 9929: We are in different location maybe network challenge let me phone him
15/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We can understand that the network challenges are beyond our control. I am looking forward to connect with Talent
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Im sorry for not responding l was having network difficulties but l'm here now
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Could you please share your response?
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Fee per semester is $900
The standard duration is 3years
The admission and procedure fee$300
The registration fee is $750
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes it does and thank you for the clarification
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then l understand but l was under the impression that the university was going to provide accomodation
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yeah
15/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 677 6631: This definitely clears it up
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes l'm clear with this
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Wow thats great news actually
15/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes we're clear
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes could you kindly explain
15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes I understand
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 677 6631: No we reside in Kwekwe
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Sure thing thank you
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then it's all clear
15/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Thank you
15/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then 2800 would be the total annual fee
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 677 6631: So the credit points would pay for my accommodation as well?
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263786776631 Mainly the EWYL Credits are used to pay for your tuition fees, although after paying your tuition fees your credits are left then we can surely work with the team to use them for your accommodation. I hope that's clear. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes this is crystal clear
15/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents.
15/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Talent, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to your last conversation, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
16/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Good afternoon to you too and yes I'm available to engage with you
16/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263786776631, It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I have no inquiries as of now so we may proceed
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

As the university has set a deadline of November 28th, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from.
