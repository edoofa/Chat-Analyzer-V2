I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 376 4957: We are ready
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Let's start
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 376 4957: I have seen the images..and i noticed we are supposed to go through 6 processes of which you are yet to take us through..
29/09/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/09/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Yes..very clear
29/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 376 4957: I am following..
29/09/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/09/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Yes they are clear..especially on step 5...we have to start preparing ..
29/09/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
29/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Is it possible if we may know when the programmes will start for next year..so that we prepare just in case we win..and if its possible they might be a chance of   a seat available for his course any time soon .
29/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773764957 I can see that you are enthusiastic about Adrian's higher education however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
29/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Yes ..we are clear..we can move forward
29/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Yes...lets start
29/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
29/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
29/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 376 4957: Please share
29/09/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

03/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 912 6850: From the videos i have learmt that students should be teachable, open minded and be able to follow instructions, ad that the student should understand that Edoofa has invested alot of time in identifying good shools,colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians thus founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions not forgetting that the Edoofian vision that is not to just get affordable and quality education and promoting employment trhough the SEELS program ,but it is  also forcused on increasing students capacity for success,thus making students more responsible and independent and lastly the statement of purpose  is an important document that students should be prompt in taking action, and be diligent in filling out the form
03/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Adrian.

I hope you are in good health. I apologize for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday, which made it impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available to connect?
03/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted.  We are available
03/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
03/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess we did
03/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Yes we are on the same page
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before concluding our conversation for today I would like to share your EWYL group 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/GTHjq5W5nMYGy4Mg2BE4LI

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Nyoni Adrian Nkosana, and my EWYL group name is Adrian EWYL23E0744. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 06/10/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
03/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _ and he/she has scheduled my session for __*(mention the date)
04/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 912 6850: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 912 6850: 2.My favorite artist is Sir Roger A. Deakins a cinematographer is my role model as we have a lot in common ,he does not treat photography like a job but values it greatly and is very straightforward as he says “My process is pretty straight forward” telling PetaPixel a photography news site that covers photo and camera news,reviews,inspiration and education .He enjoys walking and exploring new and familiar places where he spends hours observing an image without shooting a single frae  which shows that photography is not something to just analyse and shoot an image but the heart and mind to find perfect and well deserving shots  is what produces a perfect photograph not forgetting that Deakins is widely considered to be one of the greatest cinematographers of all time with two Academy Awards and sixteen nominations for his cinematography of over seventy feature films.
3.In terms of books I enjoy reading more of literature based ones for example novels and poetry as they are a work of imagination characterised by excellence of style and expression and by themes of general or enduring interest as these authors write about what they come across in their daily lives worldwide thus giving me a broad mindset and very creative one as I learn about a lot of different cultures and the way some people live.
4.One of the best nuance I love in film making is emotional nuance for example in the movie FIREWORKS WEDNESDAY by Asghar Farhadi. Farhadi is brilliant at revealing what is buried beneath the surface in his characters. He peels it all back layer after layer, bit by bit, moment by moment, scene by scene. Every film of his tears every viewer up with the pains of the characters. I marvel at how he achieves this with so little dialogue and very precisely staged moments.He will show a character alone in a room and we will know the pain or confusion that person is feeling.
5.My best pieces of work at the moment are just simple shots of flowers, the sunset, wild life and sunrise.
05/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Adrian.

05/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure let me help you understand, by financial preparation, you would need to explain how well you and your family and mentally and financially prepared for your higher education. 

I hope we are clear now?
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess  we are thank you
05/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 912 6850: What do i write on long term and short term goals
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789126850 here you would have to think and mention what are your goals 5 years down the lane, and what are your short term goals like maybe getting good grades in A- level.
05/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Ohh okay thank you

05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Okay thank you so much
05/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 912 6850: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Fine arts for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yes
05/10/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 912 6850: So am i going to be corrected in what i wrote to make my SOP perfect ❓
05/10/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If needed, we will improve your SOP so that your application gets accepted in more universities.
05/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 912 6850: What exactly will we be doing
05/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will now be moving to the Step 3 of your admission cycle please.
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i am
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yes i do
05/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess he has
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess
05/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i have
06/10/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Adrian.

I hope this message finds you well, By the time you responded it was almost past our available working hours, so we did not get back to you since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Yes we are available to continue now
06/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that may I know if you were able to take note of the above example of the fee breakup?
06/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess
06/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess we have
06/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
06/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 226 6302: May l please know about the monthly installments   l mean the flexibility to manage students of their finances effectively
06/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772266302 please understand that this is just a cost breakdown, and once we move ahead with the process each and every thing will be cleared with the explanations itself. 

I hope we are clear now?
06/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Thats good
06/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 912 6850: No
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789126850 @263772266302 I was hoping that you would respond and acknowledge the message, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
07/10/23, 8:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Adrian.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message?
07/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 226 6302: All is clear,  we are now looking forward to the step 4
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

07/10/23, 8:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 226 6302: We have reviewed the benefits
07/10/23, 10:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/10/23, 10:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Adrian's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/10/23, 10:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263772266302 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Thats good
09/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Adrian.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i am
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now moving ahead with the next point.

*2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess it does
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yes
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 912 6850: No i am following perfectly
09/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 912 6850: I would like more information
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 912 6850: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 912 6850: I have 8 points in total
09/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yes i have
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your A-level results. I empathize with the fact that students may occasionally find themselves in a state of uncertainty or confusion. However, considering that you currently have your examination results with you, it's worth highlighting that the first four advantages mentioned earlier are particularly pertinent and relevant to you. I hope you are clear here?
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i am
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Ohh i wanted to verify if my documents have already been sent to universities or they are still being evaluated
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, we will now be sharing your application with the universities. May I know if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 912 6850: No i do not
09/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
09/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i am
09/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 912 6850: So i we are  working on getting me in one of the 63 positions left ❓
09/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Okay thank you
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
09/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 912 6850: So our next session is in 3 to 5 days or we continue as usual
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, now we are waiting for the university to generate the offer letter, and once we receive the letter we shall update you and share it with you soon.
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Ohh okay thank you once again
14/10/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Adrian.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by PDM University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:54 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 226 6302: Thank you for the scholarship offer
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and ADrian!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Yes we have gone through the offer later. We are having challenges with network problems but l am back online
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 226 6302: 1, $ 1165  2, $ 1250  3, $ 750
14/10/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1165 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1165 +$1250 = $2415. I hope you are clear about this?
14/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted.  It's very clear
14/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
14/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1165 + $1000) = $2165. Are you clear with this as well?
14/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
14/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted
14/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
14/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
14/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 912 6850: Yess i am
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Adrian!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2165 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2165 - $1000 = $1165 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
15/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted
15/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
15/10/23, 9:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1165  - $750 = $415 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1165 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2415 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665 which can be paid in two installments of $833 & $832. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
15/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Yes l am following
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 226 6302: All is clear,  how do l payments when l am in Zimbabwe.  The last time we made a payment through FBC Bank Mutare, Zimbabwe
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 226 6302: I am residing in Bulawayo
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 226 6302: Noted
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 4:30 am - +263 77 226 6302: Yes you may share the account details. I am looking at another alternative helping students process payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate, if l may have contact details
16/10/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 226 6302: My apologies,  l mean cellphone number
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Adrian!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I have already shared the contact of Mr. Rajan with you here, may I know if you were able to take note of the same so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
16/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 912 6850: Morning
16/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Adrian, may you please let me know of this as well dear.

17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
17/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 226 6302: I don't have  queries at the moment, l will come back to you if something comes up
