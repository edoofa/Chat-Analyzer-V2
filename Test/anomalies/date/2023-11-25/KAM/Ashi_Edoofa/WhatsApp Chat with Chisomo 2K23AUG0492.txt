17/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/08/23, 12:56 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Will can start
17/08/23, 12:56 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: We*
17/08/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 12:59 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Done you can now explain it to me
17/08/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/08/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
17/08/23, 1:03 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes are clear
17/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/08/23, 1:05 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes am following
17/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/08/23, 1:07 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes the are
17/08/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/08/23, 1:10 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/08/23, 2:04 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Am done watching the videos
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: And here i don't get the first question
17/08/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by today 09.00 pm?
17/08/23, 3:01 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
17/08/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that, let me correct this, you would have to share your MSCE Result, JCE Results, and your Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
17/08/23, 3:05 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky but for the JCE i don't have because when i was in form two at that time the  was no JCE i only have the MSCE.
17/08/23, 3:06 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: So where do i get the answer paper for this questions ?
17/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know the same. In that case, may I suggest you please request a letter from the school about the same, stating that by your time JCE was removed and you have passed the equivalent examination that was held in place of JCE. 

I hope we are clear?
17/08/23, 3:09 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Ok
17/08/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You do not need an answer paper for these interview questions, you can answer these questions by text and share them here through this platform, I hope we are clear?
17/08/23, 3:10 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes madam
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if by tomorrow 01.00 pm you will be able to share the letter from the school regarding the JCE result?

18/08/23, 9:41 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:41 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes i have done it
18/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
18/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
18/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Business Administration, for your higher education in India as per the August 2023 intake?
18/08/23, 9:45 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: No am going for the intake of 2024 not this year
18/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, as per the records from the counseling team and as per the counseling feedback form which was filled out by you, it clearly stated that your year of intake is August 2023, may I know what changed and why are you more inclined towards 2024 intake now?
18/08/23, 9:51 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes at first it was like that i wanted the intake of 2023 but because of some financial issues that is why i changed to 2024
18/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, thank you for letting me know that, I understand, in that case, could you please update the counseling feedback form with the same?
18/08/23, 9:56 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky
18/08/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, to be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Business Administration, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
18/08/23, 9:58 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
18/08/23, 9:59 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for updating the form, *Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
18/08/23, 10:00 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes i am
18/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
18/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
18/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
18/08/23, 10:04 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes he did
18/08/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1250-$1500 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
18/08/23, 10:08 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
18/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
18/08/23, 10:11 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes it is
18/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 10:16 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes am following
18/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
18/08/23, 10:19 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Nop
18/08/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now Chisomo, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
18/08/23, 10:21 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Sure madam
18/08/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night and weekend ahead.

10/10/23, 9:37 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: What i remember is that we stopped on the stage 3 you correct me if am wrong
10/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct, may I know if you recall anything about the counseling on the admission process and the registration fee?
10/10/23, 9:43 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: To be honest i for got on that part
10/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
10/10/23, 9:47 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes am ready
10/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
10/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $1000, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here? <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 9:51 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes mam i now  recall  everything
10/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $1250 to $1500, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $1350 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $1350 - $1000 = $350. You can pay this due within the first three days of your arrival in India.
10/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
10/10/23, 10:17 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: I understand everything here so my  question is when school are in long team holiday  so what happens to the students that come from other countries like me do the need to go back home and come after holiday ? how do things go there
10/10/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265996651353 I would have loved to continue and answer your query however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
10/10/23, 10:22 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky thank you bye
10/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night, let us reconnect tomorrow.

11/10/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chisomo.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, since we were unable to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

11/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now let me help you understand your query from yesterday, @265996651353 when the semester break is going on it's totally the student's wish if they want to stay and explore more in India, or if they wish to go back for a short time. Most of the students prefer to stay work on projects, focus on the EWYL program and explore India. 

I hope your concern has been answered here?
11/10/23, 12:33 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Ooooh that is nice so where do they stay if they choose to stay back not going back home for the holiday ?
11/10/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Wherever the student has chosen their accommodation please @265996651353 I would encourage you to be a little patient as we move ahead with our discussions every query of yours will be covered.
11/10/23, 12:37 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky mah

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth.

11/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @265996651353 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Wow i get it here
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes mah
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes mah i get it
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 1:28 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Mah is that for me to be  part of the Endowment i have to pay $150 is that you nean ?
11/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265996651353 the registration fee as discussed above is $750 and through the Endowment program Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf and you will only be required to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the University which you can pay in two installments of $300 each.
11/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Also, please understand that this registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Ooooh now i understand thank you mah will can continue
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 1:35 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: No mah i don't have
11/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 1:37 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes mam i am
11/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Thank you very much Miss Kirti for you time you too have  a blessed day
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, and a great day to you too.
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chisomo.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chisomo!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 11:55 am - +265 996 65 13 53: Good afternoon
Yes i was able to go through it
15/10/23, 11:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 12:04 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: The tuition fee is $900
The standard duration of my course is 3 years from 2024 to 2027 in july 
The admission fee is $300
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, can you please also share your answer to question number four please.
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Its $300
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oooh sorry how you feeling good now
15/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I am feeling good now, thanks ☺️!
15/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Chisomo, here, please go about the question number 3 and 4 dear, they are different. And then let me know of the fourth one.
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: That is good news
15/10/23, 9:29 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Then i think i miss the number 4 one
15/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. May you also go through the letter again and then let me know of the same.
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: I think the registration fee is the same as admission its just that this things are the same
15/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, they are not the same. For that, read the offer letter properly and you will get to know, and then you can share your answer here again.
15/10/23, 9:55 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: $750
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:11 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes i get it too there
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:17 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes we are together
15/10/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 5:25 am - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes i get it here
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents Chisomo!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 11:31 am - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
16/10/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 11:50 am - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes sir
16/10/23, 12:03 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the same please. Now, The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 2:50 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Sir on the tuition fee must it not be 150 + 900 which is making $1050 ?
16/10/23, 2:53 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: And on the accommodation for first year i will be in campus which $2000
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know which $150 are you adding here dear?
16/10/23, 2:55 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: 👆
16/10/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I believe you have misunderstood the same dear. Hence, can you please share your understanding of that again.
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: You said the part of the registration fee will adjust to my first year fee thereby  from the  $900 i have to pay $150 which is the  balance i will pay after arriving in india
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you in getting clarity on that Chisomo. Since your total per semester fee is $900, now once you would have paid the registration fee, it will then be subtracted from the first semester fee which means that the balance that would remain is:

$900 - $750 = $150
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope this is clear now?
16/10/23, 3:59 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Ooooh oky oky
16/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the same dear?
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yeah
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chisomo!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/10/23, 2:25 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: No
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

17/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?

In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer. <This message was edited>
