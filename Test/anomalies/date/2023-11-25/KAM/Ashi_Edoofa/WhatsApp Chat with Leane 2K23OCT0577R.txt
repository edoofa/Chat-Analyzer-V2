14/10/23, 9:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 720 5067: I'm done
14/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
14/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
14/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
14/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 720 5067: Yes thy are
14/10/23, 9:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/10/23, 9:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
14/10/23, 9:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
14/10/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I am
14/10/23, 9:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
14/10/23, 9:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/10/23, 9:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
14/10/23, 9:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

14/10/23, 9:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, we have gone through all 6 steps. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

14/10/23, 9:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/10/23, 9:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
14/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Well I  understood that the Edoofa scholarship program is they to help students get affordable education and have a wide range of opportunities. I also got the fact that the Edoofa program is in contact with the some of the best universities that  also help students in achieving thier goals and dreams. Also for one to be a successful Edoofian they must have the 2 important qualities which include following instructions and being open minded
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Leane, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
14/10/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I was
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

17/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 720 5067: 2 the difference between rights and duties and also civil rights and human rights 

The difference between rights and duties is that rights are things that we are entitled to, while duties are things that we are obligated to do. For example, we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but we also have a duty to respect the rights of others and to obey the law. In general, rights are about what we can do, while duties are about what we should do. Another way to think about it is that rights are about freedom, while duties are about responsibility. To further explain the main difference between civil rights and human rights is that civil rights are legal protections that are guaranteed by a government or legal system, while human rights are fundamental rights that are inherent to all people, regardless of their nationality or legal status. For example, civil rights in the United States include things like the right to vote and the right to a fair trial, while human rights include things like the right to life and the right to be free from torture. Another way to think about it is that civil rights are specific to a particular country or legal system, while human rights are universal.
17/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 720 5067: The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney 


A prosecutor, is a legal professional who brings criminal charges against a person accused of a crime, while an attorney is a broader term that refers to any legal professional who provides legal advice or representation. Put simply, all prosecutors are attorneys, but not all attorneys are prosecutors. A prosecutor is a type of attorney who specializes in prosecuting criminal cases, while other types of attorneys, such as defense attorneys or civil attorneys, specialize in other areas of law.   One key difference between a persecutor and attorney is their role in the legal system. A prosecutor is responsible for bringing charges against someone accused of a crime, and their goal is to prove that the accused is guilty. An attorney, on the other hand, can be either a prosecutor or a defense attorney, and their role is to provide legal representation to their client. Another key difference is that prosecutors work for the government, while attorneys can work for either the government or for private clients.
17/10/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 720 5067: My skills

There are many skills that I possess in order to be become a successful lawyer. For example, communication skills are vital for effective advocacy  and also a  important skill fit one to a successful lawyer. Critical thinking  is also one of the skills I have. This is important for analyzing complex legal issues and developing persuasive arguments. Writing skills are necessary and also part of my skill set as it helps drafting legal documents, such as briefs and contracts. I'm also have  research skills which are  essential for staying up-to-date on the latest legal developments and for locating relevant case law and statutes. These are my skill set that I believe will make me a great lawyer
17/10/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 720 5067: Why  I want to study criminal law 


Law has always fascinated me by Criminal law has always been my favourite. Criminal law is the branch of law that deals with crimes and the punishment of criminals. The main goal of criminal law is to deter crime and keep society safe by punishing those who break the law. The reason why i want to study criminal law, including gaining a deeper understanding of how the justice system works, learning about the rights of both victims and offenders, and developing skills in critical thinking and problem-solving. I would also like to get justice for those that are unable to do it them themselves

17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (20th October).
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do: 
https://chat.whatsapp.com/DzmaLfXXgwpHMJ7fEyPzRN
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Leane Ruvarashe Mapfumo, and my EWYL group name is Leane EWYL23E0783. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Do let me know once you have taken a note of the above information.
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes
17/10/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 720 5067: I have
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes that is correct
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
17/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I do
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
17/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes they have
17/10/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes we are
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I have
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 720 5067: The 750 Is the one that u said the scholarship will cover do I have that correct
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand @263777205067, $750 amount is needed for the registration process which is paid by you once you receive your offer letter, However this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - +27 64 199 1065: Ms Ashi is this registration fee needed after her A level results or before what about if she failed her A level
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky is this money paid after my a level results are out
17/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Leane, Your doubts will be cleared as we move forward with the discussion. Please be assured that your concern will be assisted soon. On this note May I kindly know if we can move ahead with the discussion?
17/10/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777205067 , let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes we are
17/10/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes
17/10/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I do
17/10/23, 6:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
17/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky
17/10/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes we are
17/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yex we are
17/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point.
17/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
17/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky I understand
17/10/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 720 5067: No I don't
17/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263777205067 in that case, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes I am very excited
17/10/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky thank you
17/10/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, please remember to share your O Level results tomorrow, as we need the document for your application.
17/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky I will do so
17/10/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

15/11/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 720 5067: 1) 350 us
2) 0 us
3) 5550
4) 250 us
5) 1000 us
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you dear regarding your annual fees at MVN University after scholarship is $1600. I hope that's clear.
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes it is
15/11/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation Leane. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes it is
15/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes  it does <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky i would like to know more about the Admission and Processing Fee
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes is though i would like to know more about the Admission and Processing Fee
15/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777205067, We wish surely attend your queries at the end. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 7:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents.
15/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes it does
15/11/23, 7:39 pm - +27 64 199 1065: Yaa I'm so impressed
15/11/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes i do
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason your per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Name’s first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes it does
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 720 5067: When is this amount expected to be paid
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777205067 We will soon discuss about the deadline. In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 720 5067: I think me and my family will. Have to think about it and do more research on the university
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777205067 It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes i do
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes we are
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes please
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023*  (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes it is
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky thank you
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Oky ma'am i will do so
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Though me and my family still want to research about the uni after that we will ger back to you
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes please
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738

15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 720 5067: No queries so far

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion previously, I'd like to inquire if you had the opportunity to have a discussion about the offer letter with your family?
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Good afternoon Ms Ashi
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Before we begin i have a question
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, please go ahead with your query
20/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 720 5067: I would like know. Wat happens if a student decides to pull out of the scholarship after paying the admission fee
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 720 5067: I you there Ms Ashi
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query Leanne, I understand the concern you have. However, you know that the students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program have made a firm commitment to pursue their education abroad. Withdrawal from the application is uncommon once the admission fee is paid, as the students are dedicated to advancing their studies.

Given your question, I am interested in understanding the specific circumstances or concerns that led to this inquiry. What reasons or scenarios do you have in mind that might lead a student to consider withdrawing? Your insights will help us address any potential challenges or uncertainties you may have.
20/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 720 5067: In the case that a student cant pay the other amount which is the Admission and Processing Fee and decide to take a gape year and apply at a later date
20/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777205067 , are you referring to the $1000 Admission and Processing Fee mentioned in your offer letter, which is required to secure your scholarship seat with the university? If not, could you please provide more details or clarify which specific fee you are referring to? This will help me better understand your situation and provide you with the relevant information.
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Yes the $1000  fee
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leane, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for providing the same clarity Leane and I appreciate your diligence in understanding more about the admission and processing fee.

To address your concern. Once a student enrolls under the Edoofa Program by paying their enrollment fee, it signifies a commitment to securing their scholarship seat with the university, and based on the same commitment, the admission process commences and with the assistance of Edoofa, the student can successfully obtain a scholarship offer. Therefore, withdrawing or taking a gap from this stage would not be possible.
21/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, I sense there might be more to your question. If you're facing challenges related to the payment of the $1000 fee, I would appreciate your honesty in sharing the specific concerns you have. 

It is crucial for us to understand your situation comprehensively, and we are here to explore possible solutions or alternatives to the challenges you are facing.
21/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 720 5067: Good afternoon
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 720 5067: So you mean i cant pull out of the scholarship after paying the admission fee even if im not able to pay the other amount
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that circumstances can change, and financial challenges may arise unexpectedly. However, once the enrollment fee is paid and the admission process is initiated, it is not possible to withdraw from the scholarship application process. The admission process involves securing your scholarship seat with the university, and at that point, the university allocates resources and makes arrangements for your enrollment.

From what I understand from your messages is that Leane, you wish to withdraw from your program because you feel as if you would not be able to raise the $1000 to lock your scholarship seat with the university. Is my understanding correct here?
