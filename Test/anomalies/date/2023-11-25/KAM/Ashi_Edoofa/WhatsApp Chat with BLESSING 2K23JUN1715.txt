09/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
17/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 351 6444: Good evening Ms Kirti and I hope you are fine

18/09/23, 5:03 am - +263 77 533 3163: Good morning Kirti how are you doing today
18/09/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can proceed with the admission process?
18/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yah lm ready
18/09/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 130 5452: You said that the admission fee is $ 750 and it's depends on university accepted my application form
18/09/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263771305452 you are correct. I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 130 5452: I have no qeries
18/09/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
18/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes lm ready ma'am
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/09/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
18/09/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/09/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/09/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/09/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted
18/09/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/09/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
18/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok ma'am
18/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok ma'am
18/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 130 5452: So do you want me to drop my o level results and statement of entry
18/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263771305452 you have already shared them with us, please do not worry.

2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 130 5452: August 2024
18/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand you well here, could you please help me understand?
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 130 5452: That's my intended year of entry
18/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed, 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Can explain again ma'am
18/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me explain, after receiving the offer letter, the $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee.

The reason behind this adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750.

I hope we are clear here?
18/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yah we are clear
18/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok we are clear ma'am
18/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes ma'am you can
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
18/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
18/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes l agree
18/09/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yah we are clear
18/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes we're clear
18/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/09/23, 11:11 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
18/09/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/09/23, 7:24 am - +263 77 130 5452: No l have no queries
19/09/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.

19/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok ma'am
19/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 130 5452: I have no queries
19/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now as Blessing's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Blessing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes lm
19/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted ma'am
19/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.

24/09/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
24/09/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
24/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 130 5452: I have finished
24/09/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, if you may also answer the queries that I have shared here dear.
24/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 130 5452: 1. Ser semester tuition fee 1800 usd
2 . The standard duration of the course 3 years
3. The admission and procedure fee ( one time payable) 300usd
4. Registration fee 100usd
24/09/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Blessing, please revisit the letter once and then share your answer to the question number one again dear.
24/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 130 5452: 1. Semester tuition fee 900 usd
24/09/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
24/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 533 3163: Good evening
We have a big challenge of network here in Zimbabwe
24/09/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Now, may I know if you are clear till here?
24/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yah we are clear
24/09/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
24/09/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
24/09/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
24/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted
26/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yes we are together
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 533 3163: Good morning Milian Singh
27/09/23, 11:34 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here as well please so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
27/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 130 5452: Yeah we can move ahead
27/09/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok sir noted
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yeah we are clear
28/09/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 130 5452: Nope lm in masvingo
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted sir
29/09/23, 5:43 am - +263 77 533 3163: Good morning Milian Singh I hope I found you well
Can I ask you something about paying our fee

Harare is too far for us to got there so is it impossible to use the account we use last time of Mr Charles Jerera
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
29/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 130 5452: Yes you should
29/09/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
29/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted sir
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
29/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted sir
29/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
29/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
29/09/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted sir
29/09/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 533 3163: Thank you
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
30/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Ok noted
01/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 533 3163: Good evening Millan Singh

02/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 130 5452: I think they have forgotten it

It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness.

23/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you at the earliest, however I am here to assist you. Let me help you here in understanding  -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Are you clear on this?
24/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 130 5452: Yah we are clear sir
24/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263771305452
