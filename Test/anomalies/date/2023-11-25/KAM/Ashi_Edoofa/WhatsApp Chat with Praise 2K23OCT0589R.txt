If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 73 331 0398: Yes, I am ready we can proceed
19/10/23, 10:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 73 331 0398: Done
19/10/23, 11:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/10/23, 11:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/10/23, 11:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/10/23, 11:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 73 331 0398: Very clear
19/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/10/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 73 331 0398: Sure
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 73 331 0398: Shed more light on the payment issue , should we pay the registration fee and visa process
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Or maybe my question is not clear, for example our registration fee is$1000 , are we paying $2000
19/10/23, 12:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me clear your doubt @263733310398. You only need to pay registration after you finalize your University and the Visa fee will be paid during your Visa process. For now, you don't have to pay any fees, I hope I am clear.
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Its clear now, many thanks
19/10/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263733310398 May I know if you have gone through my message, kindly do let me know.
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Good afternoon, I am sorry for late response I was in a meeting. We can proceed.
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263733310398
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Yes , we can proceed
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263733310398. I am sharing all the videos with you and I am sure you are excited for the same.

19/10/23, 2:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Praise, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 73 331 0398: I will go through the videos today after 5pm when I am through with work. So for the next session we can continue tomorrow

I hope by then you will be able to complete all the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you, same to you
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you so much @263733310398
20/10/23, 9:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Praise, Wishing you all a Wonderful day!

As we move forward with your journey, I would like to follow up on the videos we shared with you. Can you please confirm if you have watched the videos?
If you have watched the videos, please share your understanding and insights with us.
20/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 73 331 0398: Good morning @919650537098 I watched the 4 videos yesterday and the information was very inspiring and influencing to know more. I understood that with Edoofa scholarship it helps the student not to just to be away from home country but it boosts confidence of the student, help the student to identify opportunities and to be someone who is open - minded. The sky is the limit when you enrolled with Eddofa. However as a student he/she should be teachable and always follow instructions, be responsible and also show his/her skills and strength during the program
20/10/23, 10:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: YesPraise , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 73 331 0398: Yes I have understood
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/10/23, 10:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: I completely understand your tight schedule this weekend @263733310398. However, It's important to ensure that your EWYL session on Tuesday goes smoothly. I strongly encourage you to complete the forms by tomorrow morning. This will not only allow you to start your EWYL on the right track but also ensure that all the necessary preparations are in place. May I know if this is possible?
20/10/23, 10:37 am - +263 73 331 0398: I am a bit tied up and the least I can stretch will be Sunday around 5pm
20/10/23, 10:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263733310398 in that case I'll suggest you to complete the SOP form and Academic documents by Sunday and we'll reconnect on Monday at 09:00am. I hope that's okay.
20/10/23, 10:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
20/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 73 331 0398: To be frank I am currently at work and I have deadlines to meet and @263712871648  is currently attending workshop which will end on tomorrow at 6pm in a different city. So I am trying to squeeze my work schedule and my daughter at the same time. Maybe we can work with Sunday @1pm. Hoping that time @Mateo  2  will be available to take over
20/10/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you have a lot on your plate right now, and I appreciate your dedication to your work @263733310398. Given the circumstances, I'd like to schedule our next session on Monday at 9:00 am. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can confirm our meeting for Monday.
20/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you @919650537098 for your understanding . I really appreciate

20/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 73 331 0398: Ok, will try to get the document from the Head and will advise the position
20/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263733310398 In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the SOP form and academic documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

23/10/23, 8:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Praise, I hope you had a great weekend. 

Kindly excuse me for not responding to your message yesterday as we had a long weekend. However, I am glad to see that you have completed all the activities given to you, also I can totally understand your challenges due to no power and no internet. @263733310398 Could you please check if the Statement of Entry is shared by you, as we haven't received your response for the same.
23/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 73 331 0398: Good morning @919650537098 , our weekend was well. For the statement of entry we did not submit since we are still waiting for the response from the school head
23/10/23, 8:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263733310398, please make sure to share your Statement of entry with us once you successfully obtain it from th school.
23/10/23, 8:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (24-Oct-2023).
23/10/23, 8:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/KlMcdDQkWvk9SPCVefKoe7
23/10/23, 8:44 am - +263 73 331 0398: Noted will advise
23/10/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Praise Nyasha Mateo, and my EWYL group name is Praise EWYL23E0804. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
23/10/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
23/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Good afternoon 
I have send the message to them awaiting their response
23/10/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263733310398.
23/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you @919650537098 the program I have selected is "BCom in Accounting" and I am planning to arrive in India in August 2024
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome and Thank you so much for the confirmation @263733310398
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Quite inspiring indeed. It's our desire for our daughter to be part of a well organised scholarship institution which emphasise on quality of service. This would ensure a seamless process towards the achievement of her career objectives.
25/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you very much
25/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 73 331 0398: Please shed more light on this
25/10/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 73 331 0398: Well understood
25/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 73 331 0398: Please clarify here, the minimum points is it 2 "E grade" or 6 points?
25/10/23, 11:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263733310398 Both of them are relevant as 2 E Grades are equal to 6 points. I hope you understand.
25/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 73 331 0398: ok clear now
25/10/23, 11:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263733310398. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 73 331 0398: Yes, I agree
25/10/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Very clear
25/10/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 73 331 0398: So for this option is the scholarship option still applies
25/10/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263733310398. Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 73 331 0398: No questions
25/10/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263733310398 for sharing an update with us. Once we received the docuement then with your approval, we will proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

25/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you, we will ask if they are any grey areas
25/10/23, 3:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263733310398, I'll be waiting for the document. Have a great day ahead!
25/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Thank you

26/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 73 331 0398: Waiting for this message

26/10/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263733310398 Could you please reshare your O level results?
26/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 287 1648: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you  @263712871648

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Good evening. Indeed we have gone through the offer letter and we are delighted for this opportunity
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 287 1648: True, this approach can really work for us, thus we can proceed with the discussion
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 287 1648: 1. The tuition fee per annum after the scholarship is zero
2. Accommodation per annum after scholarship is zero
3. The annual fee at MVN after the scholarship is $1250
4. Sports and Miscellaneous fee is $250
5. Admission and processing fee is $1000
15/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details @263712871648. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Indeed, this makes the education more affordable for our daughter.  We just want to find out if food expenses are part of the Accommodation
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263712871648 The food is not included in these. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/11/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Praise's annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 287 1648: This is well understood. Are there any other expenses that we need to take care of that are not catered for by the scholarship? How are the students supposed to access food since they would be resident at the university?
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263712871648  addressing this query of yours, food is not included in the services offered and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this we are together?
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 287 1648: It's clear now
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Praise per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Maybe before you proceed to the EWYL, can you shed some light regarding Visa issue
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Praise's total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Yes, this is clear
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents.
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how Praise can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 287 1648: This clearly demonstrates the advantages of EWYL program
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263712871648. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Praise will dedicate to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1250 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Well understood
15/11/23, 9:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1250. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1250 - $1,000 = $250 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Sure
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Praise through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Sure, please explain
15/11/23, 9:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Praise's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Yes, we are in agreement
15/11/23, 10:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 10:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 287 1648: I reside in Harare
15/11/23, 10:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 10:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 287 1648: That would be most appreciated considering that bank transfers could be a challenge here in Zimbabwe
15/11/23, 10:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263712871648. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
15/11/23, 10:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 10:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 10:53 pm - +263 71 287 1648: At the moment, everything seems to be fine. I will ask if anything comes up.
15/11/23, 10:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Sure if you have any concern in future please feel free to share them with us. I will be more than happy to assist you dear. Moving further, Let me share the university insight.

21/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Thank you for providing the reference as this is crucial for us to have insights of the experiences in India regarding this educational program.
21/11/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $425, or you can opt to pay the full $850 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 287 1648: We had settled for the option of making payment in installment with the initial payment of $425 being made before the 28th of November
21/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
21/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Due to challenges with our banking system, which I believe you are aware of,  we prefer not to use the banking system,  but rather one of your trusted agents who will provide us with acknowledgement of receipt
21/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let me share his contact number with you so that you can connect with him.
21/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

21/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 287 1648: 24 November all things being equal
21/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 287 1648: Latest would be 27 November
21/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of the date and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?

As per the discussion that we had here earlier, you were planning to make the payment of Praise's registration fee by 24th November, however, I have not received an update from your side on that. 

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
