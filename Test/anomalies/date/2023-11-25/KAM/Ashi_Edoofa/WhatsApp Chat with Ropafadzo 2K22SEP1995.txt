06/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir its correct

06/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, of course you can do that.
06/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir
06/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 568 6816: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 568 6816: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 568 6816: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
06/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okaee sir i am now familiar with the processes
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
06/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 568 6816: If i remember correctly there will be a selection of university then once the offer letter comes payment of $700 is required
06/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be correct. However the fee is on a range from $500 to $750.
06/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir
06/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Not yet sir can u please enlighten me on this opportunity
06/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Ropafadzo, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
07/09/23, 12:03 am - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir this would be really helpful to my family
07/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Good afternoon. Its Ropafadzo's mom. Today she is in school. If possible you can go ahead and send she will start responding after school
07/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update. With continuation of our previous conversation, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
07/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Yes
07/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
07/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Goodafternoon sir....i was not really aware of that
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
07/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
07/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 568 6816: I have gone through them all we can proceed sir
07/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
07/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
07/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Ok i understand now
07/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 568 6816: This is actually great because it will be able  to help my family financially by securing my seat early
07/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Well understood sir
07/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 568 6816: What is the total fees expected per year?
07/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir thank you
09/09/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today? <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 568 6816: I am good sir how are you?
09/09/23, 9:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
09/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir we may continue
09/09/23, 10:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your previous concern, the exact fees will be mentioned in your offer lette. However, the total cost of the education will not exceed the $2000 - $3000 that was discussed with you. May I know if you are clear?
09/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir well understood
09/09/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Shall we move ahead with the session?
09/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/09/23, 10:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/09/23, 10:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 11, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 11, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 11, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 568 6816: I understand sir i hv no questions yet
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 568 6816: Yes you may share the information so that i get to know how it will be assessed
09/09/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
09/09/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
09/09/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
09/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 568 6816: Okae i understand now we may proceed
09/09/23, 10:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 568 6816: Yes thats true
09/09/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
09/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 568 6816: I agree with bemefit 5 and 6  buh benefit number 7 is wrong because from what you said earlier the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL programme if they fail to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades
09/09/23, 10:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed your concern is understandable. For a better understanding about the same shall we proceed further?
09/09/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 568 6816: Yes we can
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 568 6816: Ok i understand
09/09/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 568 6816: Okaw thats great
09/09/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 568 6816: Ok i understand
09/09/23, 11:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/09/23, 11:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 568 6816: Ok i understand
09/09/23, 11:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 568 6816: I completely understand now sir <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 568 6816: They are all clear now sir we may proceed
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir thank you. Have a nice day

11/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, Mrs. Melody. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
11/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 254 6217: So far so good. Well explained we have understood.
11/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Just for interest sake how long does it take to choose a university or to be selected by a University?
11/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will take you a week time for the arrival of the offer letter, Mrs. Melody.
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
12/09/23, 4:37 am - +263 77 254 6217: Good morning Sir. Noted. I believe we can go ahead and start working on the admission process
12/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Ropafadzo.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Goodafternoon sir how are you?
12/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 568 6816: I am now available if its possible to proceed with our session
12/09/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, with further continuation.  After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir we are on the same page
12/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
12/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
12/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Ok sir i understand
12/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes we may proceed with the discussion first
12/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes I understand
12/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir we are on the same page we may continue
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 568 6816: They are both clear now we may proceed
12/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 568 6816: The student first receives the offer letter from universties. Once the students receives the offer letter they will have a period of 15 days to pay the complete payment of 750 if one chooses rhe standard registration admission process but if the students decides to proceed with the early decision benefits they will receive an early decision grant of 150 which will be deducted from the 750 remaining with 600. The payment will be done in two parts where the first 300 is paid with 15 days and the second is paid within a month from the first deadline
12/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Well understood sir
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines *(1st October* and *1st November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare NAME’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 254 6217: You can go ahead.
12/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *1st October* and *1st November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
12/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Yes sir we are prepared
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Ropafadzo’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Ropafadzo’s higher education well.
12/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir
12/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Okae sir have a good day ahead as well
20/09/23, 9:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ropafadzo!

20/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 254 6217: So we are only given one university
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please take your time to go through it and once you are done, please let me know. Regarding the query that you have stay assured that I will help you in understanding the same during our conversation ahead.
20/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Ohk
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Please clarify on the issue of admission fees. Its saying we are to pay $750. 
According to what we had understood $150 is paid by Edoofa, 
$300 we pay as installment the the last $300 we pay by Nov
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Stay assured that we will clear all the queries that you have here during our conversation about the offer letter further. For now, may I know if you are done going through the letter please?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Yes i am done
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 254 6217: 1. $900
2. 3years or 6 semesters
3. $300
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. May you also share the answer to question number 4 with me dear?
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 254 6217: 4. $750
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 254 6217: That is very clear.
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Noted
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Following
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Very clear there
20/09/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Very clear
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 254 6217: I am very clear.
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Gweru
20/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 254 6217: But can even make payment from Harare
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 254 6217: Thank you. Will contact him
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 254 6217: It is still fine u can share the account number as well so that we weigh our options.
20/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 568 6816: Goodafternoon sir.. Do we have other university options
21/09/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ropafadzo!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 254 6217: Good morning. How are u  today.
21/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding that stay assured that I will help you in understanding about the same moving ahead during our conversation please.
21/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 254 6217: Thank you
21/09/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 254 6217: Following
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 254 6217: Ohk
21/09/23, 10:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 254 6217: Following
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 254 6217: We would like to know if we only get one option of University to choose from.
21/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 254 6217: Also is the University in the City or in rural areas
21/09/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here?
21/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 254 6217: Its now clear.
21/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 254 6217: We can proceed
21/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 254 6217: Very clear now. We will just be ready to pay hoping that by the end of October all will have responded so that we can choose wisely
21/09/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, as you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
21/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 254 6217: We are not going to let the opportunity pass.
21/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 254 6217: I was not aware of the transfer option
21/09/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/09/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 254 6217: Understood
21/09/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, may I know if you are entirely clear with the doubt that you had?
21/09/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 254 6217: Yes i am very clear. It is only that we do not really know the University. But now we are certain we can transfer if there is any need to
21/09/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine, on that note, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
21/09/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
