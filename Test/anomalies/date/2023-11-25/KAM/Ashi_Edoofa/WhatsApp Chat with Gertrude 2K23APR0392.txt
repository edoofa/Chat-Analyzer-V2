14/08/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am available sir
14/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 687 6578: We may start sir
14/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 687 6578: You may go ahead and explain sir
14/08/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 687 6578: The steps are clear
14/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 687 6578: All clear sir
14/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 687 6578: We are clear sir
14/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 687 6578: We may proceed
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 687 6578: May we have the next session tomorrow same time
14/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 687 6578: I would have gone through all of them
14/08/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 09.00 pm?
14/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 687 6578: I will try my best if the network will be stable sir
14/08/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm.
14/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Thank you sir
14/08/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
14/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier today, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/08/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Good evening sir
14/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am available to connect with you now
14/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
14/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Yes sir l was able to go through the videos
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
14/08/23, 9:06 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good evening everyone.  Unfortunately l just knocked off now l didn't get time to go through the videos.
14/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 687 6578: What l understood about the videos is that the 
Edoofa Scholarship helps students so as to achieve their dreams and the founder of the Edoofa program formed this program so as to avoid issues of paying for scholarships and at the end of the day end up not going to the university you had applied for hence through Edoofa they ensure that you get admission to the right university and ensure that the students dreams are fulfilled
14/08/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright @447385872436, I am sure, you will understand the summary that is shared by @263716876578 and get to know the gist of the videos.
14/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Well understood sir
14/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 687 6578: We may move forward sir
14/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Wednesday at 01.00 pm.
14/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

Social structures include families, government and economic system. These are also include the Norms and Values that are instilled in an individual that one is expected to follow. These social structures have a major impact in an individual's life for example the family helps in guiding the child and they are also the ones who are responsible for how a child grows up. The should follow the footsteps of other family members for instance the type of dressing other family members follow the child is also suppose to follow in order for him or she to be acceptable in the family. Social structures also determine how a person interacts amongst other people in the society and their behaviour patterns. Lastly social structures also affect people because they limit an individual from doing certain thing . They also to shape one's behaviour to become a better person in the society
16/08/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 687 6578: QUESTION 3 
 *Please explain the relation between Sociology and Economics* 
Sociology deals with the relationship between humans and society whilst Economics helps to understand the pattern of want and the consumption of humans in the society. Sociology and Economics both use scientific methods for studying thier respective areas of interest. Economics is mainly concerned with man's economic aspects , is also directly correlated to society's social activities. Similarly sociology is concerned with the study of social beings . Economics is also considered as a branch of social science and as a disciple, it is also considered as a branch sociology
However sociology primary deals with the studies of society and social relationships whereas economic studies about wealth and choice . Sociology emerged as a science of society very recently whereas economics is comparatively and older science
16/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 687 6578: *QUESTION 4 
What is the role of institutions in society do they perform positive functions or simply work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerful? elaborate with example* 
An institution is a humanly devised structure of rules and norms that shape and contain an individual behaviour examples of the institutions include religion, family, education and government.
These are the  backbone of society without these institutions society can not achieve fulfilment in terms of economy. When there are no rules and regulations in the society people are more likely to indulge in crime hence these institutions create peace and tranquility in the society.

These institutions also have negative impacts on people. This can led to the breaking down of families which may cause divorces. One should note that these divorces affect children in the future to the extent of them having to divorce and having more than one marriage.
Family breakdowns also increase teen crime rates due to lack of norms and values
16/08/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 687 6578: *QUESTION 5
Explain primary and secondary groups as the two Sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups* 
Primary groups are small and characterised by small close , personal relationships that last a long time 
These can also be relationships that are deeply personal and loaded with emotions . The members typically include family , childhood friends, romantic partners . The ties that bind the relationship in primary groups are made up of love , caring , concern and loyalty. These relationships play important roles in the formation of individual sense of self and identity because these people are influential in the development of values , norms , morals and everyday behaviour and practices of all members of the group. The relationship play important roles in the process of socialisation that people experience as they age
Secondary groups comprise relatively impersonal and temporary relationship that are goal or task oriented. Secondary groups are created so as to carry out a task to achieve a goal . A person becomes a member of a secondary group voluntarily out of shared interests with others involved. An example of this are co-workers in an employment setting or students and teachers
16/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Sociology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Yes sir
16/08/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am ready to start with the counseling
16/08/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Indeed it is not possible
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 687 6578: We indeed discussed about the registration fee
16/08/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 687 6578: It well understood
16/08/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 687 6578: It is clear
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am following sir
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Everything was well explained sir
16/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 687 6578: I will surely do that sir
16/08/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, alright have a great day ahead.
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Have a great day as well sir 
Thank you very much
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you.

21/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are ready to start with the discussion?
21/09/23, 10:12 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes l am ready to start this discussion
21/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

21/09/23, 10:19 pm - +44 7385 872436: Thank you very much 👏🏼

21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are so excited for this opportunity. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/09/23, 10:37 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes,, l have finished reviewing them,,, oooh Edoofa Team you are marvellous,, am just impressed by the benefits of Endowment program 👏
21/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and thank you for your kind words. Amazing, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 10:40 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes this point is clear
21/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 10:43 pm - +44 7385 872436: Woow,,, this is amazing, really impressive.  I do understand
21/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 10:51 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes,, l do understand well thank you
21/09/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/09/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/09/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 11:04 pm - +44 7385 872436: I am following the details quite well,, and it is commendable that you have the flexibility offer for the Edoofians.
21/09/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are following and thank you for kind words. 

Now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 11:11 pm - +44 7385 872436: I would like you to provide more details please
21/09/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/09/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
21/09/23, 11:46 pm - +44 7385 872436: Well understood,,,
Just to clarify,, so if a student gets favorable result, and university does re evaluation,,, then the final quantum be determined does that mean the percentage of the scholarship can possibly increase??
22/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Gertrude.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please that is absolutely correct.
22/09/23, 10:19 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good evening.  Yes l am available to continue with the discussion
22/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear here?
22/09/23, 10:22 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes,,, it's clear now
22/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
22/09/23, 10:24 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes ,,, definitely
22/09/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/09/23, 10:26 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes well understood 👏
22/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
22/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
22/09/23, 10:29 pm - +44 7385 872436: Honestly this is impressive 👏
22/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now moving ahead.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
22/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
22/09/23, 10:31 pm - +44 7385 872436: It sounds too good to be true,,, what an opportunity you are offering to these students 👏
22/09/23, 10:31 pm - +44 7385 872436: I understand Sir
22/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
22/09/23, 10:44 pm - +44 7385 872436: Well understood
22/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/09/23, 10:58 pm - +44 7385 872436: I don't have any questions.  You explained well
22/09/23, 11:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Gertrude's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Gertrude is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
22/09/23, 11:10 pm - +44 7385 872436: Am very excited for the next steps
22/09/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
22/09/23, 11:15 pm - +44 7385 872436: Thank you very much.  I greatly appreciate your assistance and taking me through this process for admission 👏🏼👏🏼
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gertrude!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gertrude!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 1:30 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good afternoon.  
Am very happy,  over the moon that Gertrude has received the offer letter. 
Yes l have gone over it
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 1:38 pm - +44 7385 872436: 1. Tuition fee per semester is $1800
2. Standard duration is 3 years
3. $300
4. $750
29/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Gertrude, please go through the letter once again and then let me know of point number one again.
29/09/23, 2:04 pm - +44 7385 872436: Tuition fee after the scholarship is $900
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes l am clear now
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - +44 7385 872436: I understand,,, so is it possible for the student to be able to secure accommodation off campus before arriving for school? How easy is it??
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, it is completely possible and for that, the university officials along with the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will help you. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 3:38 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes,,, it is clear.
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 4:06 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes, we are together
29/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 4:25 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes its very clear on that issue. Thank you
29/09/23, 4:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 4:26 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes, it's clear
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gertrude!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
30/09/23, 10:46 am - +44 7385 872436: Good morning,  we are all fine thank you. 
Yes we are clear, thank you.  
Is it possible to pay using PayPal?
30/09/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can use PayPal to make the payment of your registration fee as well. Now, The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/09/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/09/23, 10:53 am - +44 7385 872436: I am currently in UK for work,   so that is why l was thinking l could use PayPal.  When in Zimbabwe residing in Bulawayo
30/09/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, if you wish to use PayPal for making the payment of your registration fee, you can surely do that. For that, once you are ready to make the payment, you can let me know and I will get the PayPal Invoice generated for you so that you can make the payment. Is that clear?
30/09/23, 11:10 am - +44 7385 872436: Yes it is clear
30/09/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, for your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
30/09/23, 11:29 am - +44 7385 872436: Well noted. Thank you. 
 I have a question,  on the payment , are students paying per annum or per semester?
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gertrude!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that, the fee payment is done on a semester basis, which means that the parents won't have to face the financial burden all at onec. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good day Sir.
Thank you very much for getting back to us 
Yes it's very clear 
I will be ready to make the payment tomorrow.
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 4:10 pm - +44 7385 872436: Very clear. Thank you very much
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 4:35 pm - +44 7385 872436: Yes,,, the EWYL program is a great idea.
04/10/23, 10:17 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good evening Sir.
May you please generate a PayPal invoice for me when you are ready.
05/10/23, 1:10 pm - +44 7385 872436: My email address 
methieclara@gmail.com
05/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gertrude!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please let me know of the amount that you are planning to pay today?
05/10/23, 1:23 pm - +44 7385 872436: The 600usd.
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, on that note, with the 10% transfer charges that would incur while making the payment through PayPal, the total Invoice amount would be $660. Now, let me get the invoice generated for you to make the payment.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, since you are making a direct payment, what we would advise is that you make the payment directly through our payment portal. This was done to make the payment process easier for the parents. 

To do that, you can go to: https://www.edoofa.com/

And on that page, you can click on the Pay Now Button to make the payment directly. An additional benefit that you will get by doing so is that you won't have to pay any charges please. I hope this is clear?
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - +44 7385 872436: It is clear. 
So in this case l have to pay 600usd,, no charges?
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right.
05/10/23, 1:41 pm - +44 7385 872436: Thank you very much Sir.
Well understood 👏
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, once you are done making the payment with this mode, please share the snippet of the payment completion with me here.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - +44 7385 872436: I will do so thank you very much.
06/10/23, 10:46 am - +44 7385 872436: Good morning Sir
06/10/23, 10:47 am - +44 7385 872436: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 10:47 am - +44 7385 872436: This is what l got after completing the payment.
06/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
06/10/23, 12:44 pm - +44 7385 872436: Thank you Sir.
06/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. Now, on that note, I just received an update from the side of the accounts team, that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed. However, there was a slight miscommunication from my end, that there won't be any transfer charges on using that mode, but the accounts team officials just reconfirmed that the transfer charges while using this mode are 7% of the total amount. Hence, you would have to clear that balance as well. 

I apologize for the confusion created here. Now, on that note, can you please confirm by when will you be able to clear the 7% transfer charges, i.e. $42 please?
06/10/23, 1:24 pm - +44 7385 872436: Noted Sir. I will make that payment of 7% transfer charges on Monday.
I will let you know once done.
06/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you.
10/10/23, 12:06 pm - +44 7385 872436: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:07 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good morning Sir
Payment of the outstanding $42 made
10/10/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gertrude!

10/10/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine please, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, thank you for sharing the receipt with me here, it is well noted with us please.
23/11/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gertrude,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
