23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay sir
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes sir I have understood
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes you can proceed
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes sir

23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

Welly recieved and noted
Be Blessed!
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263788961515, Please make sure to go through the videos
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 896 1515: I will surely go through them
24/11/23, 8:01 am - +263 77 937 2267: Good morning to you all. My name is Godfrey Chiwara, the father of Nyarai Chiwara. As you requested about the Videos presented by Edoofa cofounders, l have gone through them and l would like to share my understanding about them.
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 937 2267: Video number 1
Firstly l would like to point out that this video is quite exciting, informative and educative.
The Video is being presented by the Edoofa cofounders. They are highlighting that it is a special video for all students who have just enrolled with Edoofa. They went on further to review the process for one to get to this stage of watching these videos which are registration and eligibility check. The cofounders referred the viewer to pictures of students who have successfully enrolled with Edoofa pinned on the wall they refer to as "Edoofa,s hall of Fame". They talked about smiles on those students' faces. They pointed out those smiles are not only about the students' gratitude but also about students' awareness that they have embarked on a life transforming educational journey. The cofounders also talked about the EWYL program and emphasized on that program to create students' independence. Independence is created by the program's potential to lighten the parents or guardian' burden on meeting their portion of the fees. The contribution can be reduced to zero if a student earns high credits.EWYL offers an opportunity to earn whilst one is learning.

The cofounders also talked about their experience when they visited Africa. African students face challenges in meeting the exorbitant fees for their education. The cofounders of talked types of students they encountered who are successful students and failures.  They found out that failures always blame their circumstances and do not have an open mind. Whilst successful students have an open mind  and are always willing to go an extra mile.

The cofounders also talked about lessons which could be learnt from what Steve Jobs did as a young man ( just 20 years old)  and with little education ( just a fifth grader).
 Steve jobs had a ambition to manufacture frequency calculators and had the courage to look for HP company's CEO number. He also had the courage to phone the CEO.  The CEO was impressed and offered Steve Jobs employment. The other lesson which could be learnt is that when you need something and you also want to succeed ask the experts. Edoofa has a lot of experts so you should be comfortable and your success is somehow guaranteed.
 
The cofounders concluded their presentation by highlighting two important things which are
1. One should always follow instructions.
2. One should always be open minded.

Lessons learnt are
1 have courage
2. Be open minded
3. Be independent
3. World is full of opportunities.
4. Follow instructions.
5. Always ask the experts.
6. Life is full of smiles if you do the right thing.

 This again is a wonderful video presented by the cofounders. The video talks about Edoofa's vision and their expectations from students. 
 The cofounders share  the experience of one African student who chose not to follow instructions properly. The student ended up dealing with another asian agent who conned the student money. The agent promised to process the student's papers and advised the student that he had links with Chinese institutions. The student initial paid US$1000.00 and waited for three months but nothing happened. The student was further conned US$300.00 to rereoute his papers. The moral of this story is that students should follow instructions so as to avoid losing money and time.
The cofounders further share the two main problems which are being faced by students from Africa which are exorbitant cost of education  and employability. The cofounders said that their solutions to these problems which Edoofa provides have been curved out their knowledge acquired over more than 10 years invested in supporting students. Solutions they identified for the exorbitant cost of education are:
1. Provision of scholarship programs
2. EWYL programs which work together with scholarship programs.
 Solutions for employability are;
1. Carefully selected institutions which work with Edoofa.
2 like minded community of students who work together to solve challenges they face.
3. Acquisition of requisite skills by students as they learn through EWYL
4. Convincing high flying institutions to work with Edoofa. 
5 assisting students to make the right choices through a robust enrolment system and processes.

The cofounders also pointed out that there are many institutions in India which do not offer high quality education, are crooks and focus only on making money. They do not work with such institutions.  They also also pointed out that Eoofa' s purpose is not just to get a student enrolled with an educational institution in India; it is more than that.
 The cofounders also encouraged parents to    advise  their children about the harsh realities of life. Parents should build the student's right attitude. The student should take 100 percent responsibility of their lives
 
The cofounders also gave an imaginary example of a vast sea, a gigantic tank and a cup. They said that the vast sea represent the world opportunities and the tank and cup represents the student's capacity. A student from Edoofa is like a gigantic tank ready to hold the vast opportunities (water) from the world (sea). And other students are like a cup which does not hold much water or opportunities from the world or water from the sea.

Lessons learnt.
1. Have the right attitude.
2. Be open minded.
3. Trust Edoofa.
4. Follow instructions.
5. Edoofa has the potential to solve a student's problems.
6. World is full of opportunities which you can embrace if you have the right skills and values.
7.Edoofa guarantees employability. 
8. Always work with expects.
9. You may loose money and time if you do not follow instructions.
10. Take 100 percents responsibility of your life

Thank you for sharing your understanding regarding the videos with us @263779372267. I am delighted to see that you have collected such amazing insights, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
