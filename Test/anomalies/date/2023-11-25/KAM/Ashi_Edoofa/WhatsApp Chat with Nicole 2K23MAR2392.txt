13/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
13/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 754 1116: It has been  long  I still  want to  re visit
13/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
13/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Proceed
13/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
13/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
13/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay
13/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 754 1116: I remember
13/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:
13/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
13/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
13/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes it's  clear
13/09/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
13/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay
13/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
13/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Is it possible  to make payment  plan  on admission  fee
13/09/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is possible we will be getting on that soon in our future session. So, shall we proceed?
13/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes  we can  proceed
13/09/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 5:26 am - +263 77 754 1116: Good morning  
Just waiting  to hear  the Good news  from  you
14/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Nicole. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good evening Mr  Shivjeet. We are doing  fine and how are you
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Let's  proceed
14/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
14/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
14/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
14/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok we can proceed
14/09/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
14/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
15/09/23, 6:43 am - +263 77 754 1116: Good morning. Its clear
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Nicole. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are available to proceed with the session.
15/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet
15/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We can  proceed
15/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am now continuing with the session.
15/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok yes
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
15/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, kindly excuse me for the late reply, I was on a short break. Shall we further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good evening
15/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Let's  proceed
15/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 754 1116: It's  clear
15/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes   please  can I have  more information
15/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok I understand
15/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 754 1116: I agree  with  number 1 and 2
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 754 1116: I disagree  3
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
15/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I'm  clear
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
15/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok
15/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 754 1116: No querie
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We can proceed
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we shall connect on Monday at 7:30 PM. Have a great weekend.
15/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Thank you
18/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Nicole,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good evening Mr  Shivjeet,We are all fine  and how are you?
18/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I'm good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We can  proceed
18/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Mrs Butawu, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
18/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes  I had
18/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 754 1116: And I understand the  advantages of early admission
18/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
18/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 754 1116: You can  go ahead  with the admission
18/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
18/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes we are  on the same page
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
18/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes It's  clear  .
18/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Thank you  Good  night
19/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet
19/09/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Nicole,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good evening Mr Shivjeet
19/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok noted
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 754 1116: I'm  doing  fine  and  how are you
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I  ready
20/09/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We can  start
20/09/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 9th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, the deadline becomes the 9th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 9th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 9th of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We are  on the same page
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 754 1116: They are  clear
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
20/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay
20/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Our  registration fee  is $750 and if I have  the grant  of $150 ,it means  my registration  fee  is $600.
20/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 754 1116: The first  payment off $300 is to be  paid  in 15 days  due to the date  that  I was given  an offer  letter  and the other  $300  to be paid  after  30 day
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear on this?
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I'm  clear
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *9th October* and *9th November*.
20/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *9th October* and *9th November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Nicole’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 754 1116: You can go ahead.
20/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Nicole’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *9th October* and *9th November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
20/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 754 1116: It's  advantages  saving of $150, Let me  use  the opportunity
20/09/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed, you will be experiencing the opportunities soon. Now, Can safely say assume that you are mentally prepared for the next steps?
20/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I am.
20/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Nicole’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Nicole’s higher education well.
20/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay noted thank you?
20/09/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Nicole. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay thank you.
26/09/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓 <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
26/09/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Thank you
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good afternoon  and how are you?
27/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I did  go through the  offer  letter
27/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 754 1116: We can  discuss
27/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 754 1116: 1 . Semester  tuition  fee is $900usd
2.Standard duration of the course  4years  (8 semester)
3 . Admission  and  procedure  fee (one time  payable) $300
4. Registration fee is $750.
27/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I'm clear
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Admission  and  Registration  are 2 different  fees  write
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 754 1116: And when is the due date  for admission  fee
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with that here. 

--> The admission and processing fee of $300 is a one-time payment for the administrative and processing costs related to your admission to Galgotias University. It's not part of your tuition or recurring fees.

--> The registration fee of $750 is a separate fee that you need to pay to reserve your scholarship seat at the university. But since you are an Edoofian, this fee is a part of your tuition fees; it's a one-time payment to secure your place at the university.

I hope you are clear with that now?
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes it's  clear
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 754 1116: What about admission  we never  discussed  about  it
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well, can you please come again?
27/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Tha admission  fee  we did not  discuss  about the  fee  and when  is the  due date
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, have you paid attention to this message of mine please?
27/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok
28/09/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, I believe that you are clear about the fact that the admission processing fee has been waived off from your Offer Letter due to the Early Decision Waiver, right?
28/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 754 1116: Yes
28/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 754 1116: Good morning dear
28/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I'm  in Harare
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay  thank you
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 754 1116: What's  if I can  use my account  using  Visa card
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Is it possible
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Or I can  compare the costs difference
28/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please you can do that as well. But before that, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Don't worry about  Mr Charles
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yours  it's cheaper  so if my Visa card  account  is more  than  7 percent  , I will  use Mr Rajan
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, on that note, you can use whichever mode you wish to based on which one is more economical to you. I hope this is clear?
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes it's  clear
28/09/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Ok
28/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes it's  clear
28/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Yes I see
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 754 1116: No queries.
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
28/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay  thank you.
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! Have a good day ahead!
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Thank you  same to  you
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Brendon!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
29/09/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Good morning. Yes we manage  to discuss  about the  offer  letter
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
29/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 754 1116: They were happy  for me. And they were  very  happy  about  the  payment  plan.
29/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have been working hard to ensure that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 754 1116: No you  explain  everything  that  makes me  understand
29/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
29/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
