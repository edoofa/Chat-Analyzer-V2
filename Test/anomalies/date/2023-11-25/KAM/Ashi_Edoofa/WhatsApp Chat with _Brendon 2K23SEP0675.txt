21/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Done
21/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
21/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
21/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Am i the one who prepares  the statement of purpose
21/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we will be assisting you with your Statement of Purpose as we move forward.
21/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok
21/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Following
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
21/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
21/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Yes we can
21/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
22/09/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

24/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Question:Explain about BPM(businessprocessmanagement)life cycle 

The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle involves six stages. Firstly, it starts with process identification, where existing processes are documented and stakeholders are identified. Secondly, the processes are analyzed to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement. Metrics are defined to measure process performance. Thirdly, processes are redesigned to achieve desired outcomes, eliminating unnecessary steps. Fourthly, the redesigned processes are implemented with employee training and system updates. Fifthly, the implemented processes are monitored using key performance indicators to measure effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, process optimization is undertaken to address issues and continuously improve performance. The BPM life cycle enables organizations to streamline operations, improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and adapt to changing business requirements. It is a continuous and iterative process that drives operational excellence.
24/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Questions:how does business contribute to economic development. With an example 

Business plays a crucial role in economic development as it contributes to the growth of a nation's economy in various ways. Firstly, businesses generate employment opportunities, leading to a reduction in unemployment rates and an increase in income levels. This, in turn, improves the standard of living and reduces poverty levels within a society. Additionally, businesses pay taxes, which are vital for funding public infrastructure, healthcare, education, and other essential services provided by the government .for example large companies like tesla and Toyota pays high tax to the government because of their high sales.

Furthermore, businesses drive innovation and technological advancements, which are key drivers of economic growth. They invest in research and development, leading to the creation of new products, services, and processes. For instance, companies in the technology sector such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft have constantly introduced innovative products that have transformed industries and created new markets.

In conclusion, businesses contribute to economic development by creating employment, paying taxes, driving innovation, and attracting foreign direct investment.
24/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Question :Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talents/skills 

"I'm a young person who has a lot of poteyntial when it comes to management and leadership. I'm a quick thinker who's able to solve problems and make decisions that align with the overall goal. For example, when my class was tasked with creating a fundraising campaign, I quickly identified the need for a clear plan and a specific goal. I then worked with my team to come up with creative ideas and evaluate their feasibility. In the end, our class raised more money than we had hoped for, and we were able to make a real difference in our community.actively applied my financial management skills within the school environment. Other  remarkable example is when I led a fundraising campaign for a charitable cause. I meticulously developed a comprehensive budget and financial plan to maximize the impact of our efforts. By effectively managing resources and expenses, our team not only surpassed our fundraising target but also made a tangible difference in the lives of those in need.

25/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Correct
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Following
25/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
25/09/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/09/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

25/09/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/09/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/09/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/09/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 080 1097: So far i have no questions
25/09/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

25/09/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.

26/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Now moving ahead, in this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?

4. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/09/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/09/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 080 1097: Following
30/09/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 080 1097: I'm not aware
30/09/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/09/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
30/09/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
30/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Now Clear
30/09/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok
30/09/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Yes i agree
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
30/09/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
30/09/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 080 1097: When am i going to receive the list of universities <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 443 7119: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 7:07 am - +263 78 080 1097: Hello
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Brendon.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Available now
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now coming back to your concern, the universities do take a week's time to generate the offer letter @263780801097
03/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok noted
03/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please now as your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
03/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Yes
03/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
03/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok thanks
03/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night ahead.

06/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Thank you
06/10/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome dear. Now, please take your time to go through the offer letter and then we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time.
06/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok
07/10/23, 12:34 am - +263 71 443 7119: It's great to learn about the offer. As a family we are thrilled with the opportunity given to Brendon. We thank you very much for assisting him. God bless.
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Brendon!
I hope you are doing well. 

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
07/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
07/10/23, 9:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now Brendon?
07/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 080 1097: Yes
07/10/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
07/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Tuition fee after scholarship is 900
Standard duration of course 3 years 
Admission and procedure fee 300
Registration fee 100
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Brendon!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
09/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
09/10/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 080 1097: We are together
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Clear
09/10/23, 7:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
09/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 080 1097: There is need of 750 to reserve the seat
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 20th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 20th November 2023.*
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *20th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
10/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Brendon!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Not in harare but my brother is in harare
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ok
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 080 1097: You may share
10/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Isn't it 900 ,per Annum tuition fee after scholarship
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, I believe there must be a misunderstanding. For that, you can take a look at the letter again, and you can get a clarity on the same that the fee per semester is $900 and per annum, it is $1800 please.
11/10/23, 5:39 am - +263 78 080 1097: Ok i see

That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
