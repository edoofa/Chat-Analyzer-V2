30/08/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/08/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 366 8176: We can start, no problem
30/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Done
30/08/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/08/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/08/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 366 8176: We can proceed
30/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear, thank u
30/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/08/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Following
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/08/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
30/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/08/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Let's proceed
30/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
30/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
30/08/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes,you can
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/08/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Today we are having network challenges this side. Let me try to open. Will come back to u soo n
30/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand. In that case, let us reconnect on Friday at 01.00 p.m. I hope you will be available on Friday since we will not be available tomorrow on the occasion of an Indian Festival.
30/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 591 1190: It's ok thank you
30/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
01/09/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
01/09/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 366 8176: Yes we watched them
01/09/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
01/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, for a successful journey with Edoofa, students should be teachable and open minded. They should also  follow Edoofa's instructions. Beside getting affordable and quality education and making students employable through SEELS program, Edoofa also focuses on increasing students' capacity for success, thus enhancing accountability and independence  on students . 
Again, Edoofa  took a lot of time  identifying good schools, colleges and universities for  students depending on their passion. Therefore, students are being encouraged to be sober minded and be  vigilant so as to prepare and be qualified for the Institutions.
01/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
01/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
01/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
01/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very true 👏👏
01/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
01/09/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, let's move
01/09/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
01/09/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
01/09/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

01/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please try refreshing the page, The Online SOP form is required to be filled out online only by going through the link provided in the message. It is done so as the details are to be transferred to our records automatically after you have submitted the form.
02/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 71 591 1190: I believe the SOP showed up around 4-5 pm yesterday , I'm now answering questions on the second document
02/09/23, 7:41 am - +263 71 591 1190: 2 *)WHAT IS THE REASON FOR SHORT SIGHTEDNESS OR MYOPIA ,HOW CAN IT BE CORRECTED*

Myopia or short sightedness ,is a refractive error in the eye where light focuses in front of the retina , causing distinct objects to appear blurred .It can be caused by the eyeballs being too long,the cornea being too curved ,or the lences being too strong . It's a common condition, affecting about 30% of people in the U.S and even more in East Asia .Myopia can be caused by genetic factors , excessive  near work for example reading or screen time and not spending enough time outdoors . Nearsightedness can be corrected in several ways , including glasses contact lenses especially designed to counteract the effect ,or refractive surgery like LASIK ( Laser - Assisted in Situ Keratomiteusis ).The goal of correction is to shift the focus of light into the retina , allowing for clear vision . It can be reduced  naturally by living a healthy lifestyle and doing positive activities, including relaxing the eyes so that the aye muscles do not become tense .
02/09/23, 7:41 am - +263 71 591 1190: 3 *) WHT IS YOUR OPINION IS LASIK SURGERY ,DO YOU THINK IT IS COMETIC OR MEDICALLY CORRECTIVE PROCEDURE ? AND CAN IT CAN BE USED ON SOMEONE WIT A RETINA DEFECT ,WHY OR WHY NOT* 

LASIK stands for Laser - Assisted in Situ Keratomiteusis .It is a procedure that permanently changes the shape of the cornea,the clear covering of the front of the eye ,using an excimer laser .A mechanical microkeratomeor a laser Keratome is used to cut out a flap in the cornea .
LASIK is used to correct refractive errors like nearsightedness,farsighnatedness ,and astimatism . These conditions can cause functional issues with vision ,like difficulty in driving , reading or performing daily task .LASIK alters the shape of the cornea ,which is the clear outer layer of the eye ,in order to improve vision . It's not a cosmetic procedure like plastic surgery ,which changes the appearance of body parts .It is a medical procedure to correct refractive problems and improve vision ,it may have cosmetic advantages ,as it is a severe treatment that trained and experienced doctors should only perform .It is possible to have laser corrective surgery (LASIK) after repair of the retinal detachment in select cases.
02/09/23, 7:41 am - +263 71 591 1190: 4) *EXPLAIN THE TECHNIQUE TO MAINTAIN GOOD EYESIGHT* 

- Healthy diet with plenty of antioxidants,like those found in greens and fish . Eating food that contains nutrients like lutein,zinc and vitamin C and E ,these can help ward off age - related vision problems like macular degeneration and catarates 
- Exercising regularly to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of eye disease like glaucoma 
- Blinking frequently to keep eyes moist and prevent dry eye syndrome 
- Take breaks form screen time to prevent eye strain and fatigue .Staring at a computer or phones screens for too long can cause eyestrain,blurry vision,dry eyes and headaches 
- Wearing sunglasses , this help protect eyes from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays
- Quit smoking,this makes a person more likely to get catarates ,damage to the optic nerve ad macular degeneration 
- Visiting the eye doctor regularly ,this help predicting diseases like glaucoma,that have no symptoms ,it's important to spot them early on when they're easier to treat
02/09/23, 7:41 am - +263 71 591 1190: 5) *PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSES LAZY EYE SYNDROME , ESPECIALLY IN KIDS* 

 Lazy eyes develope because of abnormal visual experience early in life that changes the nerve pathway between a thin layer of tissue (retina) at the back of the eye and the brain .The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals . Eventually ,the eye's ability to work together decreases and the brain suppresses or ignore from the weaker eye 
Common causes of the condition include : 
- Muscle imbalance (Strabismus amblyopia),in the muscles that position the eyes.This imbalance can cause the eyes to cross in or turn out ,and prevents them from working together
- Difference in sharpness of vision between between the eyes (refractive amblyopia).A significant difference between the prescriptions each eye - often due to farsightedness or an uneven surface curve of the eye (astigmatism) - can result in lazy eye  
- Deprivation .A problem with one eye - such as a cloudy area in the lense (cataract) - can prohibit clear vision in that eye 
- Strabismus ( misalignment of the eye) 
- Poor development of the visual system in one eye due to premature birth or other development issues

02/09/23, 7:43 am - +263 77 366 8176: This message was deleted
02/09/23, 7:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for submitting the SOP form and the academic interview questions it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
02/09/23, 7:56 am - +263 77 366 8176: Morning, I think the  documents will be shared by Monday since some are at school.
02/09/23, 8:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, we can wait for the documents and continue with the discussion, and once you are able to collect the documents on Monday you can share them, does this plan sound acceptable to you?
02/09/23, 8:01 am - +263 77 366 8176: Acceptable
02/09/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic interview questions, While we wait for the academic documents the rest is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will proceed to work on it so that your university application is well prepared.
02/09/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
02/09/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Optometry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
02/09/23, 8:06 am - +263 77 366 8176: Correct
02/09/23, 8:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
02/09/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 366 8176: Ready
02/09/23, 8:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
02/09/23, 8:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
02/09/23, 8:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
02/09/23, 8:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/09/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 591 1190: Yes clear
02/09/23, 8:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
02/09/23, 8:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
02/09/23, 8:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
02/09/23, 8:16 am - +263 71 591 1190: Yes she Did
02/09/23, 8:17 am - +263 71 591 1190: Well understood
02/09/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
02/09/23, 8:21 am - +263 71 591 1190: Yes we are
02/09/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 591 1190: <Media omitted>
02/09/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
02/09/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
02/09/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 591 1190: Yes
02/09/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
02/09/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
02/09/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 591 1190: Understood
02/09/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/09/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
02/09/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/09/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 591 1190: Clear
02/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 591 1190: Will wait for my mothers reply when she's online
02/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 366 8176: Noted, its very clear and the amount is very affodable, considering the payment plans. Thank you for that.
02/09/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 366 8176: Understood is the registration fee, how much may be the visa fee and flight expenses
02/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 366 8176: I am paying the registration fee when l am still home. So you mean to say  she will start earning  her EWYL credits while she is still home. I stand to be corrected  here.
02/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
02/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 366 8176: The admission process and higher  education  fee  is made clear, thank you.
02/09/23, 9:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear with everything, let me help you understand the questions raised by you @263773668176 

The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy and the visa would cost $83 yes you are absolutely correct Sharon will start with her EWYL Program while she is home. 

I hope we are clear now?
02/09/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 366 8176: Well explained, thank you
02/09/23, 9:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.

04/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, thank you and have a great day to you too.
04/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773668176 Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, since I was occupied with some personal work we will be connecting on the 6th of September at 01.30 pm since I will not be available tomorrow on the occasion of my Birthday. I hope you will be available.
04/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok noted
06/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Not yet
06/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand @263773668176, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
06/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Isn't it the EWYL Program, we were given a briefing.
06/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Sure
06/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Understood, thank you
06/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: EWYL Program is a benefit for all the Edoofains, however, this is an additional early decision benefit for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. So I wanted to make sure, that you are one of them who utilize this benefit @263773668176.
06/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 366 8176: So the admission  fee is used to reserve a seat at the university. 
What about the initial payment $350 enrollment fee, l learnt that it was for seat reservation. How many seats need to be reserved now🤷‍♀️
06/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773668176 I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $500- $750 registration fee is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. And we have an early decision benefit for you as well in the month of September 2023.

I hope you are clear now?
06/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear now
06/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
06/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 366 8176: I understand that Edoofa will pay the extra tuition, it will also assist by the EWYL program
06/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
06/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
06/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very true
06/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Thought it was not yet to be disclosed🤓
06/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
06/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Nop
06/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year to retake the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
06/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 366 8176: That's wonderful, thank you
06/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 366 8176: That's great you have a good plan
06/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Sorry am having network  challenges this side. We can continue
06/09/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
06/09/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
06/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear
06/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision
06/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Great news, you are stars team Edoofa
06/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. Now moving forward.

3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Taken
06/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Sure
06/09/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @263773668176 Kindly excuse me for the delay, since it was past our operational hours, however, if you are available to connect with us now, we can continue with our discussion.
06/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, 9 pm sharp
06/09/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very sorry, m experiencing challenges in network today, its a bad day
06/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Let's try
06/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you are clear here?
06/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear, $750 reg fee, will be cut to $600 after the $150 grant from Edoofa
06/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, Now In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Its clear
06/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Shed more light please
06/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Netwrk is becoming jealous again
06/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
06/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
06/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
07/09/23, 3:10 am - +263 77 366 8176: Great news,is there any possibility of a student getting more  than 50% scholarship
07/09/23, 3:26 am - +263 77 366 8176: Which factors are considered for a student to attain a maximum scholarship
07/09/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded, it was past our available working hours, so we could not get back to you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
07/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for her exams and starting with her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
07/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Good news
07/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
07/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, noted
07/09/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
07/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 366 8176: How many years are taken on the diploma courses , roughly
07/09/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you understand a Diploma course would take 3 years to complete.
07/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, thank you
07/09/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the 7 points again and if you have any concerns regarding them?
07/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Think u have cleared everything.
07/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion as a family concerning the next steps in Sharon's university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. 

We will connect today at 09.00 pm today for our discussion.
07/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, thank you
07/09/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
07/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Hallo
07/09/23, 11:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with some personal work, we shall reschedule our discussion for tomorrow 02.30 pm. I hope you will be available.
07/09/23, 11:24 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok thanks, l will be available
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Available, only that my network is a little  bit slow
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand. I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
08/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes, we were much impressed
08/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
08/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
08/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
08/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes l still recall, everything  is clear
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
08/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 366 8176: We can start
08/09/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
08/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
08/09/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
08/09/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
08/09/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 08th of September, the deadline becomes the 23rd of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 08th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 23rd of September 2023, making the second deadline the 23rd of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok
08/09/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
08/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear
08/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
08/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 366 8176: The admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

Say my Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which l have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
08/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
08/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
08/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
08/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *23rd September* and *23rd October*.
08/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *23rd September* and *23rd October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Sharon's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
08/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 366 8176: The early decision  benefit is valid up to which month?
08/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 366 8176: This message was deleted
08/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As informed earlier, the Early Decision Benefit is to finalize their admission in the month of September.
08/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Its too early for me
08/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted
09/09/23, 11:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sharon.

14/09/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now coming to your query, let me help you understand, the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September with the 7 benefits that Sharon will get.
14/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok continue
14/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *23rd September* and *23rd October*), you can give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare Sharon's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 366 8176: For the mean time my hands are tied up, l have nothing in mu cofers. Maybe Nov -Dec.
14/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773668176 I completely understand that you may not be ready, however, I would like to make you understand that the Early decision benefits are only for the students who wish to finalize their college admission in the month of September if you wish to continue in the month of November and December, then Sharon's process would be carried forward with the Standard admission process, where you would be required to pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days of receiving the offer letter and and without the $150 grant form Edoofa.
14/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So please I would like you to take some time to think properly have a discussion as a family and then come up with a decision by tomorrow, I would never want you to miss this opportunity for Sharon, as it doe not only offers flexible payment plans, plus the $150 grant along with the 7 benefits.
14/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Its ok, will come back to you
14/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
14/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Thank you
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Sharon.

16/09/23, 8:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, yes please let me help you understand, that would completely depend on when the university is able to generate Sharon's offer letter, usually, the letter is generated within a week time, so for example Sharon's offer letter was generated on the 18th of September 2023, you will be required to pay the $300 on 3rd October and the remaining $300 on the 3rd November. 

I hope we are clear here?
16/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 366 8176: Its ok, well  understood
16/09/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know, I am curious to know more about the discussion so may I know how the discussion went?
16/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 366 8176: This thing is between Edoofa, Sharon and l. Sharon is now at school and no phones are allowed at school. 

So the discussion was between me and myself. I resolved to go and apply for a bank loan so that l can pay the university. 

l have nothing in my account as of now, my poultry project  will give me something maybe October. 
August l paid fees. Sharon's spectacles were reframed in Aug again so it drained me. That admission fee was paid in Aug as well, so it was all on my shoulders. 

But l know we will sail through.
19/09/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Sharon,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 01.00 P.M. I hope this time works for you and we shall discuss the way further for Sharon's admission process then.  Have a great day!

25/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes maam
25/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 26th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 11th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 11th of November, 2023).

Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned *tentative deadlines ( 11th of October 2023, and 11th of November, 2023)*, you can give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare Sharon's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 366 8176: You can go ahead  team 🙏
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Sharon's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Sharon's higher education well.
25/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted, with thanks
25/09/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sharon!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Thank you team Edoofa for your support, you are stars
28/09/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Thank u once again
28/09/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Can you explain once again on fees structure and hostel fee
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes l went through it, and ready for discussions
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 366 8176: 1.$900
2.8 semesters 
3.$300
4.$750
29/09/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted, and who is going to cater for the accommodation fee. Edoofa of myself
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: The accommodation costs explained here are a part of the per annum costs of $2000-3000 therefore, it is to be catered by you. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 366 8176: O k noted, so u r saying if she opts for a 3 seated ac room she is going to pay $2000 plus $1800 per annum? Which is $3800 per annum
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. However, in order to get proper clarity on this, let us first complete the discussion here. Now, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Together
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear, if funds permit l will pay the whole amount before 13th
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 366 8176: I don't have that account
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Due to that,there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 366 8176: I am in Mashonaland Central province. Town - Mt Darwin
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, thank u
03/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
03/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 366 8176: I have them, don't worry
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Very clear
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Wonderful EWYL
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 366 8176: $1800 is affodable
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 366 8176: You mentioned independent accommodation, do you have shared accommodation
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the point that you have mentioned about Independent accommodation, it means that the accommodation options would be independent from the university please. Moving ahead, off-campus accommodation options are also shared and it is done to make them more affordable for the students please. I believe you are clear till here now, right?
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 366 8176: How much will be share accommodation per annum
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: As I have already mentioned here, it would be around $800 please. I hope this is clear?
05/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Clear
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 366 8176: I am well how are you
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Everything cleared
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
