29/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes they are very clear
29/09/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/09/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am
29/09/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/09/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes they are very clear
29/09/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
29/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I don't have any queries or suggestions
29/09/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we can start
29/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

From the first video which included the important message for the enrolled students I understood that the students should follow instructions and be open minded 

And the second video which includes the Edoofa's  vision for the students I understood that while Edoofa focuses on making education affordable and making students employable its great focus is on taking a student's capacity to success

And the third video was on schools , colleges and universities I understood that the Edoofa program identifies the right schools for the Edoofian students with good quality teachers and accomadation and all the Universities and Schools under the Edoofa program have the EWYL program  and the Edoofian students are encouraged to follow instructions

The the fourth video was about the SOP which is the Statement of Purpose from this video i understood that the SOP is a document that gives a student an opportunity to convince any school why they are worthy of being admitted or given a scholarship with a school. The SOP should also have my vision and why I chose to study a particular course
That's all I understood from the 4 videos
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

03/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Thank you I have understood better from your views
03/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we are
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

04/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 597 8719: 2) *Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and a further explanation on the difference between Human rights and Civil rights*

Rights are things that we are entitled while duties are things that we are expected to do, they are obligatory. The difference between human rights and civil rights is that human rights are universal , they apply to every individual regardless of nationality, race and religion whilst civil rights are specific to a particular country or region they differ according to where a person resides 

3) *What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney*

Prosecutors are government officials who are responsible for charging people with crimes and trying to prove their guilty in court. An attorney on the other hand is a private and legal professional who represent clients In a wide range of legal matters including criminal cases.

4) *Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, corporate or criminal and why*
I have interest in pursuing the branch of civil law. I have a desire to help people resolve their legal disputes and I would also like to venture into civil law as it provides an opportunity for me to use problem skills and critical thinking to resolve disputes .

5) *What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example*

I have great research, analytical and problem solving skills for example
let's say an issue on poverty arises in my community. I would first gather the data about the poverty rate from the government agencies statistics. Then look at the possible causes of poverty such as lack of education and job opportunities and identify groups that are most likely to be affected such as the children and elderly. After that I could examine the potential solutions such as increasing access to education or job training for the unemployed.

05/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, it will be past our available hours by that time, may I know if your parents are available to connect with us now?

05/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes that's correct
05/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am ready
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I agree
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes she had discussed about the registration fee with me
05/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we are
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I have
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I understand
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 284 0139: Hie how are you
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 284 0139: Sorry for connecting late
05/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 284 0139: I'm redemption's father
05/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263772840139 thank you for asking, I am doing great and I hope you are doing well too. That is alright please, I am happy to connect with you now.
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I'm glad to know  that the EWYL program reduces the financial burdern
05/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I have no querries , i have understood
05/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 284 0139: Thank you so much for the useful information you are sharing with us. As a family we are so grateful for this opportunity and will play our part to make this journey  successful
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 597 8719: My family and I are  actually excited for  the offer letter that is to come within the period of  three to five times you have mentioned , and upon receiving the offer letter I'll be motivated and as you have mentioned be  driven by the desire to secure my scholarship seat
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You're very welcome, and I'm glad to hear that the information has been helpful to you and your family. It's wonderful to see your enthusiasm and gratitude for the opportunity that lies ahead. Your positive attitude and determination will undoubtedly play a crucial role in your journey towards securing the scholarship seat.
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I am done reviewing the benefits
05/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Redemption, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 597 8719: So in short you are saying the the Endowment plan allows a student to secure a seat in a university
05/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now moving ahead with the next point.

2. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes it does
05/10/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes it does
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I have followed the details
05/10/23, 5:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I would like you to provide me with more information on that
05/10/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am now clear  , thank you for giving the calcifications
05/10/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes that's true
05/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I agree
05/10/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am clear with this solution it really beneficial for a student who has not manager to pass the A level as he or she will still have the chance to rewrite his A level Examination  and be able to pursue his degree in 2025
05/10/23, 5:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Before we move forward I would like to ask one thing u had mentioned earlier that since the A level results are not out yet you will be using the previous academic reports rights so I want to ask how many passes do you take or consider when using the previous academic results
05/10/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am clear about this
05/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, the statement of entry is enough to generate your offer letter, however, once your results are out a minimum of 2E grades is necessary and if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

I hope we are clear here?
05/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we are clear thank you for clarifying
05/10/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I am also clear on this one
05/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I do not have any queries
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am really excited to go to the next steps and I am also for my offer letter. And my parents are also happy to initiate the process <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263775978719 With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Thank you for today's session and the information you have shared
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Redemption.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we are
16/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I'm clear with this and we can move forward
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we are
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am clear
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I stay in Karoi
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Ok my father will connect with him for the payment of the university registration fee
16/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee directly through Bank Transfer, if you wish to do the same with the registration fee, you can do that on the details mentioned in the offer letter, is that clear?
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes it is
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I have understood the fee components thank you for briefing them up
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Redemption!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Redemption!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Redemption!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 284 0139: Good evening. I'm now available
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, if I may ask, are you clear till here please?
20/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Redemption!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to response to me here yesterday, however, I believe due to some challenges that you may have faced, you were not able to connect with me. Now, on that note, can you please let me know if we can move ahead with our conversation now?
20/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 284 0139: We are facing network challenges this side
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, if I may ask, shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
20/10/23, 10:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772840139 May I know if we are still connected with each other here please?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: As it's getting late on my end, I'd like to schedule our next conversation for tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT. This will give us ample time to continue our discussion about the offer letter and map out the next steps in your admission process. I kindly request that you ensure your presence at the mentioned time to make the most of our session. Wishing you a good night, and I anticipate our conversation tomorrow.
21/10/23, 8:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Redemption!

I hope you had a restful night and are feeling refreshed today. I'm eager to continue our discussion about your offer letter and the next steps in your admission process. To ensure we make the most of our session, I kindly request that you confirm your availability at this time.
21/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 597 8719: Good morning.
I am now available
21/10/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
21/10/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 597 8719: Yes we can move on with our discussion
21/10/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we proceed, may I know if you are clear till here please?
21/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I am
21/10/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 597 8719: Yes I  understand now
21/10/23, 9:16 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 597 8719: I do not have any queries, you can go on and share the university insights with me please
21/10/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
21/10/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on Monday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
