30/09/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/09/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 660 9547: Okay that's noted
30/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 660 9547: Yess they are clear
30/09/23, 9:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/09/23, 9:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/09/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 660 9547: Noted
30/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 660 9547: I'm following.......
30/09/23, 9:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/09/23, 9:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 660 9547: I am clear on everything, understood
30/09/23, 9:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 660 9547: Yess we can proceed
30/09/23, 9:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/09/23, 9:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
30/09/23, 9:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
30/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 660 9547: Okay waiting........
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
30/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 660 9547: I think I have a problem, I'm currently not connected to the wifi
30/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 660 9547: But let me see if I can find data and watch them
30/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 660 9547: Okay noted, once I get data I will inform you
30/09/23, 9:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand, in that case, let us reconnect on Monday at 12:30 pm.
30/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 660 9547: Noted
30/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you for understanding my situation hope im not slowing the progress my apologies
30/09/23, 10:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, that is alright, please. Network challenge is something that is not in your hands.
30/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you
01/10/23, 11:39 pm - +263 78 660 9547: So I listened to these videos.

A little summary about my understanding, the first video I didn't quite get the lesson but I loved the next one, it was a message to every student who want to apply international to watch be on high alert for fake agents, an example was given about that student who paid 1000 and didn't go anywhere.
This makes Edoofa favorable because it's legit and doesn't take our education as a business but they are here to ensure clean application and higher education to us.

The Happy Holly festival impressed me indeed I always see it on television though I was looking forward to see some of the African learners celebrating it 

I also agree the line that African students are intelligent and have got full potential
01/10/23, 11:47 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I got to know the rules of the program that Students should  be teachable and open minded

The important rule was brought up that students I supposed to follow Edoofa's instructions, this is true because without following the rules of Edoofa one is not eligible to be under the program and their journey won't be easy.

I understood that the other reason why students are required to follow rules is the fact that Edoofa has worked with different schools, colleges and universities in India for so long now that it's been able to locate the best Institutes for Proud Edoofians and it is in these various universities that we find the Earn While You Learn programs which will be under program supervision.So we are encouraged to follow rules and stand a chance to qualify into these amazing Universities.
01/10/23, 11:50 pm - +263 78 660 9547: The last Video was clear and I understood about the importance of the SOP statement of purpose which us as students must fill with great concern since it will assure my place at University and mark my successful journey with Edoofa. Thank you!
03/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudzaishe

I hope you are in good health. I apologize for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday, which made it impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available to connect?
03/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Good afternoon.... Yess I'm currently available
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @~Kudzy Drey vutoi💧Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess noted sir
03/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

03/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay let's proceed
03/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

04/10/23, 7:29 am - +263 78 660 9547: Response to question #1
04/10/23, 8:09 am - +263 78 660 9547: 2) *Is there such a thing as social structure that constraints individual action, or is society nothing more than a figment of our imaginations?*

There is a social structure that constraints individual action, as all societies are designed to constrain individual behavior.
Societies are constructed to make rules individuals need to confom to for acceptance.Therefore societies are not imaginery structures. 

The social structures include primary and secondary agencies. These structures can have a significant impact on individual bahavior and can be viewed as constrains on individual actions.

Social structures in Sociology are the distinctive stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in a society interact and live together. By so doing the social structures constrain the choices of individuals and, in so doing they limit, guide, shape their behavior and actions.

More to it:the social constraints are often expressed through social norms, cultural expectations and legal regulations. They shape the behavior, choices and interactions with others, influencing how one think, feel and act in various social contexts.

According to Functionalism Theory, Social structure is essential because it creates order and predictability in a society (Parsons, 1951)It connects people to larger society through webbed parten of social relationships (thus, homeless people are at a disadvantage cause little connections).

Therefore there is a social structure that constraints individual action and society is not an imaginary figment.
04/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 660 9547: 3) *Please explain the relation between Sociology and Economics*.

Both of them are social sciences. 
Sociology is the science of social structure. It deals with the relationships of humans with society. 
Economics is a selection of social sciences that interprets the availability of resources in a society. 

Sociology is part of the social sciences that tells us about human conduct and its functions and effects in society. The interaction between humans and society brings changes that affect everyone in multiple ways. Whilst Economics deals with the wants, needs and demands of resources and their supply. The study of consumption pattern helps determine various aspects of society, such as inflation and wealth management. Therefore it shows that *Sociology* and *Economics* are interrelated and have immense significance in their analysis.

To further show the relation, we can consider topics such as *Economic Sociology*. 
Economic Sociology analyses economic events namely *inflation* , *market* , and *work* using sociological philosophy and theory. 

Sociology is dependent on Economics in various ways. Any event that happens in society is directly or indirectly influenced by Economics. Analyzing several social changes and problems in society requires economics to understand the patterns and find solutions. 

The relationship between *Sociology* and *Economics* is a complex yet close one. Without Economics, there is no basis for Sociology and without Sociology, economics would not make sense. 

As i mentioned above, the relationship between Sociology and Economics. The two have utmost significance in the respective fields of their study. Their correlation helps economics and sociologists to develop strategies to formulate solutions for the welfare of society. Therefore, all developmental programs and schemes require an in-depth evaluation of Sociology and Economics.
04/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 660 9547: 4) *What is the role of institutions in society - do they perform positive functions, or simply work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerless* ?

Institutions are part of the social order of society and they govern behavior and expectations of individuals.

Well, there are a number of different types of institutions but generally they consist of a group of people who have got together to establish and influence certain functions such as education, social housing, they are relevant to the society /community in which they live. 

Institutions perform positive functions institutions generally promote value consensus - One of the most important functions of social institutions is the creation of value consensus which is an agreement around shared values. Institutions promote order in society. 

Institutions simplify the actions and work of the individual. They provide a means to control society and people who constitute it. They maintain unity and harmony in society by providing unified patterns of behavior that is followed by all members despite diversities. 

Institutions axist to meet society's fundamental needs such as providing structure, guidance and order. Common examples of institutions include family, religion, education and government. 

In general, social institutions within a culture play a key role in its creation, upkeep, and transformation. 

However, institutions lead to racial descrimination. "Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or for those who have some property against those who have non at all.
04/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 660 9547: 5) *Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in-groups and out-groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.*

The primary group is usually made up of significant others, those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization, The best example of a primary group is the family. 

Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal for example school and an office. 

Most of us feel comfortable using the word "group" without giving it much thought. We might say a group of kids, students in a lecture hall or four siblings playing ball. 

The term group is an emorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings, from just two people (think about a "group project  " in school when you partner with another student). 

 *IN-GROUPS AND OUT-GROUPS* 

This concept was developed by *William Summer.* a Sociologist. In short in-groups is the group that an individual feels like she belong to, and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is. 

Whilst an Out-group conversely is a group someone do not belong to, often we may feel disdain or competition in relationships to an out group. 
Sport teams, unions and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups. 

In-groups end up practising ethnocentrism, racism, sexism, ageism and heterosexism. 
Often, in-groups can form within a secondary group, for example a workplace can have cliques of people, from senior executives who play golf together. That is primary and secondary groups and examples.

05/10/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes, I really appreciate it. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Sociology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you noted
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess that is correct
05/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I'm ready
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Noted
05/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Understood, but have concern where it accommodation costs.... isn't that the accommodation is part of the 2000 to 3000USD
05/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786609547 as we move ahead with our discussion all your queries will be covered, so please do not worry.
05/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay we can proceed
05/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay thank you
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Noted
05/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess he mentioned this... I'm following
05/10/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess we are on the same page, I'm now well aware of it
05/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 660 9547: This is very clear sir, I have taken note of the example
05/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm following
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay I'm clear on this
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay, so the university registration fee of 750USD covers all universities that I will be applying for, perhaps I will need to apply to 5 universities
05/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 660 9547: That's wonderful........
05/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 660 9547: That is well understood
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 660 9547: No questions
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that you have no queries. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess we a pleased
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay thank you, that's noted
05/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Sorry sir can I take you back a little bit.... the Acceptance letter from University i receive it this year?
05/10/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we move ahead you will understand your own question please do not worry.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay, just wanted clarity since I won't be having my A'level results until next year
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you
05/10/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand, however the statement of entry you provided will be enough for the university to generate your offer letter and rest will be clearer as we move ahead @263786609547
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 660 9547: 4)🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm done sire... this is exciting news, let's get into detail
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kudziashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Wow that is good
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Done reading that
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it does and that is fair I can say
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Absolutely sir...
05/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 660 9547: No no I don't have anything to inquire
05/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Can I please have information on that sir
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I know that very well
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I'm clear now. Thank you
05/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it will be impossible
05/10/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay I understood all the options, they are clear
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you thank you for sharing
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you I understand very well
05/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 660 9547: We can proceed
05/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm clear sir
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Let's proceed
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay thank you, that is a great step too... but I believe no one will want to give up on their dreams right kkkk
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 660 9547: No no I'm clear on that one
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess sir I'm sure they will be excited once they set their eyes on this session
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay sir Noted
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you for such a great session
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome Kudzaishe.
05/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 660 9547: As for the recommendation letter will try tomorrow
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please.

14/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you
14/10/23, 12:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, please go through these questions and answer them one by one so that we can move ahead with our discussion.
14/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 660 9547: 1) my tuition fee per semester after the Schoolarship is $900
14/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 660 9547: 2) The standard duration of my course is 3years (6 semesters).

With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it's clear sir
14/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
14/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
14/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay so if it's a 3  seater does it mean we will be 3 in a room or......
14/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, in the context of the on-campus accommodation options at Galgotias University, a "three-seater" room means that there will be three students sharing the same room. This type of accommodation is designed for three people to live together in the same room. Similarly, a "two-seater" room means it's intended for two students to share. I hope this is clear?
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it's clear
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 660 9547: What about the off campus are there any rooms to share like will I get to go half- half  on the rentals
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 660 9547: With another student
14/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: In off-campus accommodation options, you can often choose whether to share a room or not, depending on your preferences and the availability of such arrangements. Typically, off-campus accommodation is more flexible in terms of room sharing.

If you wish to share a room with another student to split the rent, and vice versa. I hope this is clear as well?
14/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it's clear sir, thank you.
14/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
14/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 660 9547: We are on the same page
14/10/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
14/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I'm clear on this one
14/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay so since it is crucial when is it payable
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess we are on the same page now. Thank you
14/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
14/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
14/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay noted
14/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm in Bulawayo
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
14/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm not residing in Harare sir
14/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I understand that. However, if you would be able to get the payment done from Harare with the help of a friend of relative, in that case you can use this mode. Otherwise, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
14/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I still have the details but you can share sir
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
14/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay thank you sir
14/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
14/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you for summing it up, the structure is okay with me
14/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 660 9547: My parents will also share their views on this group when they come online
14/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
14/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
14/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I'm clear on this
14/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 660 9547: That is well noted
14/10/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
14/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess I see my parents won't have to pay much as I will be able to sponsor my self
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
14/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 660 9547: There is part that says *The results are pending please submit before registration or they letter will be canceled*

They mean before registration next year right?
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is absolutely right. This means that you would have to submit your A-Level Results before your registration when you will arrive here in India. I hope this is clear?
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yess it's clear
14/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you wish to ask?
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 660 9547: What if a student fails to pay the Admission and Procedure fee in 15days and the offer letter get canceled what then happens
14/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the the university will revoke the offer letter, and then the student won't be able to take admission there again. I hope you understand?
14/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Yeah. So if it gets revoked will I be able to get admission in another University or.....
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudzaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please in that situation, you won't be able to take admission in that particular university again please.

16/10/23, 11:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
16/10/23, 11:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?

With warm regards,
