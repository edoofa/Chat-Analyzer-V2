For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/08/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes we may
29/08/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Done
29/08/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Very clear
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Noted
29/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Greetings to you all.
29/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes following
29/08/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/08/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Noted

29/08/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry about that right now. We shall certainly work on alternatives. Please let me know if we are still on the same page?
29/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes, please proceed
29/08/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. We shall now be moving forward with the first step which is the *Message from the founder’s office*. May I know if you are ready?
29/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we are ready
29/08/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/08/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

31/08/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes I am ready.
31/08/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
31/08/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Sir I watched them
31/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we managed to watch them
31/08/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, dear. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
31/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok sir
31/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 401 4355: As far as I understood. Edoofa requires the student to follow instructions and be teachable and open minded.By doing that the student will make it easy for Edoofa to help him/her along the road to success.I also understood that does not only get the student affordable quality education and making students employable though the Student of Edoofa Earning and Learning  to success programme but its also focused on increasing student's capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent. I understood that Edoofa admits you into universities to make you employers through scholarships, the EWYL programme  and making education affordable for the student.Moreover I understood that Edoofa's vision is to guide,mentor and show the student the path to achieve success.Moving on Edoofa has a list of Universities where Edoofians go U.G.C ( University Grants Commission in India) being one of the many. The Indian Culture is preserved as festivals are done in these Universities for example 'Holi'. Edoofa founders encourage students to understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time over 10 years to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. They encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and ne qualified for these prestigious institutions.Lastly I understood about the Statement of Purpose (SOP) which is an essential document that convinces the school why you are worth to be enrolled. As I understood,It should include the student's goals,visions,academic progress,why you have chosen the programme and why you are seeking admission in that particular school.Also students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form.
31/08/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
31/08/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
31/08/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.
31/08/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
31/08/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
31/08/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Sir
31/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
31/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 PM.
31/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

01/09/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Memory. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Yes, please you may ask.
01/09/23, 11:54 am - +263 71 401 4355: Sir my internet connection is very poor and I was asking if by chance you could extend my submission time please
01/09/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, Memory. May I know by when you might be able to submit the documents?
01/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 401 4355: By excactly  5pm sir

01/09/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That works as well, Memory.
01/09/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are indeed required to record audio for question 1 of the academic questions. For the rest of the questions, you have the choice to compile them into a document or share the answers in text format here within the group.

01/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 401 4355: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that rights ares claims of an individual that are essential for the development of his or her own self and are recognized by society or the state whereas duties are moral obligations or commitments that people perform accordingly to conventions, regulations or moral rules. Furthermore the difference in human rights and civil rights is that human rights that are applicable to all humans regardless their identity but simply because they are human, whether or not they have been put into the form of a law in the country where you reside. These are the most fundamental rights and considered to be the necessities for human existence. They overlap to a large degree with civil liberties and include the rights to free expression, fair trial, and education, as well as the right to protection from torture.However civil rights are often granted by a government.They are often restricted to a certain group of people exhibit the right to vote.Civil rights also vary around the world. They're guarantees of equal social opportunities and protection under the law, regardless of race, religion, or other characteristics.
01/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 401 4355: 3.The difference  between a prosecutor and an attorney is that an attorney is a lawyer who practises as a  professional advisor or advocate in legal matters whereas a prosecutor determines whether to charge an individual for a crime that person's guilt in court.A prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client’s innocence. An attorney represents a client in court. In a civil matter an attorney may represent the claimant or the respondent and in a criminal case, the attorney may defend the prosecution or the defendant. An attorney clarify legal concerns, counsel clients on disputes involving them and conduct depth investigation cases including examining official records like police reports. However prosecutor defend prosecution in court and serves the US legal system.A prosecutor works for the state. In all cases involving criminal charges, a prosecutor speaks on behalf of the state.
01/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 401 4355: 4.I am interested in  pursuing Criminal law. This focuses on providing a society with a set of rules regarding legal and illegal behavior.I want to pursue in Criminal law because they are many people who are failing to stand up for themselves and end up in prisons for crimes they did not commit. So given the opportunity I want to help such people.I want to be able to outline what actions and behaviours are allowed and be able to define what actions are crimes and how to punish people who commit these crimes. I want victims of crime to see perpetrators forced to take responsibility for their actions. They may even see financial compensation for their injuries and suffering.The consequences for crime outlined within criminal law are designed to discourage others from engaging in similar behaviors hence through that I'll be able to maintain peace and prevent others from doing crime. The idea of having to pay fines, report to a probation officer, or spend time in jail can be the drive behind another person's will to avoid particular actions. While people hope that others will act out of a sense of the greater good, this is not always the case, and laws and punishments designed by criminal law can help keep citizens' behavior in line.In restricting the freedom of those convicted of a crime, whether through incarceration, probation, or no-contact orders, criminal law can help protect society and rehabilitate criminals hence my motives will be achieved. Incapacitation guarantees that those known to break the law are away from people and situations that may encourage them to commit crimes. It may also lead those involved in criminal activity to reconsider their behavior and avoid future crimes to avoid further incarceration or limitation of movement.
01/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
01/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 401 4355: 5. I belive I have critical thinking and analytical skills that will make me a successful laywer. These skills will help me succeed in my career as they define the aptitude of a lawyer and will make me ever important with experience. My paying attention to detail is also important, as lawyers must possess the skill of paying attention to detail in order to compile a fool-proof case.My  skill of legal reasoning is also important because lawyers must be able to form a strong argument I court, I have good powers of logical reasoning to analyse and conclude every situation correctly. I believe I am able to infer possible conclusions from premises and obtain a relation between them to argue logically in court. Taking for example my participation in public speaking activities and being in the school  debate team where we have to pay attention to detail inorder to solve a certain case. These skills will make me a very successful lawyer.

01/09/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Laws and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
01/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Its accurate sir
01/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
01/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Sir
01/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
01/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes
01/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
01/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
01/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
01/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes sir
01/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
01/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Sir
01/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
01/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
01/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
01/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Sir
01/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
01/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $750 = $600. This amount can be paid in two installments of $300 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
01/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear here as well.
01/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Very clear
01/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Very clear Sir
01/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
01/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
01/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 401 4355: No Sir

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Good afternoon sir
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes please
06/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Afternoon sorry for late response.lets begin
06/09/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 447 7577: No please enlighten us
06/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended.
06/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, Memory. let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Following...
06/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
06/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
06/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
06/09/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
06/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 447 7577: No sir
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
06/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 447 7577: I have read the benefits
06/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
06/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
06/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Very clear
06/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/09/23, 3:14 am - +263 77 447 7577: Yes sir
07/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we can proceed
07/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
07/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes following
07/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Please enlighten  us
07/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
07/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
07/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
07/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes very clear. Thank you
07/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
07/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
07/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
07/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes very clear
07/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2023, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2024, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2023 itself.
07/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes sir
07/09/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Alright sir
08/09/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Memory,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Afternoon sir., yes am ready
09/09/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today? <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 820 5526: We are doing fine thank you.
09/09/23, 11:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Shall we proceed further with the session?
09/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes please
09/09/23, 12:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/09/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Following...
09/09/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Okay I understand.
09/09/23, 12:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 820 5526: No queries, everything is clear.
09/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Very clear
09/09/23, 12:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Okay.Thank you. stay blessed.
11/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Memory. How are you doing this lovely evening?
11/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Good evening
11/09/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 447 7577: We are fine thanks and you
11/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am great too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Let's proceed
11/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Memory, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
11/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes I have
11/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
12/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Good afternoon to you all.Before I comment on the benefits of the Scholarship  quantum.Please note that Memory is at boarding school and does not have a phone because they are not allowed there. I and Aux will be at work.So, please bear with us as we might not be able to reply you on time.
We had the discussion and found the early decision program beneficial to both us and Memory since it caters for all outcomes of final A-level results.It gives us hope as parents regarding our child's academic journey since it gives students time to reappear in A level exams or persue a diploma under same program.We agree on the terms and we are happy with the $150 grant as it reduces financial burden on us as parents.
12/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Mrs. Farai. That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
13/09/23, 11:54 am - +263 71 820 5526: Good morning.Thank you for asking but as for now I have no queries, everything is well explained.
13/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Memory. How are you doing today?
13/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 447 7577: We are fine thanks and you
13/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine too, thank you for asking, I belive you might be Aux, Memory's sister?
13/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes sir
13/09/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is nice to connect with you Aux. Shall we proceed with the session?
13/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes lets proceed
13/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for your sister's next steps.*
13/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes am very much aware of the next step
13/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
13/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $1200 to $1800. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
13/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we are on the same page
13/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
13/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
13/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
13/09/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes very clear
13/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your sister's university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same? <This message was edited>
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes please
13/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
14/09/23, 4:58 am - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we on the same page
14/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 820 5526: Good morning.we are following
14/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Memory.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
14/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Good evening
14/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we are available
14/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With the continuation of our session. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
14/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes the two admission procedures are very clear
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Good morning.I've understood that in Early Registration/University Admission process the student will be eligible to all 6 early decision benefits including early decision grant of $150.Along with this, you will also have a payment plan for the registration fee.The  fee will be payable in two parts, the first payment of half of the fee should be done within 15 days and the other part should be payed within the remaining part of the month. Failure to meet the deadline means no place will be reserved for you by the university.
And, Starndard procedures. Here, you will be given only 15 days to complete the payment and you are required to pay up before the deadline.
15/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 820 5526: And also the universities are very strict about their deadlines.
15/09/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Memory. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Good evening sir
15/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we may proceed
15/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
15/09/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes it's clear
15/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
15/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *3rd October* and *3rd November*.
15/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Memory’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes we are comfortable..
Please go ahead

16/09/23, 11:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Memory’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
16/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 820 5526: Yes, we are prepared
16/09/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Memory’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Memory’s higher education well.
16/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 820 5526: Alright, thank you. Stay blessed.
16/09/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Memory. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:09 am - +263 77 447 7577: Good morning
20/09/23, 8:09 am - +263 77 447 7577: Thank you
20/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 820 5526: Thank so much, we are happy with the progress.
20/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 820 5526: Thank you so much*
20/09/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so happy about the offer letter please. Moving ahead, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes, we have gone through the letter.
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 447 7577: 1. $900
2. 5 years 
3.$300
4. $750
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 820 5526: 1. $900
2. 5 years
3. $300
4. $750
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please thank you for sharing. May I know if you are clear till here?
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 447 7577: Yes  very clear
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 820 5526: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Okay.we understand it
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Following
20/09/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Very clear, please proceed
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Very clear
20/09/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes,we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Currently I'm staying in Bindura
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 820 5526: But Harare is not too far from Bindura.
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Noted with thanks
20/09/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes, please send the details again
20/09/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

20/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800 <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 820 5526: If I may ask, is it wise to opt for off campus accommodation for a child who is just arriving foreign country.l'm just worried as a parent for security reasons.
20/09/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is indeed a very good question. On that note, I would like to mention that, for us here at Edoofa, the safety of our students is always a top priority and that is why we ensure that the universities that we partner with have all the measures in place to ensure the safety of our students. They have dedicated campus security personnel and teams, CCTV surveillance systems, and strict access control to ensure a safe environment within the university premises.

Along with that, we here at Edoofa take the welfare of all the students who arrive here in India so seriously that we also have a dedicated Department of Student Welfare that is set up specially to take care of all the students who will arrive here in India and make sure that their academic journey after coming here is a smooth one with them having the best university experience. I hope this is clear now?
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Okay, so if you choose off campus that means you should aslo include transport costs on top of accommodation and food.
20/09/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. When it comes to the transport costs, there won't be any since all the off-campus facilities are located at a walking distance from the campus please.
20/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Sorry for taking you back a bit.I was checking on the deposit we made last time.We made the deposit to Mr Shorwi's account not Charles Jerera.

20/09/23, 4:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, excuse me for the confusion here. Let me share Mr. Shorwi's details as well with you here.

20/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Very clear
20/09/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Yes, I have noticed that.
21/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Memory!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 447 7577: No queries sir
21/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
21/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to follow up regarding the recent payment made for the remaining balance of $333. As per our records, the payment was initiated to Mr. Shorwi's account. However, there has been a change in Mr. Shorwi's Account Details and therefore, there is a possibility that the payment could have been canceled.

To ensure everything is in order, could you please check with your bank to verify if the payment to Mr. Shorwi's account has been successfully processed? If there are any complications or if the payment hasn't gone through, we kindly request you to do that again on the updated account details of Mr. Shorwi, I am sharing that for you here.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 7:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
