06/10/23, 3:04 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we can connect now
06/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am ready and available
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted and very clear, but can you allow me for one or two questions please
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please @265991739605 ?
06/10/23, 3:27 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: 1-- I would like to know how long does it take for one to make that application Scholarship

2---And after that application how long do the Edoofa team take to submit to Univerties

3--Do the Edoofa team assist or take part for choosing University to an individual
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: BRIFLY can you shde me abit of light the cost (Amount) on following 

1--Annual tuition(in dollars)
2--Accomodation costs
3--University registration fee
 
I know all of these will be on our offer letter but I just want  have a picture
06/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries, let me help you understand Yes please once we complete step 4 of the admission process we shall share your application with the universities, and we do assist you in choosing the best university for Patrick as per his preference and for the remaining queries I would encourage you to be patient since each and every query of yours will be covered as we move ahead with our discussion?
06/10/23, 3:51 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted and I will be patient enough
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know so shall we start with our discussion?
06/10/23, 4:21 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we can
06/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear here?
06/10/23, 4:39 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am very clear
06/10/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
06/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
06/10/23, 7:55 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Very clear. Amount of $500 to $750 is paid in order to secure Scholarship seat as registration fee and has to be settled while in home country.

And once arrives in India the amount is adjusted within their first-year fee effectively reducing to zero
06/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
06/10/23, 8:37 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we are together
06/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted and let calculate into Malawi currency
06/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
06/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/10/23, 9:05 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Better now, I wz looking for this example this well explained ,I can now have a picture of wat will happen next
06/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/10/23, 4:23 am - +265 991 73 96 05: This is better, now relieved .My focus now will be on paying University registration
07/10/23, 7:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Patrick.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/10/23, 8:11 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we can connect
07/10/23, 8:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that so may I know if you are clear so far?
07/10/23, 8:44 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Very clear and let assure you that we are moving together
07/10/23, 8:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 9:19 am - +265 991 73 96 05: No any queries we are moving togather
07/10/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Patrick, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 6:33 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Following
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes it is resonate and clear
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes and I have liked it so much
09/10/23, 7:22 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: This will abit ease in payment
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 9:30 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: That's great ,very considerate,,, big hand to the EDOOFAINS 👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
09/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yeah can you go ahead, provide us with more information
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Praise to the Endowment plan and thanks the EDOOFAINS
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 3:30 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Morning , so far no queries
10/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patrick. 

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am ready to be  connected
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
10/10/23, 2:22 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am clear
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As Patrick's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Patrick is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 3:18 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am very excited about it and it's my prayer that my son should secure the remaining 63 seat
10/10/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, definitely with the great result, he will be able to secure a seat. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 3:37 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted and thank you so much
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patrick.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:47 am - +265 999 10 45 20: Patrick is from Malawi not Zimbabwe
14/10/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here, stay assured that I will get it corrected from the side of the university. For now, please go through the letter and then we will discuss the same at the time of our session.
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: God is gud, this is great news to hear,  am very excited and am over the moon.

Thanks so much the Edoofa team for ur effort ,I can see the light through the tunnel.

I will be available around 04.30 pm Cat for the session
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!

Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 3:55 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patrick!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 9:51 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes i go through it and am ready for the session
15/10/23, 9:58 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Good morning
15/10/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:13 am - +265 991 73 96 05: (1) Per semester the tuition fee after Schorship is 900USD

(2) The stardad duration of the course is 4years (8 Semester)

(3) Tha Admission and procedure fee is 300 USD 

(4) The registration  fee is 750 USD
15/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:55 am - +265 991 73 96 05: It's clear that is to say per semester we will be paying 900 USD and a nnually will be 1800 ,that is one year  which is egual to two semester
15/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is very right! Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 12:08 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted that the accommodation is separate and has been categorised according to stardad
15/10/23, 12:09 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: So 2000 USD accommodation is it per semester?
15/10/23, 12:12 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: For a private or sharing apartment do you guide them or do you assist to find for them
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these queries with me here. Now, when it comes to the on-campus accommodation, the cost of $2000 is for the entire year please. 

Moving ahead, coming to the private accommodation option, yes please, the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will assist you in finding the same please. I hope this is clear now?
15/10/23, 9:29 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Sorry for that and i wish you well.
I have  a lot of queries and observation can you allow me to express them
15/10/23, 9:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the wish ☺️. Yes, please we will discuss all the queries that you have moving ahead. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
15/10/23, 9:37 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am clear
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Though some where some how needs proper clarification
15/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 9:46 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Following and we are together
15/10/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well? <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 10:49 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes the examination fees is $100 and for 2 semester
15/10/23, 10:52 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am clear on that but on Tuition can you clarify abit
15/10/23, 10:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:56 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Can you came again on this one Admission & procedure fee of $ 300 and Registration which is $ 750
Which one should be paid earlier ?

And which one should be paid within 15days  to reserve schorship seat
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, the $300 admission fee has been waived off since you do not have to pay that now. Moving ahead, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 11:11 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Very clear and i have recalled very well,, instead of $750 am supposed to pay $600 as a registration fee in order to reserve schorship seat which can be paid in stallment the first one $300 to paid b4 28/10/23 and the last one to be paid $300 before November 2023
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is very right. Moving ahead, let us come to the payment mode. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
16/10/23, 11:39 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am following
16/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 12:09 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: But before we proceed let me remaind you and the Gaigotias University team to  change the Country which my Son Patrick junior Mwalambula belong as soon as possible because i would like to use it to the Registration Buraue so that i can get the ID for Patrick.

The Country should read MALAWI NOT ZIMBABWE PLEASE
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we will get it updated from the side of the university please.
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Following
16/10/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
16/10/23, 3:22 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: At least better
16/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes i have few queries 

1. After you applied for Patrick's university, is this the only University which considered his application?

2. Is this Galgotias  university rated to be among the best universities in India? Do parents don't have a say to the choice of university.

3. From now, are we only supposed to pay registration fee here at home to secure university seat ?

4. After registration is done ,the other fees are supposed to be settled there in India or can be paid here as well.
Can you assist me wat are other fees to be paid here before india and when?

5. Wat is Tuition fee?  is it like university fee 

--Coz we have tuition fee (Per semester) which is $ 1800

-----And  we have Scholarship on Tuition fee (Per semester) which is 50%

---Lastly Tuition fee after Scholarship (per semester) which is 900

When is this tuition fee supposed to be settled
17/10/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here please. On that note, I would be happy to help you with these queries, for that, shall we move ahead to discuss that now?
17/10/23, 2:04 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes go ahead am available now
17/10/23, 4:14 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Still waiting
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for the first query of yours, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here?
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am clear, you can go ahead
17/10/23, 4:50 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am waiting
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/10/23, 7:27 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted
18/10/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 6:41 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Am not aware
19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Patrick!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am sorry, i saw the commutation very late why, can't we make it tomorrow 1500hrs ,i will be very free
19/10/23, 11:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, shall we move ahead with that now?
20/10/23, 1:35 am - +265 991 73 96 05: I was meaning to have session tomorrow afternoon 15:00hrs
20/10/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
20/10/23, 12:41 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes go ahead
20/10/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we proceed, if I may ask, are you clear till here?
20/10/23, 12:45 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am clear
20/10/23, 12:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/10/23, 12:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/10/23, 12:54 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we are togather
20/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear about how the admission process is carried out right?
20/10/23, 12:55 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes ido understand
20/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, if I may ask do you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
20/10/23, 1:17 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes before we proceed i need that offer later changed quickly so that i can use it to proceess that ID

They need a proof if i want to pay registration fee
20/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well please. Can you come again and let me know what do you want?
20/10/23, 1:37 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: The offer latter which the Galgotias University sent is bearing Patrick as if is from Zimbabwe but Patrick is from Malawi

So assist us that it should be changed so that i can use it to get patrick's ID and pay the registration fee
20/10/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, you can stay assured that we have already notified the university of the same and once we receive an update, we will let you know. Moving ahead, you can proceed to make the payment without that as well, I believe there won't be any issue in that, right?
20/10/23, 1:43 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Ok noted
20/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask by when are you planning to make the payment please?

20/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, shall we move ahead to conclude our discussion here regarding the offer letter as well?
20/10/23, 2:27 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes we can go ahead
20/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Before we do that, if I may ask do you have any other queries to ask please?
20/10/23, 3:10 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: After registration are we going settle other bills right there in india
20/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Once the registration is done, rest all the other expenses will be required once Patrick is here in India please. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 3:42 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Very clear
20/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Any other queries that you may still have please?
20/10/23, 4:27 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Suppose ur having some financial problems in course of the journey ,do we considered or given abit of time to look for it
20/10/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please clarify, if you are mentioning about the registration process or about the situation when Patrick will be here in India?
20/10/23, 5:31 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Meaning other situation while in india not registration here
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if god forbid you may face any financial difficulty while Patrick's studies will be going on here in India, then you do not have to think about being alone in that situation, we will be there ready to support you till the end. 

As you are aware that once the students arrive here in India, Edoofa is their local parent and we take that responsibility very seriously, hence, making sure that we provide the parents with the required solution in such times. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 9:27 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Bravo Edoofa nice to here that

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 09:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 10:10 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes Ms Milan am ready for the discussion
25/10/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, before we move ahead, do you have any queries with respect to the admission process as of now?
25/10/23, 10:16 am - +265 991 73 96 05: No queries so far ,just to inform you that i will settle the whole registration fees at once before 28 November 2023
25/10/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before we move ahead, do you have any other queries or concerns that you wish to share regarding the offer letter from Galgotias Univeristy please?
25/10/23, 10:25 am - +265 991 73 96 05: 1--Can it be possible to explain  more about Tuition fee

2-- You say per semester we will paying 50% is it ?
25/10/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you in understanding about that again:

*Tuition Fee*: Tuition fee, in this context, refers to the cost of your academic instruction at Galgotias University. In your offer letter, it is mentioned that your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is $900. So, you will be paying $900 for each semester of your course.

*Payment*: Yes, you are correct. You will be paying 50% of the tuition fee for each semester, which would be $900. 

I hope this is understood now, right?
25/10/23, 10:38 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Wat is the duration of the semester ,i mean i want to know hw many months per semester (first semester)
25/10/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: The duration of a semester at Galgotias University, like at most universities, is typically around 5 to 6 months. It's the standard time frame for one academic term. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 10:43 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Now upon stepping at Galgotias University we are suppose to pay tuition fee of about $900 for the first semester?
25/10/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. However, there is a change in that, since Patrick is an Edoofian and if you may recall that it is one of the benefits of being an Edoofian that the registration fee will be adjusted in the first year tuition fee, this means that once the registration fee would be paid, then the $750 will be adjusted in the first semester fee, which means the balance that you would have to pay upon arriving here in India would be:

$900 - $750 = $150. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 11:28 am - +265 991 73 96 05: I thought the registration fee of $750 has already been adjusted to $600

Then the correct mathmatics would be 
$900-$600=$300 this should be answer on tuition fee for the first semester

Correct me if am lost
25/10/23, 12:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: It seems there might have been some misunderstanding, and I appreciate your patience in seeking clarification. You are indeed correct that the registration fee of $750 has been adjusted to $600. However, it's important to note that Edoofa is providing a $150 grant towards your registration fee, which means you only have to pay $600, but when it comes to the balance tuition fee, $750 will be adjusted to the same. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 12:34 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Now am very clear

$900-$750=$150 this would be the tuition fee for the first semester
25/10/23, 12:35 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: You can go ahead Ms.
25/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. May I know if you have any other queries to ask please?
25/10/23, 1:18 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: The tuition fee for the whole program(8 Semester ) will be $1200 am i collect ?
25/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here, can you please come again and let me know of the same again?
25/10/23, 5:26 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: No i don't have any
25/10/23, 7:07 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 7:07 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 7:08 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Be informed that Patrick's NATIONAL ID is finally out ,you can check above👆
26/10/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: We talk at length about the opportunity given at Galgotias University

We talked about the offordability of the university through the EDOOFAINS 

We talked about the way Galgotias University looks
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 4:42 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: You can proceed
26/10/23, 5:01 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am sorry for responding late we are experiencing network problem here
27/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 3:32 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Thanks for being open to me ,i promise to reach you as soon as i came across any Challenge which can hinder my progress
30/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 10:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had here earlier, you were planning to make the payment of Patrick's registration fee by 28th October, however, I have not received an update from your side on that. 

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
31/10/23, 3:06 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Good morning ,i did not make the payment before 28 October .

If you remember, i asked you to consider me to make a single payment of $600 before 28 November 2023.

Good morning.
31/10/23, 5:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 5:19 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Afternoon ,yes we are doing great Ms Milan
31/10/23, 5:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, regarding what you have said above, I would like to know the reason that you wish to make the payment by 28th November, while the university had already given you the date of 28th October for making the payment please?
31/10/23, 5:37 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: If you can recall very well ,i asked you to communicate with the Galgotias University to amend or to make the correction on Country which Patrick Mwalambula comes from on the offer latter 

This will help me to show it to the National Registration Breuae here in Malawi so that they process his ID which can be used to the Bank when making registration payments to the University
31/10/23, 11:12 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: My apologies if this may cause inconvenience
01/11/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand, Patrick. You're absolutely right; I do recall the discussion regarding the country detail on the offer letter and I have already shared the same information with the university officials. 

However, moving ahead, when it comes to making the payment I believe you could have made that with the help of your ID as well, right?
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Noted and very true we could have used my ID .

So before it's too late , can we restify and solve this problem to avoid losing our university seat what should we do right now

Can you assist Ms Sign Milan Singh
01/11/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding by when is the earliest that you can make the payment now?
01/11/23, 3:34 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: The earliest to make that payment of $300 can be on Tuesday the 7th November 2023 and finish the remaining $300 on 21th November 2023
01/11/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, are you certain about doing the same please?

However, after deducting the transfer charges, the amount reflected here was $285, therefore, this leaves you with a balance of $15 that is to be paid in order for the completion of the registration fee. I hope this is understood?
20/11/23, 3:40 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Good afternoon Team,
Sorry for the late response, wat you have said about the balance can be true this can be either we miss calculated or due to the devalution of our Money here .

So without delay I will send the $25 soon, but let me find out if I can use the same offer latter when paying or wait for another one
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: But on the other hand I blame the Bank officials coz they were suppose to deduct the right amount from my account avoid these problems
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Patrick!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 11:50 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Thanks for the information Ms. Milan Singh and all the best

Welcome Ms. Ashi. I think everything is in your records meaning to say Ms. Ashi will continue where you and us left before you exchange.

More especially now when we are  rectifying the payment of registration fee.

Am more than happy to resume our education journey with with Ms. AShi from Wednesday on wards and I promise to cooperate .

MWALAMBULA SNR.
22/11/23, 8:54 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: The second payment done on 18th November 23 so am thinking that   before I pay the $15 to cover balance of $285 ($600) let's wait if also the second payment has the same problem so that i can settle them togather

My account has no problem to be deducted the agreed amount but I don't understandwat is happening to our Bank here.
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Patrick,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

24/11/23, 4:44 am - +265 991 73 96 05: Can you clarify clearly wat is the next stage after registration Ms.Ashi.

Am not clear about about application from Lovely professional University and the updates and that another offer letter
24/11/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patrick, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

Sure dear, Let me help you in understanding that the payment you made towards your registration fees has left the balance of $15 after deducting the transfer charges, therefore this leaves you with the balance of amount $15 that is to be paid to complete your registration at the university, I hope this is understood?
24/11/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding your concern about your application at  Lovely professional University, Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
24/11/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU,  you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Are you clear on this?
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Good afternoon ,

So meaning that it's only $15 money remaining to settle out of total registration fee of $600 paid.

If I pay $15 that means am done with registration fee?
24/11/23, 4:16 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Yes am very clear but the question is am not familiar with your universities there ,I will just rely your guidance ,your assistance in chosing the best university.

Our hope as Mwalambula family is to see our Child getting gud education in india so your assistance will highly appreciated.

If you can advise us to change we will change if you can advise us to maintain Galgotias University we will proceed.

Thanks..
