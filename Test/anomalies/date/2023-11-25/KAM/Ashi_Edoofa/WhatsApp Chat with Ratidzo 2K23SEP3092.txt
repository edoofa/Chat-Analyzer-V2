Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders.

18/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 835 5243: For us who never been in India we don't know anything about the University but under edoofa program they have all information of each and every school, qualities of them

All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.

18/10/23, 10:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
18/10/23, 10:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions.

19/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 835 5243: 2) *How do you see your country's development and how can you contribute to it*

Zimbabwe suffered serious economic contractions in 2019 and 2020 due to the economic mismanagement, the extended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate shocks that crippled agriculture and electricity generation. According to the government of Zimbabwe, the economy recovered strongly, growing by 7.8 percent, in 2021 although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the economy grew by 6.1 percent, because of increased agricultural production, high commodity prices, and improved capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector. A gap between the auction and parallel-market exchange rates has persisted, with U.S. dollars more than twice as expensive on the parallel market.

To improve the ease of doing business, the government formed the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) in 2020, intended as a one-stop-shop to promote and facilitate both domestic and foreign investment in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s incentives to attract FDI include tax breaks for new investment by foreign and domestic companies, and making capital expenditures on new factories, machinery, and improvements fully tax deductible. The government waives import taxes and surtaxes on capital equipment. It has made gradual progress in improving the business environment by reducing regulatory costs, but policy inconsistency and weak institutions have continued to frustrate businesses. Corruption remains rife and there is little protection of property rights, particularly with respect to agricultural land. Historically, the government has committed to protect property rights but has also expropriated land without compensation.As an environmentalist an integration process helps through do no harm, mitigate environmental related risks especially those posed by climate change such as drought, flooding and extremely weather related events. This mitigation measures will be integrated into strategies, policies and programming in order to safeguard investments and results achieved. Environmental challenges are making the relationship between environmental sustainability and poverty reduction stronger. So are new economic opportunities related to green growth and technology.
 3) *What is the relationship between humans and their environment* ?

 Humans need to interact with the environment to obtain our food, water, fuel, medicines, building materials and many other things.For example humans have been cutting down forest to clear land to grow crops for centuries and by doing the environment will be altered.A good climate accessible clean water, fertile soil are aspects of the physical environment that enables people to live and thrive. However harsh environments such as very hot climate, limited water and infertile land, make it difficult for people to survive. Advances in science and technology have helped us to exploit the environment for our benefit, through industrialization but we have also introduced pollution and caused environmental damage and greater exploitation of resources. The impact of environmental problems on humans is significant, affecting all human activities, including health and socio-economic development. The links between the two are complex and varied. Humans plays both positive and negative roles in the environment and the environment also do the same.
 *4)How and why are places connected with one another?*
 Places in geography are connected to each other through various modes of transportation like roads, railways, airways, waterways, and digital communication networks.In geography, connectivity means the degree to which different places are interrelated with each other. It involves a set of linkages, which may be physical, economic, social or digital, that are formed between different locations.Connectivity is significant for trade, tourism, communication, and mobility between different places of the world. Physical connectivity includes the movement of goods, services, and people. Economic connectivity includes the exchange of goods and services, investment, and financial flows. Social connectivity includes cultural interactions, migration, and population movements.As people are more exposed to more cultures, languages. Digital connectivity involves communication and information flows, including the use of the internet, social media, and telecommunications.It includes globalisation whereby world's local and regional economies, societies and cultures have become intergrated together through a global network of and this process undoubtedly has a major impact upon places connectivity.

5 *) Explain GIS and it's importance*
 It is a collection of computer software and information which is used for viewing, analysing, managing and displaying geographical data.In general, it allows users to search for information about specific geographical areas, analyse spatial information, edit the data and create maps, charts and reports that show users the results in visual forms.GIS helps users to find answers to their questions and solve the problems by presenting data in simple visual ways.

The importance of using a geographic information system include:
 
Improved decision making– decisions are made easier because specific and detailed information is presented about one or more locations.
Reduce costs and increase efficiency – especially regarding maintenance schedules, fleet movements or scheduling timetables.
Improved communication between any involved organisations or departments as the visual format is easily understood by all.Easy recordkeeping – geographical changes are easily recorded by GIS for those responsible of recording the changes.Managing geographically – knowing what is and will be occurring in a geographic space in order to plan a course of action.

19/10/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 835 5243: My network is not uploading audio can I keep on trying
19/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Am I suppose to complete it today or tomorrow since am starting tomorrow
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You can message in your EWYL Group today, @263778355243.
19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *MA (Geography)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes you are correct
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes I do understand
19/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
19/10/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Following
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Does that mean $750 is needed once there's no room for payment plan for this?
19/10/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243 You will get a better clarity as we proceed with the session.
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted Thank you
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
19/10/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 835 5243: I don't have a question so far am waiting for clarity on payments plan you mentioned before. I will be glad to get it on our next stage
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263778355243,Please be assured that your query will be attended soon
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/10/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Received thank you
19/10/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome Ratidzo. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.


Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Sure thank you
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Great news indeed
19/10/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 6:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ratidzo, you as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Following
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Well explained
19/10/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes but I have a question on this so how does the EWYL  also assist. Does it have any contribution here
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243 Your EWYL Credits are used to pay your University fees, the registration fees is paid by you only.
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted Thank you
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome,
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 835 5243: It's clear now
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 835 5243: No question so far
19/10/23, 7:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263778355243, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes am excited but the time frame of doing next payment might not be flexible for me. My question is all the payments are suppose to be done on this short period of time.Or there's an opportunity to cover stage by stage until you are done upto June
19/10/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @263778355243, Although Could you please let me know which payment have you mentioned here.

16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243 All your doubt swill be cleared as we move on with the session, If you still have doubts we will surely assist you at the end.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 835 5243: 1) $1305
2) 2024-2025
3)
4)$750
16/11/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, Let me correct on the second point about the duration of your course as it's 3years. Also, Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1305, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2555. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Okay l see
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you plans to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2305 ($1305 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Following
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2305, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted then my question is l can't afford to pay the amount required now by the university which already responded me whats next the time frame is not flexible for me right now
16/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243, I can understand your point, however as we proceed with the session, we will assist on this for sure.
16/11/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2305. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1305, which will need to be paid by your parents.
16/11/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes I see but the EWYL needs much focus and time to concentrate on it. On my side as for now l was tied up and am sure credits adjustments are very poor. And the time am ready to do it if from December. But I get your point
16/11/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243, I can understand that you are occupied with the things, however I would like to inform you that the EWYL Credits are totally adjustable to your tuition fees without any inconvenience and I have complete confidence in your dedication to the EWYL Program. I believe you will work diligently to reduce the cost of your education, and your mentors will offer valuable guidance to help you achieve your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted @919650537098
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once you arrives in India will be as follows:

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1305 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1305 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2555. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2555 - $750 = $1805. This amount can be paid in two installments of $903 and $902, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.
16/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
16/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Yes am following
16/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263778355243. At the same time, as you can see in your offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as *November 28th, 2023.*

However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Explain
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023.*(which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 28th, 2023.*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 835 5243: It's all clear Ashie. What if I failed to meet the target is there any chance of getting another offer letter from other universities
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243 May I kindly know why are considering that you won't be able to make it?
16/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Maybe l fail to get the finances as soon as possible to meet the deadline
16/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778355243 We will talk about this for sure later in the discussion. However, before that now that we are clear with the payment plan, we can also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Domboshava
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 835 5243: My assumption was maybe we are going to do other payments next year all payment within a short period of time l doubt if I can make it. That's why am asking if this one is the last offer. Do l have another opportunity of enrolling on another intake besides this one. After paying up the last enrollment payment and do another payment by 28th and 28th December l don't think I will make it
16/11/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We truly understand your situation @263778355243, Let me share that this is the first offer letter we have shared with you, other university is also processing your application. However, I would like to inform you that the PDM University is shared the due dates with us which we have shared with you, considering that you are having challenges we will surely discuss more that them. I hope you understand.
16/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted Thank you Ashie
16/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -
