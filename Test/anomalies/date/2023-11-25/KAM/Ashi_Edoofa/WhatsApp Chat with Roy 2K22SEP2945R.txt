Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
14/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I am ready sir
14/09/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.

14/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I had forgotten some of the stages on the admission cycle but i just recalled when i saw that picture.
14/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
15/09/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good morning sir

15/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir.
May we have our session tomorrow if that is okay with you. I was caught up with school work today
06/10/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afteroon, Parents and my dear student.

I extend my gratitude for your understanding and patience. I trust you are in good health and high spirits. Please accept my apologies for the delay in communication over the past few days. As we approached the end of the intake year in 2023, my focus was on facilitating the smooth arrival and integration of new students.

With that in mind, I am eager to reconnect and prioritize our upcoming session scheduled for this Monday at 3:00 PM. I anticipate a productive and engaging discussion. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your cherished family.
06/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Thank you for the warm message Mr Shivjeet and we understand the delay in communication. I am looking forward to the upcoming session on Monday. I wish you a wonderful weekend too and I will convey my warm regards to my family.
09/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good morning sir @918384048513
09/10/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Good afternoon sir.
We are available for the session
09/10/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Could you please let me know if you could please share me your understanding about the same ?
09/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I'm supposed to share my understanding about the first 3 stages?
09/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, dear.
09/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay sir.
From what I understood, the first stage of the university admission cycle was a message fro the founders of Edoofa, Mr Vivek and Mr Anghad where they were welcoming me aboard and telling me about all the stages of the Edoofa cycle and explaining them.
The second stage of the university admission cycle was the statement of purpose. This is a subjected document that gives me the opportunity to convince the admissions officers of Universities which work with Edoofa why I'm worth their scholarship. It also includes my vision, my academic progress and why I have decided to choose the particular course I am willing to partake.
Stage 3 is the counselling session on university admission where my admissions officer asked for my my documents which are required for my university application preparation.
09/10/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 492 3669: That's great news sir and indeed we are happy to receive the offer letter
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Well read sir.
We are on the same page
09/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I'm very ready sir
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I'm done reviewing. Let's discuss them in detail sir.
09/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I've considered the messages and understood. Let's carry on
09/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay sir
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Yes
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Yes.
09/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Understood
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I am following sir.
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I am not really aware.
May you provide me some information on that
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I am clear with the information now sir.
09/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Yes I agree
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 492 3669: We also have June Exams. So in that case if I decide to go with option1, can I write the June exams so that I will still be able to start my first year I 2024?
09/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I'm clear about that solution sir
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes you can,
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay sir
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I am clear about that sir
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay
09/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay I get that sir. May I have more information on these job-oriented projects
09/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, kindly connect with your mentor so that she can guide you through the same.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay I will get in touch with her on our next session which is tomorrow.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Let's move on
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I do not have any queries sir.
09/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 492 3669: My parents will also go through our conversation and if they have any queries they will definitely ask
09/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 8644 123 480: Good morning. Thank you very much for sending us these good news,and the news have just added to our high spirits.
14/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir.
Thank you very much for the good news
14/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 492 3669: @919540716843 are you available for the session sir
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
14/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 8644 123 480: Yes, I went through the offer letter
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/10/23, 6:41 am - +263 8644 123 480: Good morning Sir.    1.The per annum tuition fee after the scholarship is $1225.   2. Accommodation/hostel fee per year is included in the $1225 per annum.  3. The registration fee is $750, but we are supposed to pay $600 because the other $150 is paid by Edoofa.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225+ $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
16/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 8644 123 480: Thank you for the detailed explanation. Is there any chance that the scholarship that Roy was awarded of 65% can be increased? If so, what are the considerations?
16/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, since Roy is yet to get the A-Level Results, therefore, once the results will arrive, the scholarship would be reevaluated and might as well increased based on the results please. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 8644 123 480: Sure,thank you
16/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 8644 123 480: We would opt for Four Seater with mess due to financial constraints.
16/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 8644 123 480: On this conditional offer letter, what is ERP Fee? I would also want to know what AIU stands for. What is the AIU University equivalency and how much is it?
16/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with that. ERP is a one-time fee you are required to pay to cover the administrative costs associated with enrolling and registering at the university.

AIU stands for "Association of Indian Universities." The AIU University equivalency is a process where foreign qualifications are evaluated and equated to the corresponding qualifications in India. This is important to ensure that your qualifications are recognized in the Indian education system. The cost of the AIU University equivalency should also be specified in your offer letter. I hope this is clear, right?
16/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 8644 123 480: How much is ERP and AIU respectively?
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the ERP Fee, it would be $7 as mentioned in the offer letter please, and when it comes to the AIU Fee, it would be around $200 for the whole course duration. I hope this is clear, right?
18/10/23, 12:57 am - +263 8644 123 480: Good Day
18/10/23, 12:57 am - +263 8644 123 480: It is clear now
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Roy!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 8644 123 480: Good morning Sir. I would like to inform you that my financial arrangements are not immediately arranged,and I kindly request to make the following proposal for the payment of the $600 registration: I wish to pay all the $600 on or before 17 November 2023, it is my humble request sir because at the moment I am financially crippled.
19/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 8644 123 480: We are clear Sir,thank you
19/10/23, 12:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, let us first complete the discussion about the offer letter so that you can have clarity on that and then we will move ahead to discuss these concerns, will that be okay with you?
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Good day @919540716843
19/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 8644 123 480: Owky Sir
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, if I may ask are you clear till here please?
19/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 492 3669: We are clear sir.
19/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 8644 123 480: Yes it's clear
19/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 5:51 am - +263 8644 123 480: Quite clear Sir
20/10/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
20/10/23, 11:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, if I may ask are you clear till here so that we can proceed with the next steps in your admission journey?
20/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir
20/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 492 3669: We are clear there. Let's move on with our admission journey
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2225 and so the balance fee becomes $2225 - $1000 = $1225 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
20/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I get that sir
20/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 492 3669: But my per annum fees after the scholarship is $1225so meaning if I'm to earn 1000 in a year then I'll pay a small amount of money for my tuition
20/10/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is absolutely right! Isn't that exciting?
20/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 492 3669: It's exciting indeed.
20/10/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2225, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2225 - $750= $1475, and that can be paid in two parts of $737 & $738 at a gap of 6 months. 

Are we on the same page here as well?
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Yes sir I know my EWYL mentor, Ms Sharda will be very helpful
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Sir just to confirm, This $2225 would be including both the hostel fee and the tuition right?
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, indeed, she is a wonderful mentor and she will make sure to guide you well in your journey!
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, this is absolutely right!
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okky sir,thats great news
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Indeed.
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 492 3669: We are now on the same page sir. Let's move on
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 492 3669: We are clear sir.
I will have to wait for my parents to also see these messages regarding the registration fee and confirm.
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 492 3669: No.
We are staying in Bulawayo sir
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay sir.
I guess I will hear the rest from my father which payment method her prefers but I think since we are staying far from Harare, he might choose to do a bank transfer with banks like Stanbic bank or FBC bank.
20/10/23, 9:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Yes sir.
Please send them.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 492 3669: Okay thank you sir. Much appreciated.
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 492 3669: I don't have any queries as of yet sir.
If I have anything to ask you I will do so.
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
