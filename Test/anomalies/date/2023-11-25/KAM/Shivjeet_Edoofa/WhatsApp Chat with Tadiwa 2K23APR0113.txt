09/09/23, 9:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tadiwa,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

07/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I propose that we reschedule and connect with each other at 3:00 PM on Monday. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter are highly appreciated.

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok thank you
09/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 571 4451: We are fine.my son may be busy polishing up syllabus for their upper six exams .
10/10/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tadiwa. 

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I was not able to connect with you the previous day as my available hour had ended. Please let me know if you are available so that we can further proceed with the session.
21/10/23, 8:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tadiwa!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Good evening to you... We can start tomorrow
23/10/23, 6:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tadiwa!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time.
23/10/23, 6:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tadiwa!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
26/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Good evening to you
26/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 228 1130: I think we better have it at 7:30pm
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that works as well.
26/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
26/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes yes am ready
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok this is good, l get it... Am proud to be a proud Edoofian
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 228 1130: I get it well
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yeah you can provide me with more information on it... So i can have brighter view
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok now l get it clear, we can proceed
26/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok these are when a student fail to achieve 2 A level passes
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok noted
26/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes yes it's clear... I hope we can continue tomorrow
26/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon.

I will be concluding our session for the day and look forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow, starting from 12:00 PM. Additionally, I will also be available in the evening from 7:30 PM onward. In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful evening, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/10/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 571 4451: Greetings, I'm Tadiwas' father. Time frame of paying first $300 is very short. It may be a surprise if I tell you that most of time our pockets will paneless in addition nothing in bank accounts due to our economic hardship.it's not easy to raise that amount within such period. If not mistaken it's less than 2weeks...bt I'm willing for my son to hv a step ahead.
27/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Name!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as we are approaching the weekend, we are limited by our time. I appreciate your understanding of the situation, and I understand that the financial aspect can be challenging for many families and I am more than happy to hear that in our upcoming session.

For further continuation with sufficient time and productivity, I will be available from 3:00 PM on the coming Monday, which is the 30th of November, to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, as we can do that too. Thank you for your understanding, and please do enjoy your weekend.
28/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 228 1130: Good morning
28/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 228 1130: I didn't receive any letter upto now
30/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Good evening, how are you...
30/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. How are you and your family doing today?
30/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 228 1130: We are all fine... Just waiting for the session around 7:30pm
30/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you are comfortable and available now, we can indeed proceed with the session now as well.
30/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes am available, we can
30/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
30/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes yes... I get it clear... It's so clear
30/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok... Edoofa is fair right...
30/10/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 228 1130: I get all clear... If any question arise l will ask you
30/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
30/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes yes l can't wait for the next steps and receiving my offer letter to be one of those who have commenced their admission procedures
30/10/23, 6:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
30/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok thank you for the process to be taken
30/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
30/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok thank you for the session
01/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Good evening

16/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Tadiwa!
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Am sure, l can connect with you around 2:00pm because am going to have a 3 hour exam from 9am
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yes yes it's clear and it will be much helpful in terms of finances...
17/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
17/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok let's move on
17/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrive in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837 and $838, with a six-month gap between them. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before [name] arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yeah yeah... We are in the same path
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok... You can... What about paying this in two batches
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Yeah now l get it clear
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Am in Masvingo province
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Thank you for the contact
17/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 228 1130: I can manage that one in Harare it's cheaper
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, if incase making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
