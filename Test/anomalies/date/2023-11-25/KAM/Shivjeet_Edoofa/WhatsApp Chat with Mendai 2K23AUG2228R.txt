Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/09/23, 9:24 pm - +260 97 8532307: Yes please
01/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 9:37 pm - +260 97 8532307: You can go ahead
01/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/09/23, 9:47 pm - +260 97 8532307: They are clear
01/09/23, 9:47 pm - +260 97 8532307: You may carry on
01/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/09/23, 9:57 pm - +260 97 8532307: Yes I am
Carry on
01/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/09/23, 10:09 pm - +260 97 8532307: I am clear
01/09/23, 10:21 pm - +260 97 8532307: You may proceed
01/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
01/09/23, 10:36 pm - +260 97 8532307: So when does the visa approval occur
Because I might have to go India earlier in order to seat for the NEET examinations
02/09/23, 10:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Mendai. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

Regarding your concern, I would like you to know that the VISA process will be carried out once the student completes the registration process and after they have received the acceptance letter from the university. <This message was edited>

Basically emphasizing the need for quick feedback, the documents required, recommendations as well as statement of purpose....students giving grounds on why they should be considered for admission, students achievements in the past and experience so far
- There is also mention of linkages to learning institutions for interactive sessions.
05/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
05/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
05/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
05/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
05/09/23, 5:43 pm - +260 97 8108842: Yes we are on the same page.
05/09/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
05/09/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 PM.
05/09/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

12/09/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted, thanks. Kindly note that I may not be able to join the sessions before Friday. I have a funeral and burial is likely to be Friday. However, I will send the recommendation letter as soon as I receive from school. They promised to work on it today.

12/09/23, 10:22 pm - +260 97 8108842: Find attached the recommendation for Mendai. I have since requested also for confirmation of the subjects he will sit for. They have omitted that in the letter.
13/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mendai. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - +260 95 3025773: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 9:00 pm - +260 95 3025773: Good evening. We are doing fine. Hope you are alright too.
13/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, than you for asking and thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/09/23, 9:14 pm - +260 95 3025773: Thank you very much. We confirm that the course is B.Sc (Cardiovascula Technology) and the arrival in India is scheduled for August 2024. We confirm the information is accurate.
13/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
13/09/23, 9:31 pm - +260 95 3025773: We can start only Friday because of the funeral i referred to earlier on.
13/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, kindly excuse me for that. Indeed we shall further proceed with our session from friday.
13/09/23, 10:06 pm - +260 95 3025773: Sure. Thanks a lot.
15/09/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mendai. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you were able to join the EWYLL group that was shared with you?
15/09/23, 2:40 pm - +260 95 3025773: Yes we are ready to start.
15/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Mendai. I hope you are well and blessed. Thank you for letting me know. Please relate the same information to your EWYL mentor as well.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - +260 95 3025773: Sure. Noted
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Mendai,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:09 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good evening. Our weekend was restful.
18/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 9:07 pm - +260 97 8108842: I must have missed out on the correspondence around our session tonight. I was only aware of the one to run from 08.30 AM to 09.30 AM.
18/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Unfortunately, our available hours are spanning from *12:00 pm to 04:00 pm CAT* and *07:30 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted. I was under the impression that we are now dealing with EYWL. I propose We have the session between 12 PM and 04 PM tomorrow.
18/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well we shall connect tomorrow afternoon for the further process of our session.
18/09/23, 9:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: Sure. Thanks. Will be available.
19/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Mendai,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
19/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good evening. Understood. That is great.
19/09/23, 8:30 pm - +260 97 8108842: I can see the smiles on the faces of the students.
19/09/23, 8:34 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am impressed to see happy faces.
19/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With the continuation fo our session. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/09/23, 9:01 pm - +260 97 8108842: Understood but at what stage does the reservation fee get paid. Before or after the Grade 12 results are out? In other words what criteria is being used to make the offer letter?
19/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. We wll come to that as well.
19/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 5:55 am - +260 97 8108842: Yes it was discussed. It was clear in terms of how it is accounted for towards the first year fees.
20/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 8108842: Evening. We are alright. Hope you are fine too.
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - +260 97 8108842: Glad you are alright. Sure I am ready.
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 8:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: Yes we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
20/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/09/23, 9:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: I have taken note of the example
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
20/09/23, 9:31 pm - +260 97 8108842: Very clear. Thanks a lot.
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 9:45 pm - +260 97 8108842: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 9:47 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is fine, except I am still not clear when the $500-$700 will be paid... as in specific dates....2023 or January 2024 after Grade 12 results.
20/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad that you asked that. It will be required to be paid after the arrival of the offer letter and the deadline will be mentioned in the offer letter. May I know if you are clear here?
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is very clear
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
20/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
20/09/23, 10:14 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are available at 15 hours tomorrow.
21/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We are alright.
21/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - +260 97 8108842: We can proceed
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are looking forward to receiving the offer letter.
21/09/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 8108842: Will the offer letter state the university or college where reservation has to be made or it will be a list of institutions to choose from?
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 8108842: I was initially of the view that the offer letter comes after the Grade 12 results are out
21/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. You will be able to receive one offer letter per university. May I know if we are on the same page here?
21/09/23, 4:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted.
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding his concern, we will come to the amazing opportunity that we have now. Shall we proceed?
21/09/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 8108842: Let us proceed
21/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/09/23, 4:40 pm - +260 97 8108842: We can proceed
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 4:48 pm - +260 97 8108842: Clear.
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 5:08 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear.
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 5:17 pm - +260 97 8108842: It does though I need some clarity around endowment. Is it like insurance?
21/09/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern it is basically a series of benefits for your admission process. Where the benefits are mentioned above and we are now undergoing its details. May I know if we are clear here?
21/09/23, 5:34 pm - +260 97 8108842: We can proceed
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 8108842: Great. Point well elaborated
21/09/23, 5:37 pm - +260 97 8108842: It does. It is clear.
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 6:24 pm - +260 97 8108842: Your explanation is clear.
21/09/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 8:11 pm - +260 97 8108842: I would appreciate more information to be provided on it.
22/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are doing fine. However, we have reached a snag in that the EWYL sessions going forward require Mendai's full participation. This can only be possible when he returns home late November/early December 2023 when he completes school. We have been guided that he does an email in the following guide "If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com"
25/09/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am yet to engage the school to find a way of communicating to him so that he drafts the email as guided.
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - +260 95 3025773: He has been engaged and will do likewise.
04/10/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 3:09 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the update. 

We had written mail as per academic board terms that Mendai will only be available after the 26th November, 2023 and that he (Mendai) would inform his counsellor Ms. Sanjana the moment he is done with exams.
04/10/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that attending school might pose challenges for your participation. As the university admission process has commenced early. I would like both you and your parents to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.
04/10/23, 3:24 pm - +260 97 8108842: We can proceed in that case but Mendai is not allowed to have access to phones at his school, hence postponing sessions for the other group till he is available November monthend.

If the sessions do not need Mendai's active and full participation like we had reached in the other group, then we are good to continue with me, the father to Mendai.
04/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update, and I appreciate your understanding of Mendai's situation regarding phone access at school.  and yes from now on we can can proceed without the involvement of Mendai.
04/10/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted, thanks.
04/10/23, 3:55 pm - +260 97 8108842: Kindly advise the days and times.
04/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed now? 

We will be connecting each day until we complete our session at 3:00 PM daily.
04/10/23, 4:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am not ready today. We can continue tomorrow.
04/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall indeed connect tomorrow for further process of our session.
04/10/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 8108842: Sure. Thanks.
07/10/23, 11:40 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I propose that we reschedule and connect with each other at 3:00 PM on Monday. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter are highly appreciated.

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted. I am alright. Monday is fine.
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good afternoon. We can get started.
09/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With regards to our previous conversation, may I know if you are clear and currently on the same page to further proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear. And we can proceed.
09/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 4:20 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am familiar. I would not mind you providing more information for us to be on the same page.
09/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is quite clear. The explanation is elaborate.
09/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear on the first and second options. I am, however,  not clear on option 3, (Benefit Number 7). How does this become a benefit?
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright I will help you get clear. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 4:43 pm - +260 97 8108842: This is clear.
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear on this part too.
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 8108842: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - +260 97 8108842: Also clear.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 5:05 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is clear.
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Mendai's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Mendai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am looking forward to that as long as the process does not require his involvement and participation before 26th  November as earlier communicated as he has no access to phone currently at school
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is well noted.
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Mendai's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - +260 97 8108842: Thank you very much. Looking forward to receiving feedback from you the soonest.
14/10/23, 9:21 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 9:21 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 9:22 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 8108842: Good morning. Thanks a lot for the update. Looking forward to further discussions around the scholarship.
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mendai!

I wanted to ensure that you have a better understanding of the offer letter, and to allow for a more detailed discussion of your concerns, I'd like to reschedule our conversation for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT. Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good afternoon. Noted, thanks. However, my Sunday is committed with church programs unless we make it about 8 in the evening, or better still Monday anytime of your convenience.
15/10/23, 9:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail? <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 12:06 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We are doing fine, hope you are fine too. Sorry I am unable to continue as requested yesterday that we either do it at 8 PM tonight or tomorrow morning. I am committed with church activity.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. On that note, can you please let me know if you are comfortable in moving ahead with the same now, or should we do that tomorrow itself?
16/10/23, 6:23 am - +260 97 8108842: Good morning. We can continue today. Kindly advise the appropriate time so that I lock it on my calendar.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
16/10/23, 11:42 am - +260 97 8108842: Good morning. We are doing fine.
16/10/23, 11:42 am - +260 97 8108842: We are ready to go through the letter. We may proceed.
16/10/23, 11:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 12:16 pm - +260 97 8108842: 1. The Per Semester tuition fee after the scholarship will be $900.00
2. Standard Duration of the course is 4 years.
3. Admission and Processing fee is $300.00
4. Registration fee is $750.00
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: What is 3 seater and 2 seater respectively? Is it number of students per room?
16/10/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 8108842: Clear.
16/10/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, in the context of on-campus accommodation, a "3 seater" means a room that accommodates three students, and a "2 seater" means a room for two students. It refers to the number of students sharing a room. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - +260 97 8108842: Exactly my thought. It is clear then.
16/10/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are together but I am enquiring on the safely of students outside campus and the ease with which to find reasonable/cheap accomodation given that they are foreign students
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mendai!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
17/10/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 8108842: Yes it does.
17/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
17/10/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - +260 97 8108842: I understand that the Admission and procedure fee has been waived....however, Registration fee still stands.
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 4:43 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear with this but seeking some clarity. In our earlier conversations 
1. There was  indication that more than 1 offer letter may be received and we would then have to make a choice depending on the level of scholarship and also how the tertiary institution ranks in India. Does it mean this will be the only offer? If there might be other offers which may turn out to be cheaper than the current what happens to the $750 which is being asked for in 15 days?
2. Does it mean all tertiary institutions in India only give scholarship on Tuition only while the student has to foot the entire bill for food and accomodation?
17/10/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 8108842: My thoughts are that we look at all the offers available, compare then make reservation at a tertiary institution of our choice and affordability.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mendia!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here please. Moving ahead, I am more than willing to help you in understanding the same, hence, may I know if we can move ahead to discuss about the same?
18/10/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: Let us proceed.
18/10/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. On that note, shall we move ahead to complete our dicussion regarding the offer letter first? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: Sure
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 8108842: I do not stay in Zimbabwe but Zambia, Lusaka in particular.
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the same please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: I cannot pay for now because you have to clarify my concerns before any further commitments.
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: I asked because I needed clarity before any further payments.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear. Now, regarding your first query, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
18/10/23, 11:24 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear. At this point. The clarity I need is when  fee to reserve a place at a university is paid, like I'm the current case, what does it mean if another offer is given?.Does one pay another reservation fee?
19/10/23, 7:21 am - +260 97 8108842: Meant "like is the current case"
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mendai!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: Good afternoon. I will be available.
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Mendai!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:39 pm - +260 97 8108842: We can proceed
19/10/23, 7:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am not clear. I asked whether this is the only offer or there are others coming.
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - +260 97 8108842: I also asked what paying $750 in terms of reservation means. If I paid this amount and another offer comes....do I again have to pay reservation fee if I get to choose the second offer instead of the first one?
19/10/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
19/10/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 7:52 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear. Then we can wait for other offers so we compare affordability and education rankings. I was thinking $750 is for reserving a seat at the University which has made the offer, hence my concern to say is it the only offer?
19/10/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I am giving you clarity on that. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 7:55 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear.
19/10/23, 7:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/10/23, 8:01 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am quite clear.
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 8:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am not aware of the transfer option. Kindly shed more light.
19/10/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/10/23, 8:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: Undetstood
19/10/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is now clear. This is the explanation I needed because then my concern was paying again in case a better offer arose. Thanks for the clarity.
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I believe you are clear about the same, right?
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am now clear
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, shall we proceed from here and should I share Penmal Connect's details with you here?
19/10/23, 8:22 pm - +260 97 8108842: Yes you may proceed to share
19/10/23, 8:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, here are the account details please:

Account Name - Penmal Connect Limited
Account Number - 0222030000591
Name of Bank - Indo Zambia Bank
Branch Name - Jacaranda
Sort Code - 090122
Swift Code - INZAZMLX
19/10/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 8108842: Is there a possibility of using First National Bank, which I have an account with? As was the case in the initial transaction?
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - +260 97 8108842: I can still engage and get more details from Penmal Connect
19/10/23, 8:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dar, you can do that as well. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
19/10/23, 8:33 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted. Thanks for the guidance.
19/10/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 8:37 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear and appreciate the effort Edoofa is making in lightening the cost of education in India
19/10/23, 8:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: One more point of clarification....does the $800.00 accomodation fee also include food or students fend for themselves?
19/10/23, 10:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm pleased to hear that you appreciate the efforts we're making to make education more accessible. We're here to support you every step of the way. Regarding your question about accommodation, I'd like to clarify that the $800.00 accommodation fee includes not just the housing but also covers food costs. This fee encompasses the overall living expenses, so students won't need to worry about separate food expenses.

This approach is aimed at ensuring that students have a convenient and inclusive living arrangement during their studies, making it more cost-effective and convenient for students pursuing education in India. I hope you are clear till here, right? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - +260 97 8108842: I am clear and please about the initiative.
20/10/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, it was quite late and I had already wrapped up for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
20/10/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 8108842: Yes it is clear and quite helpful.
20/10/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 8108842: Let us proceed with the insights about the university.
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/10/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
21/10/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 8108842: Good morning. We are all doing fine and are excited about the opportunity. We have discussed the letter as a family and had the opportunity of doing the same with Mendai when we travelled to his school yesterday (Open Day) to get feedback from his teachers on his performance and update him on the offer letter. He was equally excited about the offer. We found him in good spirit.
21/10/23, 9:29 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/10/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 8108842: All went well. We are quite elated by the fact that our child will have an opportunity to pursue his career in one of the highly rated Universities in India. We are equally excited about the fact that he will have the opportunity to contribute towards lowering the cost of his tuition fee while studying.
21/10/23, 9:42 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/10/23, 9:53 am - +260 97 8108842: So far so good. The major concern we had was that of out of campus accomodation. The issue was around proximity to the University and Security. However, we got settled after the assurance given.
21/10/23, 9:54 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/10/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 8108842: We are still doing further research about the University. In terms of location is Delhi NCR the same as New Delhi?
21/10/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 8108842: Regarding payment, we need further guidance in terms of beneficiary details....or narration to appear on the Penmal Connect Bank statement.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - +260 97 8108842: Is the Penmal Connect Account held at Indo Zambia Bank a Kwacha or Dollar Account? In other words we would like to know whether we will need to purchase dollar and deposit or we will use Kwacha equivalent of $750 and just deposit Zambian Kwacha.
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for raising these important questions. Let me answer them here.

Regarding your question about Delhi NCR, it stands for the National Capital Region of Delhi. It includes New Delhi, along with several surrounding cities and districts. So, when you hear "Delhi NCR," it typically refers to the broader area around New Delhi.
21/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the Indo-Zambian Bank Account, it is a Kwacha Account please, therefore, you do not need to buy USD to make the payment please. I hope this is clear?
21/10/23, 10:17 am - +260 97 8108842: Noted. Thanks for the clarification.
21/10/23, 10:18 am - +260 97 8108842: It is clear. What narration is supposed to be put in relation to the deposit?
21/10/23, 10:21 am - Milan Edoofa: As for the narration to be put in relation to the deposit, you should include your full name and the purpose of the payment i.e. university registration fee.
21/10/23, 10:21 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, I would also like to mention that once you are ready to make the payment please connect with me once before that so that I can help you with the exact amount in Kwachas as per the exchange rate on that day to be paid. I hope this is clear?
21/10/23, 10:22 am - +260 97 8108842: Do I put mine or the Student's.....Mendai Mebelo?
21/10/23, 10:22 am - +260 97 8108842: We will engage you accordingly.
21/10/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: The student name please.
21/10/23, 10:23 am - +260 97 8108842: Great!
21/10/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you have any other querie please?
21/10/23, 10:25 am - +260 97 8108842: No further queries...the one I had (narration) has been addressed.....Mendai Mebelo: University Registration Fee
21/10/23, 10:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
21/10/23, 10:30 am - +260 97 8108842: Oh wow! Thanks for the reminder. It skipped my mind that $150 has been waived due to Early Registration....bring down the figure from $750.00 to $600.00.

The ideal option for us would be to clear the $600.00 at once to avoid Foreign Exchange Currency flactuations.
21/10/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
21/10/23, 10:37 am - +260 97 8108842: I would have loved to pay the full $600 by 31.10.2023 if you are able to build in that  flexibility as opposed to 28th October. Your thoughts.
21/10/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 8108842: However, I am working towards the same 28.10.2023 though that might be the installment route
21/10/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. However, on that note since the deadline is of 28th October, you can move ahead to make the payments according to the same as well. I hope this is clear?
21/10/23, 10:42 am - +260 97 8108842: I am not clear. Is this response in line with my proposal of 31st October in full or in line with the deadline of 28th instalment should the amount available be less than 600$?
21/10/23, 10:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. You can move ahead to make the payment as per the deadline date according to the amount that you would be able to raise till then. I hope this is clear?
21/10/23, 10:47 am - +260 97 8108842: It is noted.
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
21/10/23, 11:46 am - +260 97 8108842: We will engage you should challenges regarding the scholarship arise.
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you've made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I’m here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
21/10/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 8108842: We shall keep you updated. Thanks.
25/10/23, 7:30 am - +260 97 8108842: Good morning Mr. Singh. We hope you are doing fine. I would like to inform you that I would like to make a payment of $300.00 tomorrow. You can therefore, as agreed, advise on the aspect of the Kwacha/ Dollar Exchange rate the earliest tomorrow morning.
25/10/23, 7:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mendai!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/10/23, 7:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I would like to inform you that the amount to be paid in Zambian Kwachas is equals to ZMW 7167, therefore, you can move ahead to make the payment accordingly.
25/10/23, 7:47 am - +260 97 8108842: We are doing fine.
25/10/23, 7:48 am - +260 97 8108842: Noted, thank you.

02/11/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mendai!

02/11/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, the payment of the registration fee that you made was confirmed from the side of the accounts team please.
