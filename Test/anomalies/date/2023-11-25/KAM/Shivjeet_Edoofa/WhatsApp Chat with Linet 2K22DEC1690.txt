15/09/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
15/09/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 3:14 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes l remember
15/09/23, 3:15 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted
15/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
15/09/23, 3:25 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
15/09/23, 3:25 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Is it correct
15/09/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
15/09/23, 3:27 pm - +27 60 500 3117: No not yet
15/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
15/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/10/23, 12:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afteroon, Parents and my dear student.

I extend my gratitude for your understanding and patience. I trust you are in good health and high spirits. Please accept my apologies for the delay in communication over the past few days. As we approached the end of the intake year in 2023, my focus was on facilitating the smooth arrival and integration of new students.

With that in mind, I am eager to reconnect and prioritize our upcoming session scheduled for this Monday at 3:00 PM. I anticipate a productive and engaging discussion. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your cherished family.
09/10/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 5:01 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Afternoon how are you

I am sorry l was in an exam
18/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the opportunities that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Yes l agree
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Yes it's clear
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 3:55 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Yes it's clear
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Yes l am clear
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - +27 62 650 1255: No queries
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Linet's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Linet is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Yes am looking forward to receiving the letter
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your  application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - +27 62 650 1255: Thank you
07/11/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Linet.
07/11/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
07/11/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 07:00 PM.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 07:00 PM to 9:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
08/11/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 1:04 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes we are very  happy as a family 

All thanks to you
08/11/23, 1:05 pm - +27 60 500 3117: I had gone through it
08/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are feeling happy and thankful for this opportunity. It's a fantastic achievement, and I'm truly pleased to have been part of this journey with you. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 1:26 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes we can proceed
08/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - +27 60 500 3117: 1. 1800 USD 
2. 5 years , 10 semesters 
3. 300 USD 
4. 750 USD
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the answer. May I know if you are correct that the tuition fees for the semesters, after the scholarship, is $1800?
08/11/23, 1:47 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk l did not understand the question before ....it's 900 USD after scholarship
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright now. Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes it's clear
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 1:53 pm - +27 60 500 3117: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Off - campus Accommodation is cheaper than On -Campus 

What about the transport  costs if you seek for accommodation independently ......
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well.
08/11/23, 2:06 pm - +27 60 500 3117: It's now clear
08/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 2:08 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes  very clear
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Clear
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Why 16November it is said within 15 days 
....by 16 November that will be 8 days
08/11/23, 2:15 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Meaning 300$ is part of registration fee 750 making it 1050$
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. Please excuse me for the errors in the previous messages. I forwarded them on behalf of one of my students, and indeed for you it is after 15 days which is the 22nd of November. May I know if you are clear here? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, the $300 will not be a part of any fees, as it has been removed under the endowment plan. This means it will not be added to any of your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 2:29 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes clear now
08/11/23, 2:29 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 2:33 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes explain
08/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhhk noted
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - +27 60 500 3117: What happens if l fail to pay within the given dates
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Would you mind sharing if you are currently encountering any challenges that have prompted your inquiry?
08/11/23, 2:52 pm - +27 60 500 3117: I am just stating a fact,  no problem as of now
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright; there is no need to worry about that. Even if there are certain cases that lead the university to revoke the offer letter, we do not want to make that happen, and we will make sure that you are well-informed and notified about the deadlines of your letter. May I know if you are clear on this?
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes this is clear ......but my questions  is what happens if l fail to pay on the given dates
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.

Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the deadlines so that they start preparing early. May I know if you are clear on this?
08/11/23, 3:09 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted clear
08/11/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 4:45 pm - +27 60 500 3117: I stay in Bulawayo
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - +27 60 500 3117: What about Bulawayo , because l don't know or have  any relative in Harare
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case you can still use the original mode of payment that use you used to pay the enrollment fees and I am coming that too, very soon too.
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk
08/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you happen to make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Would you please let me know if we are still connected so that we can proceed with the session and hopefully complete our session on time to avoid delays on your offer letter? @27605003117 ?
08/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I noticed that we faced some challenges in maintaining a smooth discussion. I understand that there may have been some difficulties, and as your admission officer, I want to ensure we find the best solution.

To facilitate a more productive and efficient discussion regarding the letter, I would like to inquire about your availability for our session. This will allow us to complete our conversation in a timely and effective manner and avoid potential delay on the offer letter which may get revoked by the university.
08/11/23, 7:08 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Yes we are together
08/11/23, 7:09 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted
08/11/23, 7:10 pm - +27 60 500 3117: Am l suppose to go to Harare and make the payments or there is another way of paying without going there
08/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Od course there is. You also have the option to continue using your previous payment method through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee. Please note that international transfer charges for this option are 12.5% of the total amount. Would you like the account details again?
08/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like to continue and proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

09/11/23, 10:44 am - +27 60 500 3117: Yes l lost them
09/11/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/11/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
09/11/23, 10:50 am - +27 60 500 3117: ohhhk noted
09/11/23, 10:50 am - +27 60 500 3117: Yes l have received them
09/11/23, 10:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right Linet, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
09/11/23, 10:56 am - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted
09/11/23, 10:57 am - +27 60 500 3117: When are these  fees paid , now or later when l am at the university
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with the same here, the tuition fees and the accommodation fees are required to be paid after your arrival in India, in order to reserve your seat at the university you will be required to pay the Registration fees after 15 days of the arrival of the offer letter. A detailed discussion with the breakdown and the deadlines will be discussed on the way forward. May I know if you are clear with me here?
09/11/23, 11:06 am - +27 60 500 3117: Yes clear
09/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
09/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
09/11/23, 11:08 am - +27 60 500 3117: Ohhk noted
09/11/23, 11:09 am - +27 60 500 3117: An advantage indeed
09/11/23, 11:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
09/11/23, 11:18 am - +27 60 500 3117: Understood
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/11/23, 11:21 am - +27 60 500 3117: Yes noted .....l guess hard work on EWYL really pays a lot
09/11/23, 11:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
09/11/23, 11:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/11/23, 11:24 am - +27 60 500 3117: No questions so far , so good and l'm happy
09/11/23, 11:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
