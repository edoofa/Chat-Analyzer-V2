14/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 271 9887: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
14/10/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 271 9887: Ok
14/10/23, 9:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
14/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 271 9887: The admission process  starts with the message that l receive from the founders   ,then l write my statement of purpose that will be used to  admit me into different  universities , l hen go through the counselling sessions for my admission process and then the offer letters that l get after being admitted to university.
14/10/23, 10:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 10:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 271 9887: I have been looking forward to this day for too long and l can't contain the excitement l have right now
14/10/23, 10:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/10/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
14/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 301 6196: We are ready
16/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Good afternoon

17/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
17/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
17/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Done sir
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Wow that's great
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Yes
17/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Yes and thank you Edoofa
17/10/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Noted
17/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Provide me with more information please
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?"No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 78 301 6196: Yes thank you
18/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 78 301 6196: Good morning how are you doing today
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes we can
18/10/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 271 9887: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
18/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 271 9887: I understand
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Makanaka's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Makanaka is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
18/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Makanaka's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Thank you
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Afternoon
20/10/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Makanaka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. How may I help you today?
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 301 6196: How are you too sir
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 271 9887: How are you sir
20/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if there is any concerns that you would like to share it with me?
20/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 271 9887: What if l realise that l want to change my university is it possible
20/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is. You will be able to receive multiple offer letters, and you will be able to choose the best out of them, guided by us. May I know if you are clear here?
20/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes it is thank you

20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are specifically referring to the course of law, it is not possible to convert it into a 3-year course, dear.

23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that you have been provided with the LLB course, which is one of the most demanding courses. With this qualification, you can even work as an independent lawyer without depending on an employer, which is pretty good, especially considering the changing economic state.
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Here in Zimbabwe you may not be able to stand alone and also the issue of duration
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that, as you may already know we have also uploaded the documents with the university officials too.

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

On that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the offr letter discussion. 

Shall we begin?
08/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Good evening
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 301 6196: We are ready
08/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 271 9887: We are ready
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Yes
08/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 271 9887: 1.900
2.5years
3.15 days 
4 .750
08/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you have answered the question 3 correctly?
08/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Good evening
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 271 9887: 1. 900
2.5years
3.300
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
08/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes
08/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 414 9439: But we said earlier on that it's a bit expensive maybe to us to be frank.
08/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your concern about the cost, and it's important to make an informed decision about your education. I'll be able to guide you on how to reduce it. So, shall we continue with the session?
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Yes
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Are we not going to get from other universities?
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 414 9439: So that we compare and get the one we can afford
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 414 9439: My network is slow it's raining here
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter. Which will be discussed in detail soon.

Regarding the registration fee that you will be required to pay for the current university. Do not worry about it, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Didn't quite understand the last part on accomodation independently
08/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you please elaborate on that aspect that you don't quite understand, so that I can provide more assistance?
08/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/11/23, 6:11 am - +263 78 301 6196: Thank you
09/11/23, 6:38 am - +263 77 414 9439: That last part where you talked about reducing accomodation to $800
09/11/23, 9:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Makanaka. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you
09/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Ready
09/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 414 9439: How are you?
09/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Evening sir
09/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Evening
14/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Dear parents and Makanaka!

I hope you are well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message when you were online, as it was a long weekend here in India, followed by a national holiday—Diwali, also known as the festival of lights.

With that said, today is a special day for us here in India, known as Children’s Day. I wish you a happy Children's Day, and with that said, I am ready to take on today's session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you very much
I hope you enjoyed your holiday
14/11/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Yes, I did enjoy it. Now, if you are ready for the session, shall we proceed?
14/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected with the session so that we can proceed and complete it within our time frame to avoid any delays on the offer letter? @263774149439 ?
14/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
14/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, with further continuation with the session. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
14/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you very much
14/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
14/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
14/11/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
14/11/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
14/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Okay yes
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
14/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
14/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 7:13 am - +263 78 271 9887: Okay yes
15/11/23, 7:27 am - +263 77 414 9439: Morning
We are saying that we are to pay 
1. Tuition fees $900 per semester 
2. Registration $750 
3. Caution ERP $25 
4. University ID card $13
5. Examination fee $100 per semester 


Am I correct?
15/11/23, 7:38 am - +263 77 414 9439: I asked because presently we are relocating to another work station which requires a lot of money might take all our monthly income for the two months then so it might be difficult though it's very much cheap given that Edoofa would have helped us with $150 quite commendable benovelence
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Makanaka!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. That is correct, with the inclusion of the Edoofa grant of $150, and I will be providing you with the overall cost of education per annum as we proceed with the session. So, if you are available now, please do let me know so that we can proceed with the session and complete our discussion on time to avoid any delays on your letter.
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Good afternoon.
Available for now
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're available. Let's proceed with our discussion. 
Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Outside Harare very far away from the capital
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to receive the contact information for Mr. Rajan. @263774149439
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you very
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Very much
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes you can relay them
15/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214

15/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you very much l lost those details long back
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Iam deciding what action to take thank you
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, take your time to carefully consider your options. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Okay thanks
15/11/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Can l know how many credits l have made whenever I want to check my progress
15/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, transparency is key in the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. You will have access to regular updates on the credits you've earned.  You can inquire about your earned credits at any time by reaching out to your designated EWYL Mentor, who will provide a detailed breakdown of your credits and their corresponding value. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 414 9439: I thought $750 is part of the tuition?
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, that is a part of the tuition fees, and the above number that I have discussed here before is the fees from your second year onwards. May I know if you are clear with me?
15/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Ok it's part of the tuition .ok okay
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Meaning to say once l pay this lam done with 1st year ?
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 414 9439: So according to that letter which says Makanaka flies to India in September 2024 therefore when does 1st year end
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 414 9439: That is if it starts in September 2024
15/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 271 9887: I have a question regarding the registration fee .Are we supposed to pay the tuition fee  also  after paying the registration fee .
15/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Okay thank you let me try to look for the money
15/11/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you want me to provide you with a detailed breakdown of your first-year overall cost of education?
15/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Are there any universities that offer free accomodation
15/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 271 9887: What if we fail to meet up with the due date
15/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely let me get to that as well. But first, here is the breakdown

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 - $750 (Registration fee) = $2050

May I know if you are clear on this?
15/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Clear thank you we were afraid we thought that if we fail to meet this deadline it's end of the road
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Thank you very much it's clear
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide clarity and alleviate any concerns you had. Now coming to the previous discusion. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 414 9439: No you can go on
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

15/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes 
How are you and your family?

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Yes we had a lengthy discussion but the family like l said earlier is in a financial crisis which will end soon father the only bread winner has been moved from the station he had been working now we are relocating in Zimbabwe traveling if you don't have own transport is costly , because of this promotion he had been on the road always it's also another expenditure on its own.So we agreed to wait for the next offer we have missed this one.
18/11/23, 9:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Makanaka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I'm sorry to hear about the financial challenges your family is facing. It sounds like a significant and difficult situation, especially with the recent changes and relocation. Prioritizing financial stability is crucial, and I completely understand your decision to wait for the next opportunity. However to understand you better here may I know how are you preparing for the next offer letter to arrive and as this is merit-based offer letter you might end up losing out on your journey towards higher education. <This message was edited>

21/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Makanaka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I would like to let you know that the university's offer letter is based on merit. Hence, I do not want to lose out on this offer letter, as the next one may not be as successful. So, may I know how much you are willing to raise now for the payment of the registration fees of this current university?
21/11/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 414 9439: It's unfortunate that it has happened during a period we are hard pressed in terms of finances we would have wanted it so much but it has coincided with a lot of challenges from our side
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Makanaka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I completely understand the challenges you're facing, especially during this financially constrained period. Your dedication to finding a solution despite these hurdles is commendable. Let's explore options together. With that may I know if you can share me with the exact challenges that  you are facing as of now regarding on your finances.
22/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 414 9439: Don't worry by January 1 everything will be normal . I don't want to get into debt so l chose to calm down wait for next offer which maybe in the region l can afford
22/11/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that by that time, your offer letter will be revoked, resulting in the loss of this opportunity. Unfortunately, I won't be able to assist you further with this matter. As your admission officer, I certainly do not want that outcome for you.
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 301 6196: <Media omitted>

I thought that we would be allowed to choose the university we want as the offers come . Galgatia is a good University yes but we strongly think that there are other universities there which are good too but if you want us to just go for Galgatia straight then
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 301 6196: Maybe we are nolonger allowed to make our choices .
22/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.

23/11/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand how frustrating power and network issues can be! Is there a particular time during the day when the network is more stable for you? Perhaps we can try scheduling our discussions during those times to ensure better communication.
