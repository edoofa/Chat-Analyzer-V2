Before we move ahead with the discussion.

Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes Sir thats correct
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah i remember some though not all the things I'm sure you will be able to help me recall some of the things during the way
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
13/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes I'm ready
13/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
13/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
13/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay I remember being told this the last time i had my sessions
13/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are
13/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
13/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
13/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are Sir
13/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
13/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 813 7664: No I don't have any questions so far we can proceed
13/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
13/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 813 7664: As far as I'm concerned the amounts yu were saying were just examples and ranges right I hope I'm not lost
13/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
13/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay Sir I'm following
13/09/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me, and my available hours are coming to an end, I would like to conclude our session for now. Let us connect tomorrow to continue our session further. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
04/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

04/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians.

20/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes m ready
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 813 7664: I'm done we can get into much detail
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Sir I've a question regarding the offer letter 
It's been long since I completed all the formalities and I also wrote my Statement of purpose but I've not been told yet about my offer letter may yu perhaps happen to know what the problem might be
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: i have take a note of that and we will come to that as well. So shall we proceed?
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we can proceed
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 813 7664: It's clear Sir we can proceed to the third
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes
23/10/23, 6:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Melisa!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time
23/10/23, 6:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Melisa!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Melisa !

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to receive a reply from you regarding the admission process for Melisa , and it seems that my previous message was left unattended.
25/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, as your admission officer, I am committed to ensuring you have a better future and affordable. So please let me know if you are available so that I can share the details of these benefits with you to help alleviate your financial burden. And it is for a limited time, I don't want you to lose out on this opportunity as well.
25/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that being said, I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currenly available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Good afternoon noon Sir I was at school 
I will be available at 7:30 PM for the session
25/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, we shall connect at the said time frame.
25/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay Sir
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 813 7664: We're doing good Sir hw are yu
25/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear you're fine, I am fine too. Shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we can proceed Sir
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Im following Sir we can proceed
25/10/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yu can provide me with more information
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Sir my battery is running out so i happen to stop replying just know my phone has switched off 
We have no electricity this side 
So in that case I'll be able to connect with yu tomorrow morning once I've charged my phone
25/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes it very clear Sir
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, dear. In that case, shall we schedule our session for 3:00 tomorrow?
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
08/11/23, 6:52 am - +263 71 813 7664: Good morning Sir 
I finished my Exams so from now I'll be available to take the session anytime
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we can proceed
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah i recall Sir 
We were discussing the benefits of Endowment program
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes Sir
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
08/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are clear
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
08/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 813 7664: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
08/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay I understand
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
08/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Concerning the admission process I've understand everything but you can clarify on the costs for the admission process
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be discussed well in your offer letter and everything will be discussed there. May I know if we areon the same page here?
08/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are
08/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
08/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes Sir
08/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
08/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay Sir
08/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings again, dear. As I was going through your documents I have noticed that you have not shared me with the A level statement of entry so please do share it with me at the earliest so that I can proceed with the documents updates with the universities. <This message was edited>

We can proceed with the session
21/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah I did go through the offer letter
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
21/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah it works Sir we can proceed
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cAmazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 813 7664: 1 per semester tuition fee -1800usd
2 standard duration of the course  -4 years
3 Admission and Procedure fee -300 Usd
4 Registration fee -750 Usd
21/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay I see
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, with further continuation. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
21/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes it does
21/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 813 7664: What is meant by three-seater or two-seater AC room
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The "three-seater" or "two-seater" in terms of accommodation refers to the number of individuals sharing the room.

A "three-seater AC room" indicates that three students will share the room, while a "two-seater AC room" means that only two individuals will occupy the space.

The key difference primarily lies in the number of students sharing the room and the size of the room itself. Typically, a two-seater room might have slightly more space per person compared to a three-seater room. Please let me know if you are clear here?
21/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah it's clear now
21/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes Sir it does
21/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 813 7664: It's clear we can move forward
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Aw really that's impressive
21/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are clear
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Is the registration fee flexible that we can pay a certain amount before 01st of December and pay the remaining afterwards?
21/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes Sir
21/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly,Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay it's clear now Sir
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we are
21/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes we reside in Harare 
Budiriro 3
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay I guess this way is better
21/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Alright Sir we once visited the area so we won't face any challenges reaching there
21/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Thank you
21/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay you can share the transfer details as well in case
21/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
21/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details?
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes thank you Sir
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay
21/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes I've understood 
Mr Austin once explained this to me which makes it very easy to understand
21/11/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yes it does
21/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 813 7664: I donn have any queries
21/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
