18/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 305 5181: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
18/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 305 5181: You may go ahead please
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 305 5181: I'm following
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
18/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 305 5181: I understand the offer letter is a letter that I shall received from the University I will be going to. Particular details to the contexts of the offer letter are now a bit vague to me
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes, I'm following
It's very thrilling indeed
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 305 5181: I am ready
You may go head!
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 305 5181: We may proceed
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 305 5181: How amazing!
18/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes
18/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It's well explained
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 305 5181: There're no questions at the moment
18/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Kindly provide more information on that
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Of course, this is very interesting
But if you don't mind me asking, what is the maximum percentage scholarship I can attain?
And how best can I attain the highest level of it?
18/10/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, I understand. Depending on your academic performance, you have the potential to receive up to a 100% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:57 am - +263 77 305 5181: Thank you for that
Noted with thanks
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as it was not my available hours by the time you reached out.

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Greetings
Yes, we may proceed
19/10/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes, I do
19/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It's clear!
19/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 305 5181: Greetings I hope you're well.
For now there aren't any questions, but, suppose I will have some later on, I'll definitely highlight and ask
20/10/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your messages by the time you have shared, as it was past my available hours. I am happy to let you know that I will be available till 1:00 PM as I have a meeting with the admission team. So, may I kindly ask if you might be available and ready for now to proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes
I am ready now
20/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in response, dear. I was occupied with the meeting. I would like to let you know that I will be occupied as well for the next 3 hours. So, shall we schedule our session for this evening at 7:30 PM?
20/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Of course that's alright with me.
20/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Michelle.

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?
20/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Good evening Admission Officer and everyone.
I'm doing pretty well this evening. I hope your day went well.
We may proceed

14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Greetings to you I hope you're well!
I can't express how happy I am to hear from you and the university again concerning the letter.
I think 7:00PM would do just fine so that we can further discuss this.
Again, thank you for the efforts you've put.
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Alright, thank you so much
I shall proceed with the questions I have.
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 305 5181: In this offer letter, there's the tuition fee after the scholarship has been provided, and the hostel charges.
I would like to know please if the hostel charges are also included in the schoolship fees?
Because the total amount to be paid would be 2565 USD?
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 305 5181: I would also clarification on what you meant by "The registration fee is non refundable if there's deficiency of original and valid documents"
15/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up this question, Michelle. Let me clarify the breakdown of the fees mentioned in the offer letter.

The tuition fee after the scholarship has been applied is a separate component from the hostel charges. In other words, the $1,315 mentioned in the offer letter is the tuition fee after the scholarship has been provided.

The hostel charges are additional and are not included in the scholarship. The hostel charges are mentioned separately, and you would need to consider them in addition to the tuition fee. II will be able to give you in-depth knowledge as we proceed with the session. So, are you ready now?
15/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 592 0318: Greetings I hope you're well.As parents, I acknowledge receipt of the offer letter with great pleasure. I however have some few questions regarding the offer letter contents.
15/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Of course you may proceed.
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 305 5181: But still on that, is it possible that a student may reside anywhere else outside the school campus due to the possibility of the hostel charges being a bit financial straining? 
Does the University allow?
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have taken note of your question, and it will soon be clear as most of them will be discussed as we proceed with the session.  Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 305 5181: 1. 657.50 per semester, amounting to 1315 per year

2. 3 years

3. 750 USD
15/11/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I will be closing our session for now due to unexpected work that just came up.

So please do excuse me for that and, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 4:50 am - +263 77 305 5181: Sure, thank you
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Michelle!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Good afternoon to you too.
I'm now ready
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Good evening
My apologies I wasn't able to connect with you further. Thank you for understanding and we will connect tomorrow.
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Good afternoon, I'm ready
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Thank you for this, it's really clear
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It's all clear
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2565, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It is clear thank you. I however have a question.
Do the students have the EWYL University banks to monitor their progress as individuals?
Is there a way a student can know the amount of EWYL credits accounted for?
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I'm glad to assist you in understanding that. Yes, a student has the capability to monitor the work they perform, and this can be achieved through engagement with mentors. My best suggestion would be to reach out to the mentors to track progress and other related aspects. Does this clarify things for you?
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Of course, thank you
17/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Michelle with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2565. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2565 - $1000 = $1565, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It's really beneficial and it eases the financial strains on the family
17/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
17/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 305 5181: It's very clear
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 28th, 2023.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
17/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 305 5181: Yes please, please go ahead explaining
17/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 305 5181: For clarification's, I'm eligible for the 150 grand, and the amount to be paid withing the dates you mentioned above is 600 USD?
17/11/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is spot on! absolutely correct. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 305 5181: No, I stay in Mutare
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 305 5181: If I may ask, what happens if the parents and student wants to withdraw from all this process due to some inconveniences, is there a refund for any of the payments made from the very beginning upto the registration fee?
17/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if there ia any challenges that lead to this query?
17/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 305 5181: As for now, no
There isn't any
17/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for informing me. In the case of the refund policy, yes, we will be able to provide you with a refund if your situation aligns with the terms outlined in the acceptance letter's refund policy. I hope I am clear with you here?
17/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 592 0318: Good evening. As  Michelle's parents, we noted the University's name in the offer letter. We wish to know if the degrees it provides after completion of the program are recognized INTERNATIONALLY eg (BSc in Biochemistry). This is for the purpose of further studies or job opportunities in Africa or in European countries.
17/11/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, the degrees awarded by PDM University are internationally recognized. The institution adheres to rigorous academic standards and is accredited by the relevant Indian education authorities. This accreditation ensures that its degrees hold credibility and are widely accepted globally.

If you have the desire to use the degree elsewhere in the world, the degrees from PDM University will be acknowledged and accepted, enabling a smooth transition for further studies.
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 592 0318: That is great. We appreciate and enroll with the University without doubts of it's credibility
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know I am pleased to hear that. Now coming to the above payment part. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 592 0318: Thank you for the information.
However, is there someone whom we can contact who resides in Mutare as Harare is far away from us
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall come to a solution for that. If you happen make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 8:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Michelle!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

We may proceed
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Regarding to our previous conversation. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.

20/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 305 5181: I am completely out of words. 
The University is beautiful. This though piqued my interest in a very positive way. Just out of interest's sake, are the only students who take a program in any line of this only allowed in the gym or it's open to everyone?
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that , before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.

In the light of the above offer letter, we put maximum research into the University offered which is PDM University. I looked over the reviews for the University and the rankings it has and found out that PDM University is very lowkly ranked amongst the multiple Universities in India.  So my family and I came to a conclusion that we change the University. I would like to change the University and also the program I had been prior offered, which is BSc in Biochemistry. I looked up some Universities and found out that out of the many, I would like to go to LPU University and do Pharmacy or BSc in Biotechnology which would be a second option. We were 100 percent prepared to pay the registration fee this Saturday which is in 2 days as we had already set the money aside for it. Kindly, can you look into that and give us your thoughts please?
23/11/23, 11:55 pm - +263 77 592 0318: Oh yes, as parents we want to be assured that we have a good University for our daughter. And we rely that you help us .
Thank you
24/11/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Michelle!

I hope you are having a fine morning today. I was not able to reach out to you earlier as it was beyond my available hours. Thank you for expressing your concerns, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your daughter's education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching PDM University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for your daughter is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
24/11/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, PDM University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for your daughter after careful considerin. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring at the wrong place, and thus these concerns where highlighted.
24/11/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, I can understand that you wish to explore the alternatives you mentioned, specifically LPU University. In light of the same, are you aware that LPU is one of the associated universities of Edoofa and we have already shared your application with them? 

They are currently evaluating your application and once we get an update from them, we will let you know. However, to help you here in a better way, I would like to enquire if you are aware of how one's university admission process is carried out?
24/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 592 0318: Thank you for cooperating, and the anticipated flexibility We also appreciate your concerns you have mentioned in the above message However, we would like to let you know that we have already made our decision about changing the offered university (PDM). We, as a family, look forward to a positive response.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, sir. If you have made up your mind, we respect your decision. However, as your admission officer, I am keen to understand the reasons behind your decision to change the offered university (PDM). If you believe that PDM University is not the right fit and you wish to explore other options, I would appreciate insights into the specific reasons. PDM University was recommended to Michelle after careful evaluation, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, understanding your concerns will help us provide feedback to the university and assist you in making the right decision for your child's education.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's worth noting that we have been working in the education sector for over 14 years, ensuring that all the universities we are associated with maintain a high standard of education for our students. The message you shared seems to question the quality of education and directly counters the recommendation made by the academic board. With that in mind, I would like to understand your perspective more comprehensively to address this matter effectively. Could you please share your thoughts here?
24/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 592 0318: 1. As we may agree that PDM University is ranked 38th for Dental by India today, with the course that she had been prior given, it doesn't lie in the dental field. Whereas, LPU University is ranked among top 100 as a recommended University in all sectors of study generally. 

2. PDM University is ranked 768th in India and rankings are according to the quality of education provided. The rankings and the reviews provided concerning PDM University after diligent research made us discard the idea of taking up the offer to that University. 
LPU is ranked 32nd in Engineering, 17th in Pharmacy and 16th in Architecture. 
Also, Comparing LPU and PDM University, LPU is ranked number 7, and is one of the most prestigious and highly recommended University and PDM is ranked number 86 in the Private Universities category. 
With that large difference, it clearly shows which one, one would opt for.

Rankings in India: PDM - 768
 LPU - top 100
Rankings of private Universities 
PDM - 86
LPU - 7

3. Although PDM University is in the Capital, it is located in a small town and may not offer the  same range of opportunities when compared to LPU University, which is located in the larger city. 

4. The University doesn't have a strong international and national reputation which could limit the opportunities available to graduates

5. As per updated pictures of infrastructure, the Universities facilities are not up to the standards of other Universities.
From what I've seen, LPU University seems to have a more modern and developed infrastructure than PDM University. LPU University has invested heavily in its facilities, and it has several high-quality buildings and spaces for students and faculty. PDM University does have some modern buildings and facilities, but it doesn't seem to be as extensive or well-developed as LPU University or Sharda University. 
Also, infrastructure is an important consideration for us as a family and our daughter as not only do we want her to get rich tertiary education, but also to ensure that she has a comfortable stay as she's pursuing her higher education. 

Considering our background, we strongly believe and understand that the privilege or pride to come to India should be punctuated by attending higher or tertiary education at a highly ranked, infrastructured University.
