All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

21/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries about the timing; we understand everyone has their commitments. We're just thrilled to have you on board with us. Now, Mickelly, could you please provide me with insight into this message, dear?
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My name is Mickelly Mpukuta .l am very passionate about Legislative law as l have seen loved ones being oppressed because of huge  economic gaps .l intend to make my community a better place  for everyone since l come from an ecomically challenged background .That is where my passion rooted.

We are five in my family and l am the first daughter.l come from the outskirts of Harare in Riverside where there is temporary housing and it is a rural setting with no electricity or tapped water.My father is a general nurse .My mother is currently unemployed and she gets seasonal part time projects to work on .Her salary is not consistent, so the seven of us solely depend on my father's income .

The only people involved in shaping my educational plans and aspirations are my parents who also have four of my siblings and my grandparents depending on them .Therefore without a reasonable amount of assistance , getting well educated is unfeasible for me .
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this! Mickelly, your dedication to making a difference through legislative law despite facing economic challenges speaks volumes about your strength and determination. Your passion to create a better environment for your community is truly inspiring.

Your family's situation, residing in an area without basic amenities like electricity or tapped water, highlights the hurdles you've faced. Your father's profession as a nurse, despite being commendable, comes with its own set of financial challenges, especially with your mother's employment being inconsistent. It's evident that your family faces financial strain, making it challenging to afford higher education without external support.

Your commitment to your aspirations despite these challenges is admirable. Your parents' role in supporting your education while managing a household with multiple dependents showcases their dedication and the sacrifices they've made to provide for the family.
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here at Edoofa, we acknowledge the importance of education and the transformative power it holds. We're committed to supporting students like you who strive for a better future despite facing obstacles.
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you very much
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, dear. Now, may I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My mother 's name is Christina Dhliwayo and her number is +263 771 499 307.
21/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My father 's name is Leveke Seremanj and his number is +263 773 160 534
21/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: It is well noted.
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Oky .We can proceed.
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Mickelly 2K23NOV0752)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
21/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I clearly understand .Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Through my counseling sessions ,aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship programme that l am particularly impressed about are : firstly the Earn while you Learn programme .It surely helps students to cover some of the expenses.Also that there are also exposed to career guidance,some of the students need to be directed to the right career path.They are exposed to insights of their jobs like they don't base only on theory learnt in lectures .
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Also the Edoofa helps the students through all the processes and a parent is assured that his or her child is in good hands .
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your appreciation of the Earn While You Learn program is well-founded. The program serves as a significant pillar in assisting students to manage some expenses while gaining practical insights into their chosen careers. This practical exposure beyond classroom theory is invaluable, providing students with a realistic understanding of their future professions.

Moreover, the emphasis on career guidance is crucial. Directing students toward the right career path is pivotal in ensuring their academic journey aligns with their aspirations. Edoofa recognizes the importance of this guidance and aims to provide comprehensive support not only academically but also in preparing students for the professional world.
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Very clear.
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am following
22/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 337 9287: They are all clear .Thank you
22/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes please
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Please share the videos

23/11/23, 12:04 am - +263 78 337 9287: I am done with the videos .l must say ,they carry more knowledge for the students to be successful.They put more emphasis on listening to instructions and l believe one to be successful it has to do with discipline.They also talk about the Statement of purpose that will be used on the application of universities.It is very important because it acts as a recommendation to the universities so students have to be diligent .As Edoofians we should have an open mind .Also because of their 10 years of experience they know more about the schools ,not to mention one that can suit a student's strength .
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
