26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
26/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Very well
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (03rd November ) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Rutendo EWYL23E0845)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

Our commitment to equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed for success in today's world is a core part of our mission.

To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed.

26/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes you may

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective? <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I hope by Monday
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect on Monday at 2:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
26/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
30/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Good evening sir.Sorry wasn't available at 2pm but am now available
30/10/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I am happy to hear that you are now available. May I know if you were able to fill out the above forms?
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes I did but am trying scanning so as to forward to you.The first one hasn't got Rutendos photo can I send it separately
30/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I received that message for the second form
30/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed you can do that as well.
30/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that you have mentioned November 18th as the EWYL orientation session availability date. However, as we have discussed above, it is scheduled to be held on November 3rd. May I know if you are experiencing any confusion here?
30/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 391 8367: It's because the applicant will only be available after she has finished exams
30/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I can understand that Rutendo is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit her performance in the upcoming exams.
30/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if Rutendo is occupied with exams, you on her behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
30/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: She does not have a gadget  at school...she is not allowed as per school rules so she won't benefit anyhow
30/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I saw its written that the days should not be more than 3 days apart that's why I had to put the dates
30/10/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. As stated above, may I know if you might be able to attend the orientation session on Rutendo's behalf?
30/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I guess so
30/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In that case, I would like to correct the orientation availability date as the 3rd of November, and please do share it with me again.
30/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Will share tomorrow.My phone isn't working well so had to ask someone to scan it for me.
30/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
30/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
30/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
31/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes,what happens then
31/10/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that fortunate event, we will guide you through the best offer letter based on your preference.
31/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,that will be great
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
31/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Correct
31/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
31/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes we are
31/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
31/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I have
31/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today. I will be closing our session for now as I have an upcoming meeting to attend. I would like to also inform you that I will not be available tomorrow to proceed with the session as I will be on leave for my birthday. So, let's reschedule the session for the next day, which is Thursday, starting from 2:00 PM onwards. I will also be available in the evening at 5:00 PM as well.
31/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 391 8367: That's ok
31/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
01/11/23, 12:06 am - +263 77 391 8367: Happy birthday
02/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Rutendo.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed. Thank you so much.

I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.

02/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please share a picture of this document. I am failing to open it from my end.
02/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents with me. Since we have all the documents shall we now proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
02/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I understand
02/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Sorry take me back,do we get the acceptance letter before the results
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, you do not receive a letter from the university first. The admission letter from the university comes after you have accepted the offer. May I know if you are clear here?
02/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263773918367 May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further with the session and hopefully wrap up our session for today?
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: My network is on and off
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
02/11/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Does the offer letter come without us filling all the requirements
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We haven't submitted this form
02/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, what you are saying is correct. The offer letter will arrive as a conditional offer letter, and it can, at any time, change its scholarship percentage with the Statement of Purpose (SOP) and the arrival of the A-level results.
02/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
02/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes please
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
02/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
02/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
02/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We can continue
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
02/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 391 8367: It does
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: No
02/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Shed more light
02/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
02/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 391 8367: So if the student gets 2 A levels she gets 50% scholarship and if she gets more points her scholarship will be reviewed
02/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options if the result sis unsuccessful, do you agree with these?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
02/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Whilst pursuing a diploma will you still be under Edoofa
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you will still be under the EDOOFA program even if you proceed with the Diploma course.
02/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 391 8367: Then, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Rutendo to me stating that:

Greetings of the day,

That's perfectly fine, and I appreciate you attending the initial orientation. When Rutendo is available, you can continue with the session as scheduled by Ms. Jasmine.
04/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok thank you
04/11/23, 12:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Rutendo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
04/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Definitely
04/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.
