14/10/23, 7:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I am happy to let you know that I am available today a little bit early as it is the weekend and very much ready to take on our session with full productivity. Please let me know so that we can continue our session and wrap it up early.
14/10/23, 7:17 am - +263 77 234 5238: Good morning . It’s well noted.
14/10/23, 8:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready shall we proceed with the session?
14/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 234 5238: I am ready
14/10/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply. Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure
14/10/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 234 5238: I suppose we are now waiting for stage 4 since we have done 1 to 3
14/10/23, 11:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
14/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 234 5238: Let me ask Mutsawashe to do so.
14/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 234 5238: Good morning
This is Mutsawashe 
I have been busy with exams hence why I haven’t been around to answer your questions 

I dont quite remember the registration process. May you please kindly remind me
14/10/23, 11:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
14/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 234 5238: Yes. Proceed
14/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
14/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
14/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 234 5238: Very clear. Thank you
14/10/23, 11:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
14/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Well noted
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
14/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 234 5238: So the admission fee is only paid after getting offer letter?
14/10/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
14/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Thank you
14/10/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Is it. Thought you wait for Alevel results.
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Wasn’t on the same page. Was thinking stage 4 is after Alevel results
14/10/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is the weekend and we have limited time during the weekend, I will be closing our session for now. Let us connect on Monday from 3:00 onwards to further proceed with our session. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
14/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Blessed day.
16/10/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon!

I hope you have a restful weekend with your family. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
16/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Please note that Mutsawashe is writing exams so she cannot participate during the week
16/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I suggest we wait until she is done
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I need her input
16/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand. Since the course has already been decided and the universities have initiated the admission process, I wanted to inform you that we are prepared to proceed with the admission process now and reap the benefits from it.
16/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Oh okay
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 234 5238: You may proceed if that’s the case
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, could you please let me know if you are ready to move on with the session?
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Not today
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I’m busy
16/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when you might be available to do the session?
16/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Friday Afternoon
16/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We can schedule our session for next Friday afternoon. Does 3:00 PM work for you on that day?
16/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 234 5238: It’s okay
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are currently following the admission process so that we can proceed with the further steps of our session?
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I do understand
18/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?@263772345238
18/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Driving home. Network a challenge 
Read everything so connected
18/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I am not familiar
18/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Is 50% the highest Scholarship a student can get?
18/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be the minimum scholarship a student can receive under the Edoofa program, and it can go all the way up to 100%. May I know if you are clear here?
18/10/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Clear now. Was a bit worried
18/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you are now clear.  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are connected?@263772345238
18/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Connected
18/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 234 5238: This time I am very lost
18/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure! If you choose to reappear in the A Level exams (Option 1), you'll need some time to prepare and take the exams again in November 2024. After you get your results in 2025, you can join the August 2025 batch for your bachelor's degree.

During this time, due to the Endowment Plan, you'll have the support and resources to focus on your studies and retake the exams. Your scholarship seat with the university will still be saved for you for an extra year. Is this clear?
18/10/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Clear
18/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Very clear
18/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I need to show Mutsawashe tomorrow morning so that she gives her input. When we were discussing she wants a degree not a diploma and she doesn’t want gap her
18/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 234 5238: She wants to go to university next year 2024
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that she will come out with flying colors and certainly avoid these.
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 234 5238: How many points are your minimum
18/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please go through this message so that you will have a better understanding of the same.
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: I believe Mutsawashe will do well 
Her predictions were
A, A and B
Praying she can get that
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's a solid set of predicted grades! With those predictions, Mutsawashe stands a great chance.
18/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, he admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Mutsawashe's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Mutsawashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Yes. Am looking for to get started
18/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Mutsawashe's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Thank you.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Mutsawashe!
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional  University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

16/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Thank you 
1230 is fine with me
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 234 5238: That’s great news. We are excited to let you know that Mutsawashe is now back on App and she is done with exams
17/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mutsawashe,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 1:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Is this the final offer letter? Thought we would get a number so we compare.
17/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the Lovely Professional University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope I am clear on this so that we can continue with the discussion of this prestigious offer letter.
17/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 300 9465: The provisional registration fee is USD700?
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will come to that very soon. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. So, would you please let me know if we are still connected with this session so that we can conclude our session for the day? @263783009465 @263772345238
17/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Am a bit busy at the moment. Working on a report that is needed soon. Will be free next week. Can I go through later. 
Thanks
17/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, shall we proceed with the session on Monday at 12:30 PM?
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mutsawashe!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Good afternoon. You may proceed
20/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that as you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 300 9465: 1. USD975
2. 3 years 
3. USD200
4. USD700
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Yes it is clear
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
20/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Yes
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
20/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Yes it is clear
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Mutsawashe!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Good afternoon
What are the scheduled times for the sessions ?
23/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The session would be scheduled from 12:30 PM to 4:00 PM. If you are now ready and active, we can proceed consistently and conclude the session today However, if you're facing any challenges, please let me know your preferred hours.
23/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 234 5238: My worry is only getting one offer and not comparing.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Lovely Professional University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Well noted
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
23/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 300 9465: Yes
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
23/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Mr Mandinde is the best person to respond. So we wait for him since he is busy
23/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when he will be active?
23/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Not sure
23/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Will call him.
23/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly please let me know of the same.
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 227 4918: Good day. I request for flexibility to pay by 10th December since my expected receipt of funds is last day of the month.
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 227 4918: The December 2nd payment is fine.
23/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Thank you for sharing your situation. I'll certainly note the request for flexibility in the payment schedule. However, as you're expected to receive the funds on the last day of the month, could you confirm if you'll be able to make the payment by November 30th, which is the deadline for this month, speaking of which is also the last day of the month?
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 227 4918: I can't confirm until I receive the payment in my account. I can only advise you when I receive and am ready to make the payment.
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the situation, and indeed, confirming the receipt of funds before payment is crucial. Since you've been anticipating this offer letter for quite some time, could you let me know if you have made any financial preparations in advance for the registration fees?

It was clearly mentioned during the admission process that you would be required to pay the registration fees within 2 weeks of receiving the offer letter. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 227 4918: I had other pressing commitments that were beyond my control.
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, please confirm with me at the last date of the month about the payment. In the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 227 4918: I will do so.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 227 4918: I have some meetings to attend. Thank you.
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that shall we now proceed with this session @263772345238 ?
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Driving home
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please let me know once you are ready to proceed with the session.
23/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Now home
23/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 234 5238: We can proceed
23/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
23/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
23/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 234 5238: We are in Harare
23/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
23/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
23/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 234 5238: We will discuss with Mr Mandinde on the best mode and advice
23/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that works. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
23/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 234 5238: Noted
24/11/23, 10:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Mutsawashe!

I hope you are having a fine morning today. I was not able to reach out to you earlier as it was beyond my available hours.  Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Our Bank for your enrollment fee.
24/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 234 5238: Morning 
Noted
24/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 227 4918: Good morning. I will make the payment to the bank account provided on the offer letter if that is fine with you.
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply yes indeed you can make the payment through the bank details provided on the thrid page of the offer letter.
24/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 227 4918: Thank you
