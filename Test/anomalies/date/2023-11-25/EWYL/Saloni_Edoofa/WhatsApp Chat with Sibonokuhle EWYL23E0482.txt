11/08/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Sibonokuhle, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 765 0076: My long term goals are to graduate,work in a prestigious law firm and maybe one day have my own law firm .The EWYL no program gives students a platform to learn different set of skills which I can later use when I become a lawyer or build my own law firm .
11/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Impressive goals, Sibonokuhle! Your aspirations for legal excellence and entrepreneurship are truly inspiring. Recognizing the value of EWYL as a foundation for your future endeavors showcases your forward-thinking mindset. Keep embracing opportunities, and your determination will surely pave the way to success.
11/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 765 0076: No
11/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Oky ma'am now I understand

17/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

13/09/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Happy Wednesday my lovely student!_
How are you doing this morning?

Let's begin with our session👋🏻
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky Ma'am
13/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Sorry for the delay I am having problems with my WhatsApp and phone
14/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Happy Thursday my lovely student!_
How are you doing this morning?

Let's begin with our session👋🏻
14/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky ma'am
14/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 247 9106: I am good and you
14/09/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Sibonokuhle/Saloni/14sept2023*
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/09/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky
14/09/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/09/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
14/09/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

14/09/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
14/09/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
15/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky ma'am

20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

23/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, did you try calling them as well?
23/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: I've observed that there has been a two-day gap in our daily interactions. I recognize your commitment to your studies and your ongoing dedication to this program. While I understand that you might be currently immersed in your exams, maintaining our regular sessions is important. Even if we can only spare a brief moment each day, it can be quite beneficial. If you're facing difficulties in finding the time for our sessions, please don't hesitate to inform me. I can pause your EWYL Program temporarily if you prefer, until your exams are successfully completed. Your well-being and academic progress are important to us.
23/10/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM 😊 Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.

23/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 247 9106: Is it possible that you have mistaken me for another student because our sessions are on the EWLY line every Monday and Thursday at 1200 pm to 0130pm??
23/10/23, 11:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, I understand that, my fault.
23/10/23, 11:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: No the message is for you only since I won't be available during that time, that is why we will have our session on Wednesday.

07/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I want to extend my sincere apologies for my absence yesterday. I was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the grand orientation event that took place at one of our partner universities. It was an exhilarating experience, and the students displayed their enthusiasm by preparing some delightful surprises for us. This made the event truly worthwhile.
07/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I acknowledge that we missed our sessions last week and yesterday. To make up for this, I have scheduled a special 1.5-hour session tomorrow, during which we will cover all the material we had planned to address. Our session will begin at 09:30 AM and conclude at 11:00 AM. This extended session will help us catch up on everything and ensure we continue making progress as planned.
Also, from Thursday onwards, we will be beginning our preparation for our festival Diwali, therefore our session for tomorrow will also make up for for session that would have been held on Thursday. I am sure you will attend the same on the *EWYL Line tomorrow*

09/11/23, 12:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hey Sibonokuhle!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

18/11/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.
