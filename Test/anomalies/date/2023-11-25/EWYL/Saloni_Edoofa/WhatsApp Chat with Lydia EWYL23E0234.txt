How are you?

If this is the case, then we can put your EWYL Program on hold till the time you are able to put your maximum attention.
17/08/23, 10:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
17/08/23, 10:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

How does that sound?

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
27/09/23, 12:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lydia can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 432 6077: Understood
07/10/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
14/10/23, 7:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 432 6077: Sorry there was no electricity for the past 3 days

16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I can understand that.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

17/10/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Lydia and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read it.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 432 6077: The news letter does make sense and clears alot of doubts on my side dwelling on Henry Fords principle of " Giving value before seeking it".

 And I think the answer is twofold. Firstly, when you focus on giving value to others before seeking it for yourself, you're coming from a place of generosity and service. This creates goodwill and a positive relationship dynamic, which is beneficial for everyone involved. Secondly, when you give value first, you're often rewarded with value in return. So it's a win-win for everyone!
17/10/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!

01/11/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I'm excited to share some heartwarming stories of the interactions our officers have had with our students✨. These stories exemplify the strong bond we've formed and the support we provide. Thanks to the *collaborative effort between the Department of Student Welfare and the EWYL Program*, our students have not only excelled academically but have also shone in a plethora of extracurricular activities.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

It's designed to help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce and a variety of other social benefits..It can be archived through 2 separate programs one archived through creating an LinkedIn account inorder to operate with those who will be interested in Partaking or investing in the Edoofa program....Then the second program can be done through having interactions with different schools influencing them to also have their students to be part of the Edoofa program...
