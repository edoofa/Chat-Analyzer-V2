How are you?

This is how the break-up goes:

$75 if the referred student pays partial enrolment fees of $200
$25 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of the remaining $150
So, basically, $100 if the referred student pays complete enrollment
$100 if the referred student pays complete registration fees
$100 if the referred student comes to India. <This message was edited>

19/10/23, 8:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Deon!
How are you?
19/10/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would have appreciated if you could have told me earlier Deon, I would've been more happy to receive that.
20/10/23, 9:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Deon and parents!
How are you?
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263778300334 @263781122150 Deon was given an amazing opportunity a few weeks ago and she was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 9:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Deon?
@263778300334 @263781122150

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Deon, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆

15/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 88268 25411: So far l have not done anything yet
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
