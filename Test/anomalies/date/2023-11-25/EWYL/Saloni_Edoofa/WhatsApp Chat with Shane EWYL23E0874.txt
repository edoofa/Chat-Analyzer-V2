The program will also help me to be exposed to variety of skills and knowledge which i will use to help others by sharing and using my experience from the EWYL to enlighten others. I will also be able to become a successful lawyer through gaining experience in my field from the program and be able to gain greater employability
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

16/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is great Shane, I feel so delighted to meet you and get a chance to know you more in this journey!
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes i understand the objectives
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share with me about these objectives?
16/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @263787536134 can you please share?
16/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok i am sending them now i'm really sorry for late responses i will connect tó a new network so that we are not disturbed
16/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 753 6134: The first objective is to enhance student's working experience and to help students to be able to finance themselves for education. It also aims to  produce succesful studēnts who are not only employable but have a variety of knowledge through conducting various projects
16/11/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, let's discuss this tomorrow.
16/11/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
17/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 753 6134: It's nice to know them and to know they will also be helping.
17/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: They are also equally thrilled to have you in the group👏🏼
17/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
17/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes it sounds interesting
17/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It is actually!
17/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
17/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok let me read
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you read it, do let me know.
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have read the newsletter.
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have read the newsletter.
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
17/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I liked the question part which illustrátes on the need to take small steps to achieve big dreams and long-term success. Apart from this, the rest of the newsletter is also inspiring
17/11/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, I am elated to hear your thoughts!
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Shane?
17/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 753 6134: This sounds interesting and these are an exciting opportunity for me
17/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted

21/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Shane- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Whilst reading the document i have understood the need to be aware and always alert about what happens in our surrounding. I have also understood some necessary skills which include digital skills and literacy, social media literacy, teamwork and endurance skills. I have also gone through some of the EWYL projects and activities which include working towards the community and working with allies.
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is splendid, you have shared great thoughts and your version of the explanation clearly reflects clarity of thoughts🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have understood the illustration about the first program which mentions the need to connect with technologically driven companies in the market which i plan to enter, share my objectives and highlight my employability. I also have to ask some questions to different employees from different companies. This project requires me gather contact details and allows me to enhance my credibility and helping me to get industrial exposures and job opportunities
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

23/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Shane, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Shane!
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok let's get to it.

By doing this i earn scholarship credits from referring students who have completed their secondary higher education or those who are in their last year.
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Shane, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
