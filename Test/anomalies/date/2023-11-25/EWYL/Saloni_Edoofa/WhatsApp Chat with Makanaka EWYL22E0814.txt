15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Makanaka can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 1:22 pm - +49 1521 0621281: Good afternoon
22/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
26/09/23, 12:58 pm - +49 1521 0621281: Good afternoon
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Makanaka is back, he/she is supposed to note a few things.
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

Hope you are doing well.

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

How are you doing?
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Tuesday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for tomorrow's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the EWYL Group starting tomorrow. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it removes the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting tomorrow, our sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, on the EWYL Group. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.
