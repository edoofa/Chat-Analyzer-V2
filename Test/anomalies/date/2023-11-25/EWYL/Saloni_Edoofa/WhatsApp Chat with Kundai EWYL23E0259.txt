I hope you're having a wonderful day.

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects on the *EWYL Line*

02/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

23/10/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM 😊 Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.
