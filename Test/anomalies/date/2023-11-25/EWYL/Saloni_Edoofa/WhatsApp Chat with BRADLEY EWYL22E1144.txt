15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 306 9468: Noted
21/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
21/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 306 9468: Hw are u
21/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
21/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Bradley can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 306 9468: Yes we are on the same page
21/09/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
21/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 306 9468: Student is still at skul will be available when they finish their A level exams
21/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, noted that.
21/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Bradley is back, we are supposed to note a few things.
21/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 306 9468: I will make sure he gets this info soon as bradely is back
21/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please do this now, just a basic formality.
21/09/23, 1:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will tell you the further steps on the EWYL Line only.
21/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 306 9468: Tuesday and Friday
21/09/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay noted
16/10/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

I noticed that you haven't received a response from me in the past four weeks. I'd like to inquire if there have been any challenges or issues on my end that have caused this delay.
08/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 306 9468: I think the biggest issue is that Bradely muteyaunga is still at school although now sitting for his final exams
08/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 306 9468: So he will soon be available to respond personally
08/11/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Certainly, I understand that the student might be occupied but I am sure we all can spare 2-3 minutes to acknowledge these interactive messages that are meant for both, the students as well as parents.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
