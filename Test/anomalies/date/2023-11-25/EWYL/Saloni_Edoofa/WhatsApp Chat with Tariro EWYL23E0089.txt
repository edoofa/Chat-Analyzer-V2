I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

Enjoy your day!
12/08/23, 10:58 am - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

16/10/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also, as your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 21/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅: 08/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2) You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I have learnt that education gives us the keys to have a better future and hope to thrive our careers 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Although I always loved health sciences , growing up poor from a poor family and area made it difficult to have access to the fine tools to access help and support. Thus i was a pereon with no money but had a vision . So , I borrowed medicine books from the library and did virtual tours of the nursing schools and the MOMA from my home computer. I have been learning all by myself and if given a chance I could excel and hopefully become a doctor .

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? Edoofa education intends to make tertiary education education affordable and available to all considering how most universities have worrisomely become expensive in Africa.Also through Edoofa, students can pay for their own fees by attaining scholarship credits and this can help them to lesson the financial burden on their parents.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? Because I am passionate about learning.l want further my education and in the process be in a position to be accommodative as well as embracing different cultures and people.

20/10/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please ask your parents to share their views on the same Tariro?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
