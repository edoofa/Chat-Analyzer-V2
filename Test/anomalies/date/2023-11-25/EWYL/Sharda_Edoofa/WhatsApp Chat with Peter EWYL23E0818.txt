My name is Sharda, and you can refer to me as Ms. Sharda. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I hope you are doing well.

I appreciate you letting me know about your part-time job commitment. But I would also like to inform that it is important to attend the EWYL Training sessions during the scheduled time. 
You can not learn the skills and earn the scholarship credits until you are thorough with what the EWYL Projects are and what needs to be done.

23/11/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
23/11/23, 8:36 am - +260 97 9398899: Yes true
