11/10/23, 9:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Salome, thank you so much answering the questions that were shared with you.
11/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 718 4357: You are welcome.
11/10/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: *If the School is not connected with Edoofa:*
11/10/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
11/10/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: *If the School is connected with Edoofa:*
11/10/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
11/10/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
11/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 718 4357: Yes ,l agree thats true.The children will really have access to a wider range of educational opportunities.
11/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 718 4357: Alright Miss Sharda by the end of the day l will make sure l got the number of my Head mistress

But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
11/10/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].

11/10/23, 10:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100,* we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
11/10/23, 10:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
11/10/23, 10:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
