My name is *Sharda*, and you can refer to me as Ms. *Sharda*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you tomorrow i.e. 10-08-2023 from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, during which we can have a productive discussion.

May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
09/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good afternoon Ms Sharda.
Thandekile has lessons during the day.
Can we please connect at 8pm tomorrow (10-08-23).I hope this time will not be an inconvenience to you
09/08/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are glad to connect with you Ms Sharda
09/08/23, 4:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello respected parent,

I extend my gratitude for providing me with the timing information.

Unfortunately, 8 PM does not align with my schedule, as my work hours span from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Given this situation, there is an alternative time slot available from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM that we could consider.
09/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 622 4662: This message was deleted
09/08/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Ms Sharda how about we do it between 10 AM to 11AM
10/08/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in reply. By the time you texted, my working hours were over.
10/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 622 4662: Its okay. Excuse me for that
10/08/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.


I want to express my gratitude for your consideration. However, I would like to gently inform you that I have previously arranged time slots, which are scheduled from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, and another one from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. I truly apologize for any inconvenience this might cause, but I am only able to accommodate the student within these specific designated time slots. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
10/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 622 4662: Morning.  I can do with 8.30 AM -9.30 AM
10/08/23, 8:42 am - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Thandekile. Noted
10/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: How are you today?

10/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 622 4662: And how are you
10/08/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am also doing great, thank you so much for asking
10/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 360 7200: Good morning Ms Sharda. We truly understand your situation.
Thandekile will be sitting for her final examinations in 2 months time so she is  having lessons to prepare for that. We want to apologize for the inconvenience this might cause
10/08/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parent !
How are you?

Thank you so much for informing about this.
10/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 360 7200: Welcome
10/08/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: My pleasure
10/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 360 7200: We can proceed Ms Sharda
10/08/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Thandekile
10/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: In such a case we can put the program on hold for the coming two months and can resume from exactly where we left i.
10/08/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 360 7200: Think that would be the best thing to do at the moment. Once she finishes her examinations then she will be available full time. We will connect with you once she has completed her examinations
I hope this will not disadvantage her. 
Please advise Ms Sharda
10/08/23, 9:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful idea it is. 
She can focus on her exams first and then we can start her EWYL journey. 
No, this will not be any disadvantage for her. Please be assured.
10/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you so much Ms Sharda for the assurance. You will hear from us then.
15/09/23, 9:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Good evening Ms Sharda, I'm Thandekiles father. We do understand that it is critical for Thandekile to undertake the introductory stages of the programme so she can proceed with university admissions and that she doesn't lag behind on EWYL programme. It is unfortunate that our daughter is a boarder - she lives at the school. However, we will try to make some arrangements with the school head so that he grants her permission to proceed with the sessions over weekends. If the permission is granted we will inform you ASAP.
16/09/23, 7:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well. Okay noted.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to hear this. Thank you so much for your response. Looking forward to the final confirmation.

Lets continue with our plan for Saturday at the moment
18/09/23, 8:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, Noted.

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that you will be a part of.

1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things that you are  good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

26/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you for checking on us. We are praying that all goes well during her examinations.
We are unfortunately not familiar with this festival. Please share more with us
26/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes of course, everything will be alright. 
I have all my faith in my student, and she will perform great.
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly! Dussehra is a big Indian festival that's all about good defeating evil. It celebrates the victory of a prince named Rama over a demon king called Ravana. Rama rescued his wife Sita with the help of his friends and a special bow. People light up fireworks and have parades to mark this happy day.

But Dussehra is not just about a story; it's also a time for family, fun, and food. People dress up in colorful clothes, visit fairs, and enjoy yummy sweets. They also exchange gifts and greetings. The festival lasts for ten days, and on the final day, giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghnad are burned with fireworks, symbolizing the victory of good over evil in a grand way.

And the best part? Dussehra teaches us some important life lessons. It reminds us that no matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness and truth always win in the end. It encourages us to be brave and stand up against injustice. The festival also promotes unity and togetherness as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate. It's a time to forgive and forget, mending relationships and starting anew.

So, it's like a mix of a thrilling story, delicious treats, and lots of celebrations, all while sharing meaningful messages about courage, unity, and the triumph of good values in life. 🌟🤝🕊️🎆🎁🍬
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Wow. That's wonderful. Wish we could have such events in my country as well. Enjoy....

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

31/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Sharda. It is quite interesting to learn that you have activities for entertainment and socializing. Students need that time off their busy schedules to breathe and relax
01/11/23, 12:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parent ! I'm glad to hear that you find the activities for entertainment and socializing interesting. You're absolutely right; it's important for students to have some time to unwind, socialize, and relax amidst their busy schedules. It not only helps them recharge but also fosters a sense of community and well-being.
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 360 7200: True that. Thandekile is interested mainly in singing and cultural activities. It would be a wonderful opportunity for her to learn about the Indian and other cultures

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.'

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through this audio after our session today.
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/11/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
