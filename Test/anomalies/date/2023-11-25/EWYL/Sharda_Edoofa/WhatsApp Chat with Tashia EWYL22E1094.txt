Here is the message -
24/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

29/08/23, 8:42 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Student, Welcome!
Hope you are doing well!

 It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
29/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 215 7065: Good morning ma'am sorry for late responses 🙏 l was having problems with my network
29/08/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Tashia!
How are you?

It is alright. I understand your problem is genuine.
29/08/23, 9:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Should we continue the discussion about the projects from where we left it last time?
29/08/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 215 7065: Yes we can
29/08/23, 10:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
29/08/23, 10:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
29/08/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 215 7065: Yes but my school it's connected
29/08/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 215 7065: Yes
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
29/08/23, 4:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
29/08/23, 4:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
29/08/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 215 7065: Okay thank you
29/08/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 215 7065: Yes l have seen lndia's performing it on Zee world

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
