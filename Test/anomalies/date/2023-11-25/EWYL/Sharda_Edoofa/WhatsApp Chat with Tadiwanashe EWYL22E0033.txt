I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details.

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 736 9962: I understand the terms and conditions
14/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tomorrow, India will be celebrating its Independence Day. In observance of this significant national event, our headquarters will be closed for the day. As a result, there will be no scheduled sessions on this day.

I will see you on Wednesday.
14/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 736 9962: Ok thank you ma'am
15/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 736 9962: Happy Independence day Ms Tenzin
16/08/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 736 9962: Thank you ma'am
16/08/23, 10:20 am - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 736 9962: I'm ready
16/08/23, 10:21 am - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 736 9962: Very true 🤝
16/08/23, 10:24 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 736 9962: No
16/08/23, 10:31 am - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 736 9962: I understand no and I'm very happy to receive this grant
16/08/23, 10:34 am - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 736 9962: Very true
16/08/23, 10:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 10:56 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 736 9962: Ok thank you ma'am I have to go through it
16/08/23, 11:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 736 9962: My parents are not around as soon as they get back home I'll share with you their thoughts
16/08/23, 11:09 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

18/10/23, 3:54 pm - +91 76819 56989: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes this is the one.
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let's talk about something important - *the quality of referrals*. 
Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  -
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 76819 56989: Understood
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*

18/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 76819 56989: So far no challenges it only took about a week for me to understand the accent . Nowadays I can clearly understand the teachers
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's great to hear that your academics are on track. If you're facing challenges with certain subjects, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We're here to support you. As for your upcoming exams, make sure to prepare well and stay focused.
