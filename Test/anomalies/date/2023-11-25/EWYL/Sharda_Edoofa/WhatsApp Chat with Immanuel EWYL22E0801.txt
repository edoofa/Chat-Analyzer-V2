Kindly confirm your availability
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Immanuel_*
I hope you are doing well

kindly complete the following tasks as soon as possible. These are some interesting yet very less time taking tasks - 

📍 *A photo of you in your college* :

📍 *Facebook Username* :

📍 *Instagram Username*
📍 *Date of birth* -
03/10/23, 9:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
