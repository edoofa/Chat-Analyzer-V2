04/08/23, 12:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday *Chiedza*!
How are you?

Please excuse me for the delay in my response. As many Edoofians are arriving in India, i got busy with the preparations going at the backend.
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chieza

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 2:28 am - +263 77 430 8094: Hello 

Apparently it seems we have two groups you are chatting with us and it seems the other group is lagging behind 🙈or 🤷🏾‍♀️.

May you please attend to that,or should the groups continue as two am not sure.
16/09/23, 2:40 am - +263 77 430 8094: Thank you for the above program.
But since this program was introduced at Loreto High where Chiedza is a pupil, I thought if you had to request the school head to excuse Chiedza and other such students from 0830 to 0930 on Saturday and let them use their computer lab for the sessions.That would be the best arrangement.
16/09/23, 2:44 am - +263 77 430 8094: On the second option for us parents to attend sessions mid week, am not sure if it will be a once off thing or for how long ?for planning purposes.Please enlighten because lagging behind shouldn’t be an option
20/09/23, 2:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Chiedza and parents
I hope you are doing well

I have observed you have not yet decided the timing for the session.
May I know what exactly is the challenge?
20/09/23, 6:37 am - +263 77 430 8094: Morning 
Sorry for late response was trying to work out something .The issue is we currently both are working Monday to Saturday from 7am and we are home by 2000pm.
28/09/23, 1:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Chiedza*
I hope you are doing well

Since your EWYL program has been put on hold due to your exams.
Can you let me know *when are your exams getting over so that we can resume our EWYL sessions*?

28/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 430 8094: This is mainly our work schedule but if yu can squeeze in something after the said hours, it’s fine
28/09/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since there is a difference in Indian and African time zones. It gets extremely difficult to even squeeze in the time.
I hope you understand.

09/11/23, 11:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Chiedza
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

Confirming your availability for our *today's session at 8:30 am* would be the first bright spot in my day. Let's make today as radiant as the sunrise!
Looking forward to our session.
14/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As our scheduled session has come to an end, we have concluded today's session. I anticipate our next interaction tomorrow. Wishing you a productive a  day ahead.
16/11/23, 7:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: _*Greetings for the day,*_
I hope you are in good health. *Since I have to attend an important meeting today, we will not have our scheduled session today*

 Have a wonderful day. We will reconvene for our session tomorrow!
17/11/23, 11:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Chiedza,*
