16/08/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.

2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
16/08/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I would like you to tell me about what you have understood from the Program Structure.
Please go ahead.
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Ive understood ma'am that after this week we Will be meeting two days a week , either Monday and Tuesday or Tuesday and Friday.Also , there will be a lesson called Wednesday wisdom where we will cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which you will share on Saturday. Also, from what I learn  through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, I will be implementing the sama in our Saturday activities.
16/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That is a wonderful explanation. But the only correction I would like to make is not after this week but after we complete the training period which is scheduled from Monday to Friday. Then, we will meet as explained by you.
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We've covered the fundamentals of the program, the key team members, and the program structure in today's session.

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

11/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
11/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
11/09/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you*.  
Here is the message -
11/09/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

12/09/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
12/09/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?

13/09/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
13/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Goodafternoon how are youma'am
13/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes I am ready
13/09/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing good dear. Thank you so much for asking.
13/09/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
13/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I am ready
13/09/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

15/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 211 2579: *Zimbabwe back to 20-hour power cuts, with light at end of the tunnel only in 2025*

HARARE —  Zimbabwe is once again grappling with 20-hour power cuts, with no solution in sight until 2025 at the earliest.

"It's a long road ahead," Energy Minister Edgar Moyo said.

Zimbabwe's peak demand for electricity is 1,850MW, but capacity at the moment falls below 1,200MW from the country's three power generation plants: the Hwange Thermal Power Station, which produces 674MW, and the Kariba Hydrothermal Power Station, which produces 500MW.

Independent Power Producers (IPP) are insignificant with 38MW, according to figures released by the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on Friday.

Hwange's Unit 7 was taken off the grid for regular maintenance and will be brought back in a few weeks, but Unit 8 is also be due for maintenance.

Responding to questions in Parliament, Moyo said the situation in Kariba, which should normally generate 1,050MW, was worrying.

"Our normal storing capacity in Kariba is 1 050 megawatts, but we are currently running between 250 and 300 megawatts [ZESA said it's 500MW], which is already a depressed capacity of generation," he said.

He added: "We have developed a road map that has been adopted by the cabinet on how we are going to solve the energy issue through 2025."

According to the government, the country's energy needs by 2025 will be around 3,500MW.

The government is seeking to reach the 2025 targets by mixing fossil energy and green energy projects, with the private sector playing a leading role.

"In the medium to long term, the government will embrace private sector-led coal mining initiatives and new technologies such as green hydrogen, floating solar panels, battery energy storage systems, and funding some of the renewable energy projects dotted around the country in order to increase domestic generation of electricity," Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Jenfan Muswere told journalists.

The only areas enjoying unlimited access to electricity are those on the same grid as VIP residences, major hospitals, and broadcasters.

The wealthy are making investments in solar power and backup generators that run on petrol and diesel.

Solar energy is gaining popularity since it doesn't require fuel and is ultimately less expensive in the long run.

Two 24-volt panels and four 12-volt batteries make up a typical solar home station.

However, the average salary of around US$250 for government workers and other common folk makes sustainable energy an unaffordable alternative.

As a result, outdated techniques like charcoal have become popular.

Charcoal is reasonably priced for the average person. A 50kg bag lasts for a month and costs roughly US$5.50.

To manufacture charcoal, vendors harvest and burn mopani trees in the wild. 

Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is becoming more popular in urban centres.

The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) estimates that by December this year, the country would have consumed 65 million kilogrammes.

A decade ago, the consumption was just five million kilogrammes.

Still, gas is expensive for ordinary people when it sells for about US$1.85 per kg.

Bigger businesses are also feeling the effects of power outages.

National Foods, one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of food products, now relies heavily on generators, and its diesel uptake has gone up by 448%, further driving up the cost of its products.

With the problem likely to be around for a long time, National Foods is contemplating constructing a solar power station.

The situation is worse for tobacco farmers, one of Zimbabwe's major foreign currency earners.

Speaking to the state-run Herald, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) chief executive officer Rodney Ambrose said: "Growers are struggling to complete their irrigation cycles and are relying on diesel-powered generators, incurring huge costs."

Ambrose said that since using generators for irrigation was not a sustainable alternative, crop quality, output and producer viability would probably be jeopardised.

Power demand will rise even more when the irrigated crop begins to cure in early December. _*— News24*_
