08/11/23, 9:15 am - +260 96 7021828: Good morning ms sharda. I have to mention that I  mwaba:s mother, standing in for her since she is in school, writing her final exams

08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be *Mwaba’S* mentor, guide, and a friend throughout the journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are she is in India. 
Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you got an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with *Mwaba*.
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 7021828: The objectives have been shared, just that I haven't mastered them
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - +260 96 7021828: Good to have you as my daughter's mentor. On behalf of my daughter and indeed on my own behalf we welcome you ms sharda
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Mwaba* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 96 7021828: Thanks for reminding me of the objectives
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Mwaba* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Mwaba* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - +260 96 7021828: Noted
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Mwaba*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Mwaba* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Mwaba* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 96 7021828: I have gone through part of document  and I will finish it later but for now I have to attend to other issues. Can

 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*. You must learn about Diwali, *light a candle on the occasion*, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩

09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Rise and shine, *Mwaba*! Just like the sun, you have the power to illuminate the world. 

Confirming your availability for our *today's session at 8:30 am* would be the first bright spot in my day. Let's make today as radiant as the sunrise!

To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!

24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
