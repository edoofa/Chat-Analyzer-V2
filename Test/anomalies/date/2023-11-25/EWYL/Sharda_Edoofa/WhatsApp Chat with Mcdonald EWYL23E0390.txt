28/08/23, 2:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: How are you today?
29/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tomorrow marks a festive day in India 🇮🇳 – a joyous celebration of the special bond shared between brothers and sisters, known as Raksha Bandhan. 🎉 As a result, our organization will remain closed for the day. 
Hence, we will not have the sessions tomorrow.
29/08/23, 3:38 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Ok thank you mam
29/08/23, 4:30 pm - +27 84 478 0651: Happy Raksha Bandhan
29/08/23, 4:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: Thank you.
31/08/23, 1:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
31/08/23, 1:33 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Im splendid thank you and how are you mam
31/08/23, 1:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am well, Thank you.
31/08/23, 1:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
31/08/23, 1:36 pm - +27 68 159 2224: No not really,could u please explain
31/08/23, 1:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - +27 68 159 2224: I now fully understand the two goals and ready to proceed mam
31/08/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
02/09/23, 1:24 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Hi good day mam

04/09/23, 1:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
05/09/23, 8:24 am - +27 68 159 2224: Good morning ms Tenzin
05/09/23, 8:25 am - +27 68 159 2224: Today may I request we start our session from 11 to 12:30
05/09/23, 8:40 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
May I know why?
05/09/23, 8:57 am - +27 68 159 2224: Im off at work today
05/09/23, 8:59 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Message me when you are available today.
05/09/23, 11:06 am - +27 68 159 2224: Im available now mam
05/09/23, 11:07 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
05/09/23, 11:12 am - +27 68 159 2224: Noted mam,and it sounds amazing and once again I'm thrilled to be given such an opportunity to help my family with the costs
05/09/23, 11:12 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/09/23, 11:25 am - +27 68 159 2224: Yes indeed
05/09/23, 12:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
05/09/23, 12:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 12:48 pm - +27 68 159 2224: This is very enlightening and already I am eager to hear from Mr Angad more
05/09/23, 12:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
05/09/23, 1:35 pm - +27 68 159 2224: It was the quotes that touched me the most
05/09/23, 1:36 pm - +27 68 159 2224: But the whole newsletter is uplifting
05/09/23, 1:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
05/09/23, 1:40 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Yes indeed
05/09/23, 1:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
05/09/23, 4:12 pm - +91 78273 08969: There won't be a session tomorrow as I'll be at the airport to receive the students. It's going to be a great experience. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
05/09/23, 4:12 pm - +27 68 159 2224: You may ask mam
05/09/23, 4:13 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Much appreciated for the notice,thank you mam
05/09/23, 4:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
05/09/23, 4:23 pm - +27 68 159 2224: 1.we have Ms.depali the head of department of the EWYL program ,she is known for her genuine concern and care for students
We also have Ms.Davi the head coach and we will be hearing from her every week to ensure that I achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program

08/09/23, 7:07 pm - +27 68 159 2224: I have finished listening to the audio
08/09/23, 7:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

23/09/23, 12:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 12:14 pm - +27 68 159 2224: Monday , Tues and wed at 2:00 to 3:00
23/09/23, 12:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Let's meet at the scheduled time.

26/09/23, 10:18 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
