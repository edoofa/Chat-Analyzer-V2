18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 741 1646: Yes maam

30/09/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so how's your preparation going?
30/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 741 1646: I may be a little under pressure but i am managing to handle that very well
30/09/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Bright, you know, I was reading an article one day that I think can be helpful for my students who are all set to take exams.
30/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 741 1646: That will be great

30/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 741 1646: Thank very much
30/09/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 741 1646: I went through the document and understood
30/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: So do you have any specific study habits?
30/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 741 1646: I usually study from 10pm to 3 am but this timetable makes me weak at school during the day
30/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 741 1646: But i am making progress with
30/09/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Why don't you try changing your timings?
30/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 741 1646: Do you have any suggestions
30/09/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: 1. **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule**:
   - Go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, even on weekends.
   - Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, adjusting according to your individual sleep needs.

2. **Prioritize Evening and Early Morning Hours for Studying**:
   - Schedule your study sessions during the early evening or in the morning when you're naturally more alert and focused.
   - Consider studying for shorter, focused intervals, such as 25-30 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break.

3. **Break Down Your Study Material**:
   - Divide your study material into smaller, manageable portions.
   - Spread your studying over several days or weeks, reviewing and reinforcing what you've learned regularly.

4. **Create a Study Routine**:
   - Establish a daily routine that includes study time, exercise, and relaxation.
   - Consistency in your schedule can help improve overall productivity and well-being.

5. **Limit Late-Night Cramming**:
   - Avoid late-night cramming sessions, as they can disrupt your sleep and lead to daytime fatigue.
   - Instead, use the evening to review and reinforce what you've already learned during the day.

6. **Stay Hydrated and Eat Nutritious Meals**:
   - Proper hydration and a balanced diet can significantly impact your energy levels and cognitive function during the day.

7. **Incorporate Short Naps (if necessary)**:
   - If you find yourself feeling particularly tired during the day, consider taking a short power nap (10-20 minutes) to refresh your mind.

8. **Manage Stress and Prioritize Self-Care**:
   - Incorporate stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, to help reduce anxiety and improve focus.
   - Prioritize self-care activities, like physical exercise and leisure time, to recharge your energy.
30/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 741 1646: Ok maam so how do i keep myself alive when i am studying
30/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 741 1646: Coffee or energy drinks
30/09/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Before that, Can I know your school timings? I am thinking of creating a time table for you.
30/09/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 741 1646: Its from 7:20 am to 2pm
30/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 741 1646: Then i go for extra lessons after that.
30/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 741 1646: Geography from 2.30 to 4.00pm then Maths and Physics from 5.00 to 7.00pm and lastly 20.00pm i wil be home
30/09/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's very hectic, Bright!
30/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 741 1646: Yes
30/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 741 1646: But we can work with that i can manage
30/09/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: I think that after such a hectic day, you should go to bed at 10 p.m. and try waking up at 4:00 a.m.
30/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 741 1646: If i sleep from 9pm to 2am
30/09/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, you can do this as well.
30/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 741 1646: Thank you
30/09/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can try changing your timetable for a week, then share your feedback with me.
30/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 741 1646: Yes maam i will
30/09/23, 9:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now Bright let us discuss the two wo objectives of EWYL program!
30/09/23, 9:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/09/23, 9:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 741 1646: Yes i missed that one
30/09/23, 10:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
30/09/23, 10:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 741 1646: I have read it maam
02/10/23, 8:03 am - +263 71 741 1646: Good morning
02/10/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright!
02/10/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
07/10/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright!

How are you today?  It is Saturday today! Are you ready for your session?🚀
07/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 741 1646: Good morning
07/10/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright!

May I ask why are you late today? Are you facing any challenges?
07/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 741 1646: I am very sorry maam. I have network problems when there is no electricity.
07/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 741 1646: Please forgive me
07/10/23, 10:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, Bright!
07/10/23, 10:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Tell me, how was your week?
07/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 741 1646: It was super thank you for asking
07/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 741 1646: We had a lot of seminars and got to interact with other schools
07/10/23, 10:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: What kind of seminars, Bright?
07/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 741 1646: For geography
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, so how was it? What did you learn?
07/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 741 1646: I learnt the answering technique of paper1
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Bright, seems like there are a lot of network issues at your end. If you want we can continue our discussion on Monday.
07/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 741 1646: I think its now stable maam
07/10/23, 11:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. So, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 741 1646: Ok maam
07/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 741 1646: Am following
07/10/23, 11:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
07/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 741 1646: Yes it will be interesting
07/10/23, 11:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
07/10/23, 11:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 741 1646: Noted
07/10/23, 12:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
07/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 741 1646: Everything in there is touching but i liked the phrase " You will never change your life until you change things you do daily " the most.
07/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 741 1646: I think for one to be successful there is need to invest and in this case its using time wisely and acting accordingly
07/10/23, 12:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Bright?
07/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 741 1646: Sounds great
07/10/23, 12:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 741 1646: Ok
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
07/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 741 1646: Ok
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Bright!

06/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Bright, I'd like to know if you're comfortable continuing our sessions twice a week, or if you prefer to put them on hold until after your exams. What works best for you?

06/11/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/11/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I was hoping to hear from you at your scheduled  time, however 
Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
