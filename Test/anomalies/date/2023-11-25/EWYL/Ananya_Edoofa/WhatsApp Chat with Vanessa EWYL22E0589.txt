03/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:04 pm - +91 79017 68655: sorry maam  I've been postponing due to exam preparations sorry

05/10/23, 10:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Vanessa, may I ask, is it really that difficult to accomplish the necessary tasks? I believe it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete the task. It's quite disheartening when it seems like you're neglecting important tasks and my messages, especially when I'm always striving to do my best for you.
05/10/23, 10:19 am - +91 79017 68655: I sent a message maam please unless I did it on the wrong account

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.

Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.

Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.

Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 79017 68655: done
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 79017 68655: oh yes
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 79017 68655: 1. According to your own point of view,how do you think the EWYL projects will help you an individual besides earning credits?

2.What makes you eligible for the scholarship ?

3. How does the counseling you receive from your mentors help you in any way ?
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, have you noticed the sample questions, Vanessa?
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 79017 68655: yes
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 79017 68655: oooh noted maam
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 79017 68655: yes maam
15/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 79017 68655: yes yes
15/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
15/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 79017 68655: maam can you be a bit specific on what exactly you want me to explain
15/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to summarize the steps in this training, outlining the approach you will follow for your community-building project from now on.
15/11/23, 3:12 pm - +91 79017 68655: <Media omitted>

15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 79017 68655: I'm asking if I'm supposed to get the students and explain to them about that and all
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes!
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding today's session here. I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Students,

Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
