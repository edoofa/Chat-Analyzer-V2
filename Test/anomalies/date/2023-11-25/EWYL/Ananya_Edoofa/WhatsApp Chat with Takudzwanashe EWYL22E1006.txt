Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
