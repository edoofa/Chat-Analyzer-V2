03/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my students' winter break will be commencing from Friday, which is tomorrow, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step towards their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted to ask if your winter break has started or not? When would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
08/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 737 3505: Greetings mam how are you. Nowadays am not even available online since am busy preparing for the final exams, we have no winter break, we are on vacation. I don't know if it is possible for us to continue after the date illustrated by my ZIMSEC statement of entry that l once shared with you

18/09/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, may I ask if you are available today?

Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. 🍯

Now, let's kick off our session together!
21/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Noted mam
21/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since it is so long since we last connected I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
21/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Yes mam
21/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 522 7025: It's a document explaining in detail about the EWYL program and it also cosists of 3 projects; corporate alliance, building community and African schools reform mission
21/11/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Noted
21/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Well noted
21/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam, on the corporate alliance,  you have to understand the market you have to work, due to the pandemic, now companies are now technologically driven. You have to create a linkedin account to connect with componies' decision makers.
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Its a document that cosists of the 6 steps that should be taken before engaging with a company and these steps helps you understand more about the company's background using intern and other search engines so that you get satisfied first before rushing into engagement with a company that you're not fully knowledgeable about
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Thank you mam
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am concluding today's session. It was great talking with you! Time for me to sign off now.

21/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Thanks mam have a blessed time.  I enjoyed too
23/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Afternoon everyone
23/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Isheanesu!

Did you know that Africa is the second-largest continent, covering over 30 million square kilometers? Now, let's begin our session and explore the rich and diverse tapestry of knowledge awaiting us today!
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Alright mam
23/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

23/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 522 7025: Noted mam
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
