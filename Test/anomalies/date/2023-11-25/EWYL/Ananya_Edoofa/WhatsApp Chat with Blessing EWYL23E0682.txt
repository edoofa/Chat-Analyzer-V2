She is currently in school, so I am reaching out on her behalf to express our excitement to begin her EWYL Journey
 As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 22/09/2023 to commence the procedures. Please schedule my session for the same date so that we can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
22/09/23, 5:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Sir! 

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, Blessing's mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟

*Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30AM*
                              OR

22/09/23, 5:31 am - +263 77 493 1133: Monday to Friday, 2:00PM to 3:00PM.
22/09/23, 5:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! Let us connect today at 2:00 PM then!
22/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
22/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good afternoon. We can proceed.
22/09/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
22/09/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you very much Ananya for such an inspiring introduction.
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome, Sir!
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 493 1133: You may help by explaining them to me.
22/09/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure! So the  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted, thank you
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Done
22/09/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you.
22/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Blessing* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 493 1133: It really sounds interesting, but we will not be able to have Blessing connecting to the program as of now until 17 November 2023. She is currently at school as I highlighted in my introduction where she has not access to WhatsApp due to strict school regulations. So if its ok with you, we may reschedule all the sessions directed to her up to the 17th of November. Any inconveniences caused are sincerely regretted.
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, we can have  Blessing with us after November 17th! These are the basic details that are important for us to share with the student or the parent.
22/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you very much for your cooperation. Anywhere, if there are any sessions direc
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: If there are any sessions for the parent, we can connect and proceed as per schedule.
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Blessing* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I am done.
22/09/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Blessing*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Blessing* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 493 1133: That's great. You will have our support in ensuring that you achieve these three goals for our daughter. Thank you.
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Blessing will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our conversation here, we shall connect on Monday at the same time as we do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday! <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted, enjoy your weekend.
22/09/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Same to you, @263774931133

25/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good day, how are you. Yes we can begin our session.
25/09/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, may I ask if you were able to read this document?
25/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes and I am still going through it.
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Blessing* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Blessing* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make the mentor trust the student fully
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
25/09/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
25/09/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This is the platform where Blessing will connect with me once she is available. So kindly share the message on the Line so that I can keep track of it and can easily connect with her during an appropriate time.
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263774931133 

How are you doing? Can I know the estimated date by which Blessing can connect with me?
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good morning Ananya. Blessing should be back home on the 18th of November 2023.
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for the information, @263774931133
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: You are welcome.
19/10/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

30/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263774931133 @263716796852 @263773298426 

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 493 1133: We are very sorry for not acknowledging your previous communication @Ananya. It really slipped off our minds but we have taken note of your concern. Thank you very much for checking on us. Going forward, we will ensure timeous communication so that we remain on the same page.

Sorry for the inconveniences caused.
31/10/23, 7:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Blessing and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 679 6852: The key factors include strategic focus,a well focused student is most likely to be able to achieve their goals.Also courage can be helpful, as a student will be willing to take risks to complete their tasks.
17/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Blessing!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 679 6852: Morning
24/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Blessing, to begin with take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.
