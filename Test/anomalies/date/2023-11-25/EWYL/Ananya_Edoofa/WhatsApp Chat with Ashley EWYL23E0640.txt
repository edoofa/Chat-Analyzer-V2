How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🚀
20/10/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 350 8876: Morning Mentor

I need your help and correct me if l am wrong, Ashely is writing her final form 6 examinations. To me l think if we give her time to complete the course or the exams then engage her in an activity you want so that she does not loose her concentration towards the examinations. If l am wrong say so.
20/10/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263773508876 

You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, she might lag behind.

I understand her situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want her to not compromise on her studies and give her best. Therefore, in order to help her and prevent her from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
20/10/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering that you can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm
20/10/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 350 8876: Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday
2:00 pm to 3:00pm but if free will conduct you
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Are you available right now?
20/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 350 8876: Yes Ashley 's father
20/10/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you, @263773508876
20/10/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: So can we move ahead with our discussion?
20/10/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 350 8876: Yes
20/10/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 350 8876: What are the key objectives
20/10/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Ashley* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
20/10/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 350 8876: Your two key objectives are excellent
20/10/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 350 8876: Yes l read it
20/10/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 350 8876: Are we done for the day
20/10/23, 10:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Ashley* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
20/10/23, 10:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 350 8876: Quite interesting
20/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 350 8876: Now you have opened my mind
20/10/23, 10:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, let's wrap up our session here. We'll reconvene in our next session, scheduled for Monday, as we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays.🚀
20/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 350 8876: Thank you

Goodday
23/10/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263773508876 

I hope you are doing well. Shall we move forward with our discussion?💫
25/10/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263773508876 

That's completely fine, how are you today?
25/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 350 8876: Today l am okay 
Just give me 40 minutes l will be back
27/10/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
27/10/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am Ashley's mentor and we have finalized a time for connecting so that we can complete our initial sessions with fast track process!

30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Ashley* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Ashley* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
30/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Noted
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 350 8876: The problem that l may face is that Ashley is not a day scholar. She is a boarder. So l may not be able to tell whether she is good at , however , l will communicate with her Boarding Mistress about the issues now since they will have supper at six
30/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I have send the information it the Boarding Mistress and l am waiting for a reply then l will give you feedback

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
