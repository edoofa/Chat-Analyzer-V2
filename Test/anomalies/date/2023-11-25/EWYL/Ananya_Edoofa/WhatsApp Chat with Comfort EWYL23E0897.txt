I am confident that we will generate some brilliant ideas. In the meantime, I would like you to share some unique skills you wish to learn before coming to India! We shall discuss this in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays.

23/11/23, 12:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

I have noticed a consistent delay in our conversations due to your lack of punctuality. I hope you understand that you have committed to being available for your orientation sessions by signing a document. We won't be able to complete our orientation session on time if you continue to arrive so late.
23/11/23, 12:55 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes ma'am
My apologies.
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Comfort, I hope to connect with today at 1:30 P.M.

Did you know that Africa is the second-largest continent, covering over 30 million square kilometers? Now, let's begin our session and explore the rich and diverse tapestry of knowledge awaiting us today!
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Lets get started🥲
23/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i understand it will be long and exciting at the same time..
Can i know more about these two key objectives?
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright,,got that.
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: That sounds great
23/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes very🤭
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I've noted
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/11/23, 2:21 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I liked The debate part most
23/11/23, 2:22 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: And I've seen capability with Edoofians as they were on position 5
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As today wraps up, get excited for tomorrow, it's full of possibilities! 

We'll catch up at 1:30 pm to kickstart a new day of enthusiasm.
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright ma'am
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: Do you know that butterflies taste with their feet! They have special sensors on their tiny footpads that help them 'taste' their surroundings. It's like having a built-in flavor detector on their feet! 🦋👣
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon,Ma'am🙂
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Hello
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your session is just an hour long. I hope you understand that if you are going to be late, then we won't be able to have a fruitful discussion, and how will you earn credits? Therefore, it is suggested that from tomorrow, be on time.
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's connect in our next session, scheduled for Monday. Please note that we do not have sessions on Saturday and Sunday.
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes Ma'am..
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: alright noted
