08/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Takundanashe!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.
08/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I would recommend you consult your admissions officer for the same as they are the best people to guide you in this matter.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us move forward by discussing the credits associate with the third project.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2  The *Scholarship Credits* earning opportunity for this project!
1. On every successful call/ email Response by the school to Team Edoofa- you will be awarded $2
2. Once the group or the process begins- you will be awarded $10 worth of scholarship credits
3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!
18/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 384 0518: Understood

20/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 384 0518: Ok thank you
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Takundanashe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 384 0518: We are on the same page Ms Ananya thank you

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

As per our discussion, Takundanashe will resume his EWYL Process on 13 November. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with the student and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
21/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 384 0518: Ok will do that madam ,thank you

30/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Takundanashe!

As we immerse ourselves in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, Dussehra, and Durga Puja here in India this month, I can't help but be curious about the incredible *cultural festivals* you celebrate in your beautiful homeland. 🎉🕯️

I've shared stories about the festival of lights, the triumph of good over evil, and the worship of the divine feminine. However, you have never mentioned anything about your *culture and festivals*. Now, it's your turn to enlighten me about your favorite festivals from Africa!🌍🌞

 I am also excited to see some photos and videos from your festive time!  Let's embrace the spirit of *cultural exchange*, and let our screens be filled with the magic of your celebrations.🎆✨

30/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263773840518 @263713644123 
I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 384 0518: Sorry madam there was network challenges here I was going to reply sorry again for that
31/10/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm eagerly waiting for the beautiful pictures and videos from your end as well.
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Takundanashe and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
