Our names are Dennis Milanzi and Ms Peggy Mutale Milanzi. We are the parents of Mwenje Milanzi. Our daughter's EWYL Group name is Mwenje EWYL23E0694.
We are reaching out on her behalf as she is in school to express our excitement with her EWYL journey.
We are available for 27/09/2023.
Schedule our session.
27/09/23, 8:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents! 

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, Mwenje's mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30AM
                              OR

Our preferred time is Monday to Friday between 2pm to 3pm

27/09/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Meanwhile, , to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
27/09/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are alright and how is it going with you
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now,  I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/09/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7798912: *Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL* Program is an innovation of Edoofa that builds the capacity of students while at the same time exposing students to projects where they earn points. The students gain excellent work experience and also access an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that are equal to physical cash. These credits can be used to pay off a reasonable portion or part of their higher education fees there by making their university education more affordable.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7798912: Noted
27/09/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I have gone through the newsletter
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7798912: Good afternoon @918800325457
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7693061: Greetings too and good afternoon
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are alright and how about you
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, @917428445625 @260977693061
28/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Mwenje*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Mwenje* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 7798912: @918800325457 
Thank you for the direction. This is helpful to us.
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Mwenje* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
29/09/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🏆
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: @918800325457 
How are you doing?
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are ready
29/09/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you for the document. Is it the one we were supposed to receive yesterday?
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes @260977798912
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you for this
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Mwenje* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Mwenje* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
29/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7798912: This is helpful indeed
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
29/09/23, 2:41 pm - +260 97 7798912: Does it mean we will move away from this WhatsApp group and begin to engage direct to the EWYL Program line only?
29/09/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, this is the end of the initial sessions. When Mwenje comes back, we will connect through this EWYL Line. Is that alright?
29/09/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it's understood
29/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In order to do that you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
30/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977693061 @260977798912 

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 7693061: Thank you so much. The video was timely
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 7693061: And helpful at the same time
31/10/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I really hope that these insights will be fruitful for your future endeavors.
31/10/23, 6:16 pm - +260 97 7693061: Surely, they will
31/10/23, 7:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

23/11/23, 9:02 am - +260 779747930: What I understand is that I have to meet the needs of EDOOFA and to do that I must spread the word about the program. It also talks about the skills I must have to communicate well with people,how I must reach out to companies that I'm supposed to work with. It also talks about the processes I must go through before enrollment.
23/11/23, 9:04 am - +260 779747930: I must also spread the word about Indian schools to the schools in my region. It also says what type of behavior I must portray as an EDOOFIAN student.
23/11/23, 9:06 am - +260 779747930: And also how to fill in my application.
23/11/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

24/11/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the "barkless dog" because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a "barroo," due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +260 779747930: No I did not know that
24/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!
