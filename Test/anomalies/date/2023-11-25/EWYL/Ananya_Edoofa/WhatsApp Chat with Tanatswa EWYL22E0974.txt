You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Yes mam
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilitie
16/08/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I am ready for

Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I will improve and continue doing so, I hope I won't let you down mam
16/08/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I will mam,
16/08/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Sure mam
16/08/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

20/10/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Tanatswa! However to add subtitles to a video, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Transcribe Your Video:** First, you'll need to have a transcript of the spoken content in your video. This can be done by typing out what is said in the video as accurately as possible.

2. **Choose a Subtitling Software:** There are various software tools available for adding subtitles to videos. Some popular options include Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Aegisub, or online tools like Kapwing and Subtitle Edit.

3. **Import Your Video:** Open your chosen software and import your video file.

4. **Create Subtitle Tracks:** Most software allows you to add subtitle tracks or layers. Create a new subtitle track for your video.

5. **Add Subtitles:** Start entering the text from your transcript into the subtitle track. Make sure to specify the timing (start and end times) for each subtitle or caption. This is crucial to sync the text with the video content.

6. **Format and Style:** You can typically customize the font, size, color, and position of the subtitles. Ensure that the subtitles are easily readable and complement the video.

7. **Review and Adjust:** After adding subtitles, review your video to ensure they're properly synchronized. Make any necessary adjustments to the timing and formatting.

8. **Export the Video:** Once you're satisfied with the subtitles, export the video with the subtitles embedded.

The process may vary slightly depending on the software you use, but these are the fundamental steps for adding subtitles to a video. Be sure to check the specific instructions of the software you're using for more detailed guidance.

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
