You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?

12/08/23, 11:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Greetings maam. Im ok with the new timetable
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

https://youtu.be/-RZ86OB9hw4?si=67Pz56KNwC7OFkEe
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam
11/10/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Thandiwe, tell me, what did you learn from the video? You know, this video was shared by my professor when I was a student, and this is something that really stuck in my mind this morning when I was thinking about your sessions.
11/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I learnt that I should not stress too much because this will have negative impacts on me and my health. I also learnt that exercising helps to relieve stress and socialising with your family and friends also help to reduce stress.
11/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Stress can cause headaches, sleeping disorders and anxiety which makes one lose focus
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Thandiwe! Good work.🏆
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience through the video really helped. That's why I would also like you to create a video for your community.
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 956 8110: ok maam i will definately do the video
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Talking about the video, you can include the following points:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 956 8110: We are on the same page maam
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now I want you to create this video by Friday evening.
11/10/23, 4:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am pleased with your response and performance.

Take care and goodnight!
11/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Goodnight maam
13/10/23, 12:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
