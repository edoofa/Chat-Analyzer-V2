Hope you're doing well  please. 

I came across a challenge here,  one of the school heads I reached out to give me his back. I was not quite sure about his name so i made a mistake on tying his name. He saw the message, i  confirmed that through a blue tick but Sir didn't respond. 
I thought it's because he was not interested having his name misspelled.

Now I have the correct spelling can you assist me with a message to get back to him.
02/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Pritchard let me frame a message for you.
02/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Greetings, sir,

I sincerely apologize for misspelling your name in my previous communication. It was not intentional, and I deeply regret the error. I have been making continuous efforts to reach out to you and connect.

Please accept my apologies and kindly respond at your earliest convenience. I value the opportunity to communicate with you and want to rectify any misunderstandings.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

09/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *TUESDAY* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

21/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 580 0065: A moment in life back during my high school, I was doing my  11th grade at one of the schools in Buhera, Makumbe High School. I used to study Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry with Mr Mushandu, Mr Rugare and Mr Natsira respectively lecturing the  subjects. I started my studies in the month of May 2021 as per the tentative opening date. Two months after our Physics teacher was transferred and the school find it harder to quickly replace him, it took almost a year without our Subject teacher. I have had nowhere to find my lectures which meant that I have to do it on my own . I was a newcomer,  I used to have a few friends especially on my subject area .
I told myself I have diligently work on my syllabus, it was hard to focus on the tasks I have scheduled on my own but there's nothing to do with it . 
I kept up with hard work until the school staff plans to present a teacher, by then it was 2 months before our final examinations. I was determined all along and at the end I came up with good results.
