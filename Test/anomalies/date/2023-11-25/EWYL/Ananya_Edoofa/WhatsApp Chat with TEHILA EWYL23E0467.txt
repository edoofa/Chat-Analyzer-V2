28/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977850766 

How are you?
28/08/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 7850766: Fine thank you and how are you
28/08/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to the new members who have joined our group for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am Patricia Lukwanda Tehila's mother
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 7850766: My name is Tehila Yalubamba .
28/08/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you!
28/08/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/08/23, 3:01 pm - +260 95 0590514: Waiting to hear from you
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 95 0590514: Ok
28/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 7850766: I have understood .
28/08/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
28/08/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 7850766: Okay thank you
28/08/23, 3:09 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thanks
29/08/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 7850766: I'm online
29/08/23, 9:31 am - +260 95 0590514: Good morning
29/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
29/08/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7850766: Good afternoon yes
29/08/23, 2:16 pm - +260 95 0590514: Yes
29/08/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
29/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:32 pm - +260 95 0590514: That is very encouraging.
29/08/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7850766: That's interesting
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/08/23, 2:51 pm - +260 97 7850766: Thank you
29/08/23, 2:56 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thank you
29/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7850766: It's a very encouraging news and I most say it is very interesting to read .
29/08/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐

Therefore, we won't be connecting tomorrow, we shall connect on Thursday now!
29/08/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 7850766: Wow I have heard so much about that day . So Thursday it is then
29/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The festival is tomorrow and we will be connecting on Thursday!
29/08/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7850766: Oh okay all the best in the celebrations. Thank you
29/08/23, 3:12 pm - +260 95 0590514: OK  you have a rich culture we envy. All the best

01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
01/09/23, 9:40 am - +260 97 7850766: Noted thank you I will let you know when I have sent the mail
01/09/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 7850766: I have sent them .

08/09/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tehila!

I am good, I want to ask about these images. I could not understand the importance of them in your EWYL group. Can you please help me understand the same?
09/09/23, 2:39 pm - +260 95 0590514: Sorry posted in the wrong site
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 5:05 pm - +260 95 0590514: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 2.00pm to 3.00pm
19/09/23, 8:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let us connect today at 2:00PM
19/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 8:29 pm - +260 97 7850766: The whole afternoon my phone call not connect until now
20/09/23, 7:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, shall we connect today?
20/09/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 7850766: Thanks
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 7850766: Yes
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for NAME’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tehila?
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +260 97 7850766: That's sounds okey am Tehila's mother she is still at school they are not allowed to have phones
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, ma'am!
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that NAME will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am done
20/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tehila can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7850766: Ok
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am ready
21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, Tehila may I ask if you wish to move forward with the next stage or you wish to continue with this next stage once you are done with your exams?
21/09/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am Tehila's mother she is at boarding school and phones are not allowed
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Tehila’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.

As per our discussion, She would resume his EWYL Process on 16 November 2023. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
21/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 7850766: Thanks
19/10/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Take a little break, relax, and let this video inspire and motivate you. You've got this! 💪
Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thanks I will send it to my daughter
20/10/23, 11:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can also watch the video and share the key points or insights you gather from the video I shared? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts so that I can share more of these in the future!
27/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm also curious to learn about your cultural festivals. Why don't you share some photos or videos of your cultural festival?
28/10/23, 12:30 pm - +260 95 0590514: OK I will do that
31/10/23, 6:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tehila and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:16 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thank you very much mentor
07/11/23, 8:17 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am half Zimbabwean am able to hear the words from the song
07/11/23, 8:18 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am excited for my daughter
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260950590514 @260977850766 
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 9:16 am - +260 95 0590514: Good morning, I didn't know that the Basenji dogs are the ones  who are barkless.
24/11/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Tehila, your session is just an hour long. I hope you understand that if you are going to be late, then we won't be able to have a fruitful discussion, how will you earn credits? Therefore, it is suggested that from tomorrow, be on time.
24/11/23, 9:21 am - +260 95 0590514: Ok
24/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me, Let's connect in our next session, scheduled for Monday at 8:30 am. Please note that we do not have sessions on Saturday and Sunday.
