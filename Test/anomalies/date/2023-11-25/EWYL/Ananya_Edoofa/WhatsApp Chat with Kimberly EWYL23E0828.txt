01/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Yes i'm all ready thank you
01/11/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
01/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 695 1156: My best part of the newsletter were the quotes. They were all so inspirational to me.
I was also inspired and encouraged to try out new extra- curricular activities ,things I have never done before.
I sure will be doing a lot of that
01/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Yes indeed. I noticed so many Zimbabweans were mentioned there. I would so much love to be outstanding and have my name mentioned in there too
01/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed,  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Kimberly?
01/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Amazing.i will certainly adopt those goals and work hard towards them
01/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
01/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
01/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 695 1156: My EWYL mentor is Ananya. She has a passionfir studying biology and is dedicated to ensuring the student achieves their career goals with less strain on their personal budgets. The entire 5eam aims to ensure that they offer equal opportunity to every Edoofian and help them self- finance their education
01/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 695 1156: The 3 goals st by my mentor are
1.make sure to excel in my academics
2. To ensure I am given enough opportunity to self finance my education in India 
3. Ensure that I attain my ultimate goal to move in line with the digitalizing world
01/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Mr Angad Singh interacts with all students via the newsletter
01/11/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 695 1156: The hall of inspiration is an opportunity given to students to try out new things so that they learn to be able to face challenges that always arise in life. The students get involved in new extra-curricular activities and that helps sharpen their minds and learn how to overcome challenges
01/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay. Thank you very much
02/11/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kimberly! 

I hope you're all feeling refreshed and ready for an exciting session ahead. Let's dive into our learning journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. 🚀💡
02/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Good afternoon Ms Ananya.
Good to join you again this afternoon
02/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you were able to read the document?
02/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 695 1156: I read part of the document  but was just finishing it off now ma'am
02/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
02/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Briefly,I understood that the Earn While You Learn program is aimed at equipping the student with skills that help them project what the business world will look like in the future. This will then help the student to keep abreast with the ever digitalizing world and thereby ensure they don't become redundant in society. The program also helps to lower educational expenses by earning points that help to cover fees. In addition, the student positively impacts the society,particularly the youth as the student is always up to date with modern technology
02/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Kimberly!🌟
02/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Thank you
02/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay. Thank you
02/11/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
02/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 695 1156: It is of paramount importance to know the type of market that you will be dealing with once you achieve your career goal. Since most companies have since moved to online market and operations,it is important that one links with influential personnel from those companies via the Internet,particularly the LinkedIn account. Communicating and setting up organised meetings with these and the Edoofa team will help the student to familiarise with the digital world and also makes it easy for one to get a job in their country of origin,thus ploughing back into the society.
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Noted. Thank you
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
02/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay
02/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, I am so excited to tell you that we are going to our orientation program tomorrow at one of our partner universities. I will be meeting my students for the first time, and I just cannot contain my excitement.🎉

Therefore, we shall now connect on Monday since tomorrow I will be at the university, and we do not have our sessions on weekends. See you, Happy weekend!🌟
02/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 695 1156: When searching for companies,the aim is to get companies that are willing to assist in the overall development of the student. 
First check if the company is academic,recreational or content oriented.
02/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Ohh great ma'am. Can I continue with the summary for the company search guide in our next meeting?
02/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Or I can still submit it even after close of session?
02/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes you can submit it Kimberly!
02/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay.thank you.

02/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Secondly one needs to ensure the company is neither too big nor too small,between 50-100 employees.
The third aspect is to check the financial stability of the company and lastly the background of the founder and then connecting with them,sending them an invite for a meeting as well.
To check for all these and connect, one can make use of various platforms such as Google and LinkedIn and social media pages like Instagram. It is important to read around the companies and familiarise with their operations and their founders.
06/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Good day to you Ms Ananya.
I hope you had a pleasant weekend.
I am very glad to reconnect with you this week. I have been looking forward to this day

Start implementing these invaluable tips today and watch as your dreams unfold before your very eyes
08/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Thank you very much ma'am
08/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay. Thank you
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Okay.i understand it ma'am
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

Best of Luck!

08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

This project aims at mobilising more students to join the program through their schools.
The Edoofian is encouraged to reach out to schools in their locality,talk the the principals to allow them to share with students why they joined Edoofa,their future plans and the benefits of joining Edoofa.
They also have to make sure they arrange an online meeting of Edoofa directors and the school principal.
The Edoofa team has made it easy for the student to communicate with the principals by designing a template that will assist them
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over. Let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time, I hope to have a fruitful session tomorrow!🌟
