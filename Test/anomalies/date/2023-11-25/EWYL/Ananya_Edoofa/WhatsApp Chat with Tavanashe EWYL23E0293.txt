28/08/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to gently remind you about something important. It's regarding the $300 plan that we discussed earlier. In order to fully enjoy the benefits of this plan, it's necessary for you to have a *discussion with your parents* about it and also to write a *letter* to me.
28/08/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Please keep in mind that I'll need to share the finalized list with the department *tomorrow morning*. I genuinely care about your success and don't want you to miss this opportunity. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
29/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 238 3659: Good evening. I trust you are all well. My apologies for late response. My day was a busy one today. Here is my response....You will remember that some time back we discussed the EWYL program and Tavanashe indicated that the projects were too involving and could have a toll on her school work if done concurrently. Ms Ananya confirmed that the projects were not compulsory and that many students don't participate in projects but still remain under the scholarship. We would have loved to benefit from the EWYL program but unfortunately it seems as if it is too involving and may affect her school work.

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 07:00 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday
📅 28/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 07:00 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

08/11/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
