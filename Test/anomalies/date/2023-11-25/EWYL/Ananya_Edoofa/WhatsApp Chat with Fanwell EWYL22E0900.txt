Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday for our session as I was preparing for the arrival of our 2023 intake students!

However, I have rescheduled your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM, and I am sharing our weekly newsletter with you, which we will be discussing tomorrow. I hope to see you there!
01/08/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: For now ma'am  I'm waiting for my admission officer mr Shivjeet to tell me the date of arrival
05/08/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am,  I'm waiting
05/08/23, 10:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that you have been quite occupied with your preparations. However, I would still appreciate it if you stay connected on your EWYL Line. This will allow me to share lessons and activities with you, and whenever you can find some time, you can share your responses. This way, your attendance can be maintained.

So, kindly follow your EWYL ritual so that I can share your activities with you!
05/08/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am thank you
12/08/23, 11:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

14/08/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I am waiting for you on your EWYL line, kindly join me there to proceed with your session!
16/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Greetings ma'am
16/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, how are you today?
16/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 076 0225: I'm fine ma'am and you
16/08/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am i agree with you
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am  i understand on that, but we were faced challenges,so  that's why sometimes  we didn't meet those targets
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am thank you i believe and confidential that, i  can surpass grant amount by own schoolarship credits by  being hardworking
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright i will rewiew to them
16/08/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
24/08/23, 8:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I want to let you know that there's something we need to address concerning your grant. I need to tell you that today is the last day to submit the signed grant document.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳
