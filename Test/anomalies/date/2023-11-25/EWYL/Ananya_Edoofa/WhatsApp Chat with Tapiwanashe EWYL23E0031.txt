12/08/23, 11:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀
12/08/23, 11:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 1:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can write an email to deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com
16/08/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Well understood ma'am
16/08/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Yes ma'am I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Yeah
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 169 5804: That's great, I've understood that
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Yeah, firstly, it keeps me occupied, no time for unnecessary movements and it also allows me to pay off my fees without putting pressure on my parents
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I believe your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Well thank you ma'am
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 405 1433: Thank you Ananya for this unwavering support and love.continue moulding my son for the fulfillment of his vision.we are really settled in our hearts to know that he is home away from home
16/08/23, 4:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, @263774051433
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 169 5804: Thank you ma'am, you are the best mentor ever, thank you for your support
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 405 1433: Tapiwanashe, stepping stones make you reach greater heights fluently and smoothly.grab the chances and make use of them wisely for the betterment of your future.commitment and hardworking must be your motto.Thank you once again Ananya.stay blessed.
16/08/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
16/08/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

To begin with, I believe you must have joined the Career Launch Pad group for your training and internship, haven't you?
18/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 78145 60435: Yes I joined ma'am
18/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, you know, while I was going through that group, I came across a very interesting Tech Tip Tuesday series! Did you see that too?
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +91 78145 60435: Yeah I saw it,  was about the chart gpt
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you share any specific ways you think ChatGPT AI might be useful in your studies or future projects based on what we discussed in the last class?
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78145 60435: It helps me to get instant answers

18/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 78145 60435: They were not so difficult
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - +91 78145 60435: Sounds like a pretty good idea, I think I will be able to do so as well,
18/10/23, 4:30 pm - +91 78145 60435: Most of the students I talk to, they complain about the money needed
18/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, start reaching out to other students then!
18/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.Absolutely! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I hope you will be able to create a video by Friday evening. Now, let's conclude today's session. We will connect according to our timetable.

19/10/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tapiwanashe!

I have an update to share with you regarding your student application forms. The following students have not responded to our counselors' messages. I suggest that you connect with them once and understand what has really happened. You can also suggest that they at least connect with the counselors to discuss their career paths.

-Bote Liberty
19/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also,  while I was recording your student applications, I saw the other student applications you shared with me. I learned that Takesure Madzongwe is in the final stages of eligibility.

Do you think it would be very helpful to the students if you could communicate with him or his family about everything here in India? It could significantly assist them in moving closer to the scholarship program. What do you think?
19/10/23, 3:03 pm - +91 78145 60435: Let me do so ma'am
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78145 60435: I think it'll be a great idea

20/10/23, 1:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tapiwanashe!

I noticed you've submitted a video for the video editing internship application. It's great that you're eager to showcase your skills. However, for this type of opportunity, it's important to maintain a professional image.

Here are a few suggestions to enhance your video:

Dress Professionally: Consider wearing formal attire to present yourself in a more business-like manner.

Add Subtitles: Subtitles can make your video more accessible and demonstrate attention to detail.

Incorporate Transitions: Smooth transitions between scenes can make your video more engaging.

Include Creative Elements: To stand out, you can add creative elements like animations or special effects to make your video unique and memorable.

Remember, this video is your chance to make a strong impression, so it's worth putting in the extra effort. Good luck with your application!

I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.

Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78145 60435: Okay ma'am
15/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, but since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session here.

I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
