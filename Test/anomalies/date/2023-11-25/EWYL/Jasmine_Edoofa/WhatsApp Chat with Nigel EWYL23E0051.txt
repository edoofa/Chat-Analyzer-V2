26/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 927 6631: My journey to India
Hello reader, i hope this finds you well. This is an article that focuses on my journey from my mother country to this stunning country India. To start with, my name is Mujiche Nigel a young man aged 19. I have came from one the difficulty background. I was raised by my mother and father. I am the first born in a family of 4 children thus making us 6 in Total. 
For my academics i went to Nhamburiko primary school situated in Kuwadzana for my Primary level! I went to Tafara 2 High school for my Ordinary Level where i scored an amazing chain of A's and came out with flying colours. I took an opportunity to learn from a scholarship from Kingdom Worship Trust  an Organisation that focuses more On God provision. I completed my Advanced level at Twin one Academy. I enrolled myself toEdoofa after an introduction from one of my beloved friends. Surprisingly an offer letter from MVN University for Bachelor of Commerce. I payed the $1000 which was needed fpr my admission and scholarship reservation. I wa suppose to start learning on the 6th of August but things were tight for my family as we had no money for basic expenses as well as the flight ticket. Like they say fate favours, i was able to find the money after a month. After using Emirates as my agent i visited India on the 19th of September. And to tell you it was my best trip in my life as i was experiencing this trip for the first time. When i arrived at Delhi international airport i was welcome by angelic welcomrs as well as melodious Hindi. I couldnt understand what they singing but the vocal was very touching. At he airport i was welcomed by Ms Kirti and Mr Shivjeet. I was exvited to meet tgis guys we got time to speak amd from them i heard unique ideas that im still using now also they gave me a summary about India. From there i was taken to my university where i met some African and Asian friends.

17/10/23, 9:35 am - +91 89304 23526: As I have messaged them some are at school now that's why they are replying late and also the Upper 6 are still writing their examination

I hope your day is off to a fantastic start. I hope you remember we have our session scheduled for today from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm. However, I believe that one hour might not be enough for us to have a thorough and meaningful conversation.

*So, this is why I'd like to offer you some flexibility regarding the timing because I know that you also have a packed schedule. So,  I'll be available to chat with you from 4:30 pm to 8:00 pm today.* Kindly feel free to join me within this timeframe to ensure we have ample time for our discussion. 
_*I'd appreciate it if you could let me know if this arrangement works for you.*_
18/10/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you realize that I've offered this flexibility because I want you not to miss our session today. I've gone the extra mile to ensure we can have our discussion today. So,  make sure you're able to participate in our session.
18/10/23, 10:00 am - +91 89304 23526: It's OK ma'am
18/10/23, 10:00 am - +91 89304 23526: And I'm fine thank you I hope you are well too

18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort.

18/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us need a better understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - +91 89304 23526: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
Are we both on the same page?
18/10/23, 3:54 pm - +91 89304 23526: Ma'am haven't I made the same video this week.?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
