*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. This is to inform you that students who come to India are offered some special benefits and now you are also one of them. _These benefits have been thoughtfully curated to alleviate the financial burden on both you and your beloved parents._

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

09/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Austin_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*
*2. We'll also connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp for more accessible interactions in sessions.*
09/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss.
09/10/23, 3:42 pm - +91 89686 21125: its clear mam
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability.
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - +91 89686 21125: Ok mam
11/10/23, 3:24 pm - +91 89686 21125: I will give them more information about Edoofa
11/10/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - +91 89686 21125: Yes we are mam
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - +91 89686 21125: Ok mam
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:05 pm - +91 89686 21125: Ok mam
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.

I'd like to address our scheduled call from last Saturday. While reviewing our past conversations, I noticed that the call was missed. In such situations, I believe it is essential for the student to inform us in advance if they are going to be unavailable for the scheduled call.
