She is currently in school, so I am reaching out on her behalf to express my excitement to begin her EWYL Journey.

May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?

03/11/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First thing first, *_Congratulations_* ✨
On being awarded the Edoofa scholarship, Makanakaishe! This is a fantastic opportunity to expand your horizons, gain new experiences, and make memories that will last a lifetime.
You should feel proud of this achievement, as it is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and determination.
This scholarship is an opportunity for you to grow as an individual, learn about new cultures and ways of life, and achieve your dreams.
All the best!
03/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you, surely we have taken this as a great opportunity to get to know new cultures and way of doing things in an international way.
03/11/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Ideally, our initial orientation involves a comprehensive discussion with students about the mission and vision of the EWYL PROGRAM, followed by a detailed discussion of the various projects. 

However, since you mentioned that Makanakaishe is not available for morning sessions, we will conduct a brief orientation with you. We will provide you with an overview of the program during this short session. We kindly request that you share this information with her or ask her to review the conversation at her earliest convenience. Our full initial orientation process typically spans 2-3 days. May I know if will you be able to attend the session for the next 3 days?
03/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I will inform her. May I know if you hold the sessions over the weekend too? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No, we willl be starting with this schedule from Monday.
03/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I will be available.
03/11/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

03/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, thank you very much.
03/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you very much, I'm sure she's ready too to walk this journey with you.
03/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Welcome, I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met.

 Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 368 2925: Two objectives am not sure can guide me there.
I think it has to do with her chosen career that you will be there to guide her. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Makanakaishe is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
