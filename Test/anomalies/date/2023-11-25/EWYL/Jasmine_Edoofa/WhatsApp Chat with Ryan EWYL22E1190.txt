04/08/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 561 0490: I am currently doing the preparations and l will arrive there in India on the 6th of September
05/08/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 561 0490: Well ,now l have packed some clothes ,2 bed sheets,a laptop and a cellphone only
05/08/23, 9:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Are you going to live in campus or off campus?
05/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 561 0490: In campus
05/08/23, 9:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, What about the snacks, some food and toiletries?
05/08/23, 9:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you thought of buying them when you are here?
05/08/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 561 0490: That is what l would like to hear from you?
05/08/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 561 0490: Will it be possible to buy them from that side?
05/08/23, 10:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: See, I would like to give you my personal suggestion. For the initial few days, I believe that you should carry everything. For example body lotion, carry a small one

05/08/23, 10:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I think you will initially take 2-3 days to settle in and get used to everything. You don't want to rush to the shopping as soon as you arrive. What do you think?
05/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 561 0490: That is absolutely right, you're correct Ms Jasmine
05/08/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 561 0490: Your advice is very helpful, l  will certainly comply to you idea😊
05/08/23, 10:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That will be great. Once you are completely settled then you can go out and get all the necessary stuff.

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters.

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

08/11/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
