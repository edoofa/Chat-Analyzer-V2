As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️
17/08/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @27849053856 @27611955443 @27747458105 
I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*
IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION

17/08/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you all are perfectly fine. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - +27 74 745 8105: I understood that for one to receive the Edoofa grant one would hav earned a certain number of credit,that the credits cannot be shared with someone else,that the credits can only be used to pay ones tution fees only
17/08/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - +27 74 745 8105: Yes
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
18/08/23, 8:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning*

29/08/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
