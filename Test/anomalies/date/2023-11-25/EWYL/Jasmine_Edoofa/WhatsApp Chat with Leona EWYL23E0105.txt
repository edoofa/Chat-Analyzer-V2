You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off. 🌟

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Kindly take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our sessions, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

15/08/23, 1:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️
15/08/23, 1:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do let me know how you have celebrated the day ☺️
17/08/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @27737503488 @27786584246 @27784162843 
I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:12 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We will have signed the letter by  Wednesday.

 They are currently at work but they were very proud when they received the news!
17/08/23, 3:13 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We appreciate the grant
17/08/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Leona, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - +27 78 658 4246: I understand
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - +27 78 658 4246: If I may ask: I paid my fees through Edoofa but it has not been updated at the financial office so my attendance is blocked currently and I have 0% attendance but have been attending all lessons.

How can I handle that to ensure that my grant/scholarship credit is not revoked due to a low attendance percentage.
17/08/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: If you have paid your fees then it will be updated.
Also as soon as you inform me about your situation then your Grant won't be revoked.
17/08/23, 3:34 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We paid last week but Mr Mukund has not yet sent the proof of payment to the school to update them on the fee payment so my attendance is still blocked
17/08/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me look into this.
17/08/23, 3:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have informed Mr. Mukund and I will get back to you when I will get the update.
17/08/23, 3:41 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Thank you very much for your assistance Ms. Jasmine. I appreciate it.
17/08/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
17/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Thank you very much Ms. Jasmine. I will continue to show my dedication throughout the journey. I appreciate your guidance!
17/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Before we end the session I wanted to share Application forms with you.
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Leona, I would suggest you wait for a day. I want to take a call with you beforehand and then you can submit the forms.
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - +27 73 750 3488: I really sppreciate the EDOOFA family and cmmumity in all the efforts to better my daughter"s promising future goals. I salute your cause!
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very touched by your kind words.
