I hope this message finds you having a wonderful day!

As we approach the scheduled resumption date for the Earn while you learn (EWYL) program, I wanted to check in with you and see if you are all set to resume. I am excited to continue this transformative journey with you and provide the support you need to thrive in your personal and professional growth.

May I know if we can resume the session?
10/08/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 101 3858: She's at school doing Vacation School for Form 6.

Thank you
10/08/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 101 3858: 16 August - 30 September
10/08/23, 1:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Thank you for the information.

23/09/23, 9:02 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 361 8650: Good morning! Here it's still in the morning (1030hrs).

Anyway, getting back to our issue, I think your student will not be able to connect with you during the said Saturday sessions because:
1. She's at a boarding school where they're not allowed have and use phones. 
2. They'll be having studies during weekends for she's going finish her final Exams on 16 November 2023.

For me as a parent, I think I'll try to connect with you on Wednesdays 2.00pm to 3.00pm, that is, if I happen to be free because at my work place I don't have free time on all the week days. 

I hope you will consider my situation as working parent. 

Thank you
23/09/23, 10:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Thank you for informing me.
23/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 101 3858: You're welcome!
29/09/23, 12:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Tadiwanashe,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

Thank you for connecting! However, your messages most reach me well after hours you have sent them. This side of the country is giving us problems in connecting with people, especially at the times of need.

However, if we receive the message in time we are free to connect at the time you are free.

Thank you for your commitment to the programme.
