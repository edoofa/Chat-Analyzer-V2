10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.

In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I will try to be active
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay i understand
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay noted
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure but next week I will be starting my exams
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Alright, here's my suggestion: for this week, please plan to attend the sessions from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. Then, next week, remind me, and I will make the necessary adjustments to your session timings. Does this arrangement work for you?
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes sure
10/10/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
10/10/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
