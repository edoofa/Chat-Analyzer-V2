As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

16/08/23, 12:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_* ☺️

It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +91 75081 21739: Okay ma'am well understood
17/08/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 4:01 pm - +91 75081 21739: So far everything is clear
17/08/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant.

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
