I hope your day is off to a fantastic start. I hope you remember we have our session scheduled for today from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm. However, I believe that one hour might not be enough for us to have a thorough and meaningful conversation.

*So, this is why I'd like to offer you some flexibility regarding the timing because I know that you also have a packed schedule. So,  I'll be available to chat with you from 4:30 pm to 8:00 pm today.* Kindly feel free to join me within this timeframe to ensure we have ample time for our discussion. 
_*I'd appreciate it if you could let me know if this arrangement works for you.*_

I hope you're feeling fantastic. I'm absolutely thrilled to kick off our session by sharing an exhilarating video with you. It's all about a remarkable individual named Felix Baumgartner, who dared to take a free fall from space! 🚀

23/10/23, 8:01 am - +91 89689 73376: Good morning ma'am, i have a student who have ran into a problem on filling the offline application form. She said her mother deceased when she was young and her father left her with with her grandmother and never came back so on the offline application form for that part which requires mother's and father's information what will she write

23/10/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon, Desire,
I trust you're doing well. I recently watched your video, and I wanted to express my delight at the successful completion of all your tasks. Your video was exceptionally well-crafted, Desire. I'm genuinely impressed by your eloquent delivery and your adept editing skills.
23/10/23, 8:56 am - +91 89689 73376: Oooh, I'm glad you are pleased ma'am. Thank you
23/10/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I empathize with the situation the young lady is facing, Desire. However, it's essential to remember that this scholarship program is only partially funded i.e. 50-100% Scholarship, and financial resources are required for her to pursue this opportunity. She should consider mentioning the person or guardian who will be supporting her financially throughout this journey.
23/10/23, 9:21 am - +91 89689 73376: Ok ma'am, let me update her on that. Thank you
23/10/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *TASK FOR TODAY*
I'm confident that you're already familiar with the $300 plan and that you've begun taking steps to work on it. I would like to encourage you to discuss this plan with your parents so they can be informed about this opportunity and potentially assist in easing the financial burden.

Once you've shared the details of the $300 plan with your parents, kindly ask them to acknowledge it within this group. This way, we can all be assured that we are aligned and moving forward together.
23/10/23, 9:37 am - +91 89689 73376: Ok ma'am, but I've already told them, maybe it's just they forgot to acknowledge it, I will remind them on that ma'am
23/10/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, That would be great Desire
23/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 562 8656: Greatings, Desire told us about the $300 dollar plan and we are aware and comfortable with it.
23/10/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great and thank you for the acknowledgement.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I trust you're having an excellent day! I assume you caught the latest webinar. Could you please enlighten me on the key takeaways from the session and your impressions of the speaker Mr. Ian? I'm eager to learn what motivated you the most about him. 

Take a moment to reflect, and I look forward to your response within the next 20 minutes.
20/11/23, 1:10 pm - +91 89689 73376: Good afternoon ma'am, sorry i didn't see the message earlier. Ok from the very profitable webinar we had with Mr. Ian about self actualization and building success. Self-actualization is the realization and fulfillment of one's talents, potential, and capabilities. It is also important to note that self actualization is not actually about doing something for money or to gain firm or popularity but it's all about doing something because you just have this desire to do it and you know you are so good at it. More so, never give up on anything good you are doing in life no matter how *NOs* you get from people who might help you grow. Mr. Ian said just know that keep working hard and know that behind that no there is someone waiting to say *YES* and that's when the whole world will recognize your greatness. Mr. Ian really motivated me especially and i think I'm heading for greatness now
22/11/23, 8:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Wednesday lesson will delve into an exciting and essential topic: "The Power of Competitive Spirit: A Catalyst for Growth and Success."

In this lesson, we will explore how embracing a competitive mindset can be a driving force behind personal and collective achievements. We'll examine real-world examples that showcase the transformative impact of competitive spirit on innovation, resilience, and overall success.

Understanding the dynamics of competition is crucial in today's rapidly evolving world, whether you're navigating your academic journey, planning your career, or considering the broader societal landscape. This lesson aims to provide valuable insights and inspiration as we explore the stories of individuals, businesses, and nations that have thrived by fostering a competitive edge.

Come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions, share your perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of how the power of competitive spirit can shape our paths to success in our upcoming session.

Best regards,
