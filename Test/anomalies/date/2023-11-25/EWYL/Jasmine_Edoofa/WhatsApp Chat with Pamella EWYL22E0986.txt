I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

09/10/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Pamella_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*
*2. We'll also connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp for more accessible interactions in sessions.*
09/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss
09/10/23, 4:07 pm - +91 89689 32503: It's fine
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability.
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +91 89689 32503: Okay
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 89689 32503: Okay
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - +91 89689 32503: Yes
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 89689 32503: Yes
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 89689 32503: Yes
11/10/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:26 pm - +91 89689 32503: Okay
11/10/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.
