Journaling helps individuals recognize their triggers and sources of stress , leading to leading to better self-awareness and emotional regulation by clear that is reinforcing positive habits and intentions by focusing on daily wins and areas of improvement, by adopting a daily journaling practice and also by dedicating a few minutes each day to this reflective exercise individuals can gain valuable insights into their lives and gradually build a more mindful and intentions approach to their actions and decisions.

29/09/23, 2:32 pm - +91 70424 78306: Alright ma'am
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - +91 70424 78306: Okay thank you
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +91 70424 78306: Alright
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ANOTIDAISHE/ADITI/29SEPT23*
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
29/09/23, 2:41 pm - +91 70424 78306: Alright ma'am I understand

29/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 70424 78306: Alright ma'am
29/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/09/23, 2:58 pm - +91 70424 78306: Noted Ma'am

04/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming your sessions along with this you can share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
04/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
04/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
04/10/23, 2:26 pm - +91 70424 78306: Okay okay

04/10/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
04/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 2:46 pm - +91 70424 78306: Yes he was supposed to come at school today
04/10/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wow! That's amazing.
04/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving forward, now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
04/10/23, 2:59 pm - +91 70424 78306: Okay ma'am
04/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

Q1. Please mention the name of your African school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
06/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 70424 78306: 1 My African was Chindunduma 1 High school. It is not connected with Edoofa yet
First I will share my great experience at my African school the I will tell them how great Edoofa is and my experiences with Edoofa then I will tell them about EDOOFA 2ith the aid of photos of course and ask them to connect with my mentor Ms Aditi
3 it s located in Mashonaland Central province
06/10/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
06/10/23, 2:41 pm - +91 70424 78306: Yes ma'am I have his tag
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
06/10/23, 3:14 pm - +91 70424 78306: Got it ma'am

You too have a wonderful weekend
09/10/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope that you are in excellent condition!

So I hope you are ready to commence the session.🚀
09/10/23, 2:20 pm - +91 70424 78306: Greetings ma'am
09/10/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I hope everything is clear till now.
09/10/23, 2:24 pm - +91 70424 78306: Yes Ma'am
09/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
09/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - +91 70424 78306: Oky noted
09/10/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
09/10/23, 2:41 pm - +91 70424 78306: Ma'am sorry but can you explan this for me
09/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure Anotidaishe!
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If the school's fees per term are less than $100, we don't usually have a school call with Edoofa's Program Director. This is because we're not sure if the students from that school can afford around $2000 for their higher education.
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope it's clear till this point?
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - +91 70424 78306: But ma'am what if those students have  family members to help them
09/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: In such cases, we suggest that students create a WhatsApp group. In this group, they should add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the school's headmaster/principal/contact person.
09/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After creating the group, there are two options:

They can ask the headmaster/principal/contact person to add students who can pay around $2000 for their higher education. Once added, they should inform them about Edoofa and share the community-building form.

They can ask the headmaster/principal/contact person to share the contact details of prospective students with you. You can then add them to the group and educate them about Edoofa. Afterward, you can inform them about Edoofa and share the community-building form.
09/10/23, 2:56 pm - +91 70424 78306: Okay ma'am I understand
09/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
09/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey.

09/10/23, 3:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and now we have successfully completed the project's discussions.
09/10/23, 3:07 pm - +91 70424 78306: Surely ma'am it if

It was lovely talking to you. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. Let me brief the call for you- 

1. From now onwards, you will get 300$ for Community building.
If a student pays enrollment fees (200$) - You will get 75$
When the student pays the remaining 100$ -  You will get 25$
When a student pays the Registration fee (School fees) - You will get 100$
When a student comes to India - You will get 100$

2. You can redeem your Scholarship credits only 2 times a year
04/11/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to create a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

A) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

08/11/23, 4:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 6:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

19/11/23, 6:22 am - +91 70424 78306: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?

 The Edoofa Program has an application process where you are required to share your educational and family background in detail for them to understand your aspirations, and prepare for higher education abroad and qualify for the selection process. The first step of the application, the form that you’ll submit will be evaluated on priority for your free career counseling session with an expert academic career counselor.

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?

initially I chose the Edoofa program because of its authenticity and affordability.the admissions was the first step of the program. I was promised assistance with my accommodation, registration, and documentation. 
There is also a separate Department for student welfare set up to assist you and guide you on how to settle in India at your college.

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.

The Edoofa Program is an International Education Scholarship Program that has its mission to make its students- us EDOOFIANS, Employable. And they do it by their EWYL program. As a part of this program, we Edoofians get the opportunity to learn and enhance our skills by working on real-time projects that we get from industry leaders. We also get access to internship opportunities, and live webinar sessions from African CEOs, and business owners to get the desired exposure. The most interesting part about this program is that as a part of this program, we can self-finance our education over and above the scholarship that we have gotten based on our merit.
I have my seniors who have paid the entire fees by working and earning credits. They are my inspiration.

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?

It has been 3 months that I have been living in India and even though it took adapting to the environment, weather, and culture, it is so gratifying because it is a country full of resources that are affordable. It doesn’t feel so far off from home. We go to Church on the weekends, we have our church community that we spend time with praying to the Almighty. My counselors told me about India being one of the highest growing economies before I came here but now that I am here, the sheer ambition and drive that Indians have to excel at everything is nothing short of an inspiration. Their high-quality teaching, research, and development facilities/laboratories, growing infrastructure.
However, as an international student, making an informed choice is extremely Important. I am glad I have Edoofa every step of the way to guide me to make the right choices.
