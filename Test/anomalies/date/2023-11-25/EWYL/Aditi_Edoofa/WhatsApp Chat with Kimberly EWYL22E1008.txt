06/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 289 9744: Good morning. 

Since this ewyl programme is for Kimberly 's benefit to earn some funds like what was said earlier.  As a parent l would like to suggest that she takes a break from it because l find it too demanding hence she is failing to balance her time. She might resume the programme later after she has adjusted to college life and has learnt how to manage her time. For now may you spare her. Thank you.
10/10/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263772899744 !
Hope you are well.

10/10/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

21/10/23, 11:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to creat a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Thursday!
I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

09/11/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also Kimberly, may I please have the video that you must have created as assigned to you for the task?

How are you today?

I hope your Diwali break was an absolute blast! 🎉 Any thrilling stories or standout moments you can't wait to share? 🌟 As we dive back into things, I'm eager to hear all about the excitement and joy that filled your holiday. 😊✨
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Your immediate attention to this matter is expected.📍
16/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 289 9744: Like l said earlier, we were told this programme is about making extra cash or getting credits.  Is it forced to get extra money or its for those willing to get extra money.  It becomes worrisome when our child is being threatened on this platform . I suggested earlier to please give her a break from ewyl. She has to concentrate on her  studies that is her main agenda. Please let's be on the same page and let the child acquire academic knowledge.
22/11/23, 8:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263772899744 @263771969504 
Hope you are well
22/11/23, 8:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: I appreciate your concerns, and I completely understand the importance of focusing on academic studies. Your child's education is indeed the top priority. Regarding Kimberly, I had a conversation with Mr. Sagar, and she expressed her eagerness to continue the EWYL journey while ensuring it doesn't interfere with her studies. She's committed to striking a balance and will be available for her sessions.
22/11/23, 8:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: We are aligned on prioritizing Kimberly's education, and I assure you that we'll work together to ensure the EWYL journey complements, rather than hinders, her academic pursuits. Open communication is key so I would appreciate her communicating her issues with me. <This message was edited>
