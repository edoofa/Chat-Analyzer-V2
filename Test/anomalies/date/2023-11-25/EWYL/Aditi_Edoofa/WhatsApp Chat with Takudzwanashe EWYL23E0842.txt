24/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 817 5746: Okay they are both my parents who are sponsoring me and supporting me  ,they may not be able to be available in all my sessions due to work but they always make sure to do follow up of what has being discussed in my sessions.
24/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's completely understandable, and it's great to hear that your parents are supporting and sponsoring you on your journey. Even if they can't attend all the sessions due to work commitments, their dedication to following up on the discussions shows a strong commitment to your progress.
24/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 817 5746: So in these sessions are they supposed to participate that much?

24/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 817 5746: Please explain
24/11/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/11/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 817 5746: Okay well understood that was clear
24/11/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 817 5746: I'm glad to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi looking forward to travel this amazing journey with you all.
24/11/23, 10:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 817 5746: Yeah it is
24/11/23, 10:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 10:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 10:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
24/11/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 817 5746: Hie ma'am l haven't done with the documents yet in travel and I'm having disturbances.
24/11/23, 10:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
24/11/23, 10:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
24/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 817 5746: Okay thank you ma'am
