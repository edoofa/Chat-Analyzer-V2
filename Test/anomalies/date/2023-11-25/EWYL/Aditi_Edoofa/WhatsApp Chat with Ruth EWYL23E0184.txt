16/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Ruth!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Greetings... Let me inform my parents and see if they are able to attend the sessions
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
19/09/23, 1:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Ruth, can you please add your parents in the group, so that I can also have a conversation with them. <This message was edited>
