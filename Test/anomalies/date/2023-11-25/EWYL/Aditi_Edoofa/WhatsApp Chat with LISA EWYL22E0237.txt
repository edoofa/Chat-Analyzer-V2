I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 12:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes
16/08/23, 12:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 924 2804: I really appreciate the opportunity to be seen as a role model by other students
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes
16/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 924 2804: It also motivates me to work even harder to earn more credits
16/08/23, 12:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 924 2804: I truly appreciate you and the whole EWYL team for acknowledging my efforts
16/08/23, 1:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am, thank you
16/08/23, 1:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 1:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 2:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 292 4338: Hello Ma'am truly I'm filled with pride and joy for my child's success and achievement. I am so grateful to you the EWYL team  for giving my child the chance to go for the Grant Challenge  I forever remain grateful

16/08/23, 4:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to creat a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
21/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am ,sorry l had network issues before
21/10/23, 1:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, Lisa!

01/11/23, 12:12 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings! I'm Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, EWYL, and I hope this message finds you and your parents in good health.

04/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 924 2804: The students l share with about Edoofa drop out after a few counseling sessions or face other challenges then drop out before coming to India so is there any alternative way for me to earn scholarship credits that involves me working individually not depending on other people like in this case l have to depend on students' willingness and seriousness to come to study here for me to earn scholarship credits
04/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 924 2804: Then how many credits are the to my name as of now if any
04/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 924 2804: ...link?
04/11/23, 12:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Lisa regarding this as you know Mr. Mukund is there every week, so you also might have noticed that he wasn't there last week as he himself wasn't well and as under the communications with the University we were under the impression until yesterday that she was back from the hospital. Yesterday we were in the orientation as you must be aware.
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct Lisa, currently your the application forms you submitted those students haven't enrolled yet, so you haven't earned much credits but don't worry try harder you will earn.

08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, a lot of you struggle at performing these projects and in pursuit of your success, here I am sharing a few key points that will help you excel at your projects.
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Waiting
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: A big part of our journey as an Institution has been our community of students. I believe that we exist only because of our students. I am able to create opportunities because of our students and hence the Community Building Project is utterly crucial to us and our institution.
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Noted
08/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project. As all of you are aware the rewards/credits for this project have been revised and increased to 300$, which calls for better performance, increased effort, and a better approach to the project. Let’s learn more!
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Following
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have observed that honesty, transparency, and authentic conversations with people lead to the best results. Since you are here in India, and I am aware that a lot of you are grateful for it, the objective is to share that feeling with the things that you love in your new life. The sheer convenience of having a nonstop supply of electricity, and availability of internet that is almost as good as free- resources that were way more difficult to achieve back home, All of your brothers and sisters deserve those same opportunities.
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 924 2804: That is true but nowadays Edoofa has become so well known that a person can just apply on their own from an online application form
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So you should convince them, there must be somebody back there who must be convincing them.
Sharing a story, even if it’s your own, is an art. It builds confidence, creative expression, empathy, and perspective and improves presentation skills. With this project, we are going to train you on all of these skills and also help you by sharing what you can actually tell them when you talk to them. I will also empower you to select students who you want to be a part of the community which will be based on your criteria of whether they are ready for this opportunity. After your training, you will be involved deeply in shortlisting the applicants before they submit their applications.
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Noted ma'am
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 6:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now your task is to answer these questions then I will share the answers of the same.I hope it's clear.
18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.
4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay maam
19/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 924 2804: 1.The best way to fast track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program is to avoid the online application rather get someone like a student who already enrolled with Edoofa and could be currently learning in India itself they have a first hand connection with the Edoofa people and can connect you directly there by fast tracking your application.

2.I chose Edoofa over other agencies and consultancy because for them it's not just about the money they actually care about our welfare as students , they do not leave us to fend for ourselves after arriving in India , they continue checking on us trying to be there every step of the way and being there to solve any problems if ever we encount them

3.What makes the Edoofa Scholarship Program more unique is probably the EWYL program.This is when small tasks or projects are allocated for us as students by our mentors .In doing these projects we  actually stand a chance to earn scholarship credits .And the good thing about this is they are not limited but you can earn as much as possible depending on the amount of effort you put in. These are not given as hard cash but are directly deposited into the school account there by lessening the burden of fees on your parents.

4.I think the most remarkable thing about India is the affordability of quality education .Unlike the education back home ,here our learning process is not just theoretical but very practical as well .We get to do a lot of experiments depending on your faculty.Then through Edoofa we are assured of job opportunities once we finish so this is basically everyone's dream since there are a lot of educated people back home who are jobless .
20/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Wishing you a marvelous Monday and a week ahead filled with exciting opportunities.✨

20/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 924 2804: Okay
20/11/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Lisa, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.


And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆
21/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 924 2804: I have gone through the document
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263719242804 
Hope you are well.

Amazing, I hope that now you are well aware of the steps.
