01/08/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kudzai.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you were able to fill out the counseling feedback form by now?
01/08/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Good evening how are you

01/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 813 5023: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 813 5023: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
01/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes we are available
01/08/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes let’s start
01/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 813 5023: You can start explaining
01/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes they are
01/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I am
01/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 721 6269: it was mentioned in the acceptance  letter for Edoofa that upon securing the scholarship letter of intent from the respective university  a registration fee of 5o0 to 75o dollars will be charged.However this registration  amount will be adjusted in the first year fee when one arrives in India effectively making registration fee $0

is the true
01/08/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 721 6269: stage 6 is clear
01/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, it is absolutely true.
01/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Is it okay if we can proceed tomorrow my battery is dying
01/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely fine, I will share the videos now, and you can go through them by tomorrow and we shall reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 PM.
01/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Thank you
01/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
01/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

02/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

02/08/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, I shall wait for your response for the video understandings.
02/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright I will be explaining starting from video one till the end
02/08/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Video 1 which is Important Massage for Enrolled students the founders have explained very well about the Edoofa giving reference to the pictures on the wall those success students who qualified to be part of the Edoofa program.They mentioned that the students are provided with life transforming education and they are also provided with the earning while you learn program which helps students feel independent .The Founders also mentioned their visit to Africa.They said that there were lots of students who came so I understand that the Edoofa program is appreciated all over in Africa .The last but not least the very important lesson I have learnt from the massage from the Edoofa founders are that students should be teachable and open minded and that students should follow Edoofa instructions 

Video 2 which is Edoofa vision for the students the Founders gave an example of a student of Ghana whom they had a video call interview with and through that example I’ve understood that Edoofa is supportive and is focused on the success of students.The Edoofa wants affordable quality education for everyone.It also wants to make students employable through the SEEL program .The founders explained about the students of Edoofa earning while learning to success.It is also focused to increase students capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent
02/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the other video responses.
02/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Video 4: preparation for interactive session with schools 

The Founders stated clearly about the SOP.it is the subjective document that allows one to convince the admission board or any school or why one is worthy of the scholarship or admission in school and it includes things like the achievements,unique traits ,one’s abilities etc and this increases the changes of one to get maximum scholarship. The Edoofa team will provide the documents like the individual documents and their recommendations on the student on the student’s behalf .The SOP from my understanding is an important document and students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form
02/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I am typing
02/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, I shall wait for it.
02/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 813 5023: From video 3  the Founders mentioned that it is very important to know about the universities.They said that there are a lot of requirements needed for a student especially foreign student to be admitted in the universities so one has to be careful. They gave good example of agents who can not be honest enough about a particular university and they don’t consider if they meet the expectations of a student as they do it more for money . The Agents take Education for business but the Edoofa is more concerned on the quality education for students and delivering best services .The Edoofa identify and gets institutions that are run by authorities . The founders also mentioned that the Edoofa convinces the universities to give Edoofa students scholarships. The universities work with the Edoofa for the benefit of the students.The Edoofa partners with worthy schools for students that will deliver quality education for the students. I understand that Edoofa’s major concern is on the benefit of the students and that they are learning happily and putting their smiles on their faces through the universities in which the Edoofa helps them to get admission.I have also learned that I can trust Edoofa
02/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 813 5023: This has been my understanding from the four videos you shared with me

Thank you
03/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudzai.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your response and I can see you have a great understanding of the videos. In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kudzai.

04/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
04/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright I’m glad to know
04/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 371 2371: Yes my understanding from what my daughter has explained to me about the videos is that SOP is to prove her abilities and her vision and her academic progress
04/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you are absolutely correct @263783712371

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 09.00 pm.
04/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

07/08/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 813 5023: 2.Yes there is such a thing as social structure. Social structure refers to the organized patterns of social relationships and institutions that shape our lives. These structures can include things like families, governments, and economic systems, as well as the norms, values, and expectations that are associated with them. These structures can have a significant impact on individual behavior and can be thought of as constraints on individual action.

For example, the economic system in a society can shape the opportunities and resources that are available to individuals, which in turn can influence their behavior and choices. In a capitalist system, for instance, individuals may feel pressure to work hard in order to succeed financially, while in a socialist system, individuals may have more access to resources like healthcare and education but may face less incentive for hard work. Similarly, a society's political system can influence the rights and opportunities available to individuals, and the cultural norms of a society can shape people's beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.

It's also worth mentioning that these structures are not fixed, they can change and evolve over time, and often times shaped by individuals and groups. People can work to change the structures in place and create new structures, through for example activism, lobbying and political process.

3.)The difference between sociology and economics 

SOCIOLOGY 
1.it has a wide scope because it studies all the types of social relations 
2.it is abstract in nature .it’s variable are very difficult to measure 
3.It is general science 
4.Social relationship is the core subject matter of sociology and it study man as a social animal 
5.It is young science 
6.Sociology is the study of man
7.Economics is influenced by sociology
8.Property system,division of labor,occupation etc are provided by sociologists 

ECONOMICS
1.It has a narrow scope because it studies economic institution and economic activities of a man
2.It is concrete in nature 
3.It is special science 
4.Production and distribution of goods and services are the basic subject matter and study man as a wealth disposer 
5.It is an old age 
6.Without economic conditions the study of society is quite impossible 

4.)Institutions perform positive functions in a society .It is a mechanism to govern the behavior of individuals within a given community.It makes the society function.They work as a back born of the society.Without the social institution a society cannot achieve fulfillment in terms of economy,academy or relationships.When there is no rules and regulations in a society people are more likely to indulge in crime and other harmful activities.Sociology institutions help in taming such activities.They contribute in organizing the society and its people.They come with a set of rules and norms to ask people to follow.

5.)In sociology primary groups are defined as small intimate groups of people who share close personal relationships and emotional bonds.These groups often involve face to face interactions and a sense of shared identity and values.Examples of primary groups families,close friends,small teams a d groups.Secondary groups on the other hand are larger ,more impersonal groups that often come together for a specific purpose or goal.These groups may not have close personal relationships or emotional bonds, and interactions are often less frequent and less intimate.In-group members have positive views of each other and give each member preferential treatment.An out-group consist of anyone who does not belong to the group .
08/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it is
08/08/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
08/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I am
08/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 813 5023: If I may ask 

Let’s say the university I have chose. Is $2800 as you said .This amount is after the scholarship ?
08/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, yes you are absolutely correct, this amount here includes your tuition fee and hostel fee( accommodation and food) per annum.
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright I’m asking if a scholarship will cover some of the amount
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 813 5023: On that 2800 dollars per annum
08/08/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, it is certainly possible as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers 50%-100% scholarships. However, in order to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

Now i hope we are clear here ?
08/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes we are
08/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
08/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Not yet
08/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
08/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright thank you
08/08/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great day.
08/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Thanks and same applies
08/08/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.

19/10/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A- level?

19/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright ma’am
19/10/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it is accurate
19/10/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yeah Ma’am I recall
19/10/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright 
The first stage is the message from the Founders of Edoofa which you shared the videos with me and I shared my understanding 
Then the second stage which is the statement of purpose which I had to fill online which you said is the only statement that will convince the admission that I qualify for the scholarship.Then the Counseling session with the admission after I get the admission.After that the next stage is to get the offer letter from the universities then I will have to choose one university from them.The Registration and Admission starts at stage 5 then last but not least the Application of the visa
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
19/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes…once I get the offer letter from any university how long does it take before I start the registration process
19/10/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778135023 with the discussion we have planned for today, your current query shall be answered soon, so may I know if you are ready to start?
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright is it noted
19/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 813 5023: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 813 5023: That’s my A level result slip
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 813 5023: I’ve done reviewing
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kudzai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 813 5023: That is good to hear
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it does
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it does
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Everything is clear now
19/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 813 5023: No questions yet
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes Ma’am
19/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright good night
07/11/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Kudzai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
07/11/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 07:30 PM.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 07:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

07/11/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

08/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the discussion?
08/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes let’s proceed

2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 813 5023: 1.900US
2.3 years
3.
4.750US
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 813 5023: I did not understand question 3 sorry
08/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your responses, let me help you understand question 3 is the duration of your course, which is 3 years may I know if you are clear now?
08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright I understand
08/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Ma’am sorry I had a problem with my phone
08/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 813 5023: I understand
08/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. I would love to continue with our discussion now however, it is past our available hours, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available.
08/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes Ma’am definitely
08/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have great night and do convey my regards to your family as well.
08/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Thank you have a good nice too
08/11/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
09/11/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Kudzai.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 813 5023: How are you doing
09/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes you can connect with me since my parents are not available at the moment
09/11/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Alright, please let us connect in the meantime. So may I know if you are clear so far?
09/11/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I’m clear
09/11/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
09/11/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/11/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright I understand
09/11/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
09/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes
09/11/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
09/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes move on
09/11/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
09/11/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
09/11/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
09/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes
09/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes please
09/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 721 6269: This message was deleted
09/11/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/11/23, 12:13 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes Ma’am
11/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
11/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudzai.

I hope you are doing well. It was a great time with my family during the festival. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to schedule our conversation for 05:00 pm CAT today. I hope you will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: How are you doing
14/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I am doing great. Kindly excuse me it was our dinner break, however, we can connect now. May I know if you are available to connect now?
14/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes
14/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
14/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I am
14/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
14/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
14/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes that’s where our house is but right now I’m staying in South Africa
14/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
14/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
14/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
14/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright thank you
14/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
14/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 813 5023: No I have the account details already thanks
14/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand however, the account details have been updated. So let me share the details. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
14/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Thank you
14/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
14/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
14/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 813 5023: If I may ask
14/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Am I allowed to choose another university if I’m not comfortable with this one before I make the payments
14/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Like you had promised that there will be different choices of universities
14/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
14/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it’s clear now thanks
14/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778135023 I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if we are still connected?
14/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 813 5023: No I’m not aware
14/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Pardon me my phone had switched off
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, we can connect now and move ahead may I know if you are ready?
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes let’s move ahead
14/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
14/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you were able to note the fee summary above?
14/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I’ve noted
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
14/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes Ma’am
14/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
14/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
14/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
14/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Yes it does
14/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
14/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
14/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 813 5023: I don’t have questions for now
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected? <This message was edited>

21/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Well it’s unfortunate I did not because they were still at burial.It’s only my father that came back from burial because he had to attend work today so he’s still at work and we haven’t discussed anything

I understand that your family has gone through a lot during this week, now that your father is back, may I know when you plan to discuss with him, since if you miss your deadline tomorrow as long as I wish to help you her I will not be able to since the deadlines are issued by the university?
21/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Maybe tomorrow Ma’am
21/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 813 5023: The problem is I can’t reach him all the time especially when he’s at work
21/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 813 5023: When he’s home he’s phone is usually switched off because the only time he uses WhatsApp he will be connected to the Wi-Fi at work
21/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Unless you would want to call him yourself if possible

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778135023 I trust you realize the rarity and value of scholarship opportunities, especially those for studying abroad. Missing such a chance can be significant, and I must express my disappointment that, despite being aware of your scholarship, your parents did not reach out to us. Timely communication could have allowed me to provide the necessary assistance and help in securing your seat. While there is always the option to wait for another opportunity, it's important to seize these moments when they arise.

22/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if your parents will be available to connect with us tomorrow, I am still willing to help if you assure me that your parents will be available?

22/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 813 5023: Waiting for this message
