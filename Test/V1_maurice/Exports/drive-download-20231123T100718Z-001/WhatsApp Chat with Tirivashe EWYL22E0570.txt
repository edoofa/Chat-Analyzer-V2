25/08/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's have our session on *Monday and Thursday* from 12:00-01:30 PM.
25/08/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am very excited for this amazing academic journey to begin. Before we start, I want to wish you all the best, and please have this with you: I am always here to assist you and give you the right direction.
I read this quote somewhere that said, ‘1 step daily means *1 step UP*. 0 step daily means *1 step DOWN*’. I would appreciate it if we make steady progress daily so that I can make it a _learning and earning opportunity_ for you.
25/08/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your session is on *MONDAY* and *THURSDAY* from *12:00-01:30 PM*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on MONDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on THURSDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
25/08/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted thank you ma'am
31/08/23, 12:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're having a wonderful day.

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects on the *EWYL Line*
31/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Likewise ma'am...how are you
02/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
04/09/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am delighted to share some exciting news with you. Tomorrow, we embark on a journey to visit our esteemed universities for the orientation event, a momentous occasion that fills me with great anticipation🫰🏼

As we prepare for this enriching experience, *I want to inform you that our regular sessions for the next two days will not be held* However, fear not; we shall resume our engaging discussions and learning on *_Thursday, the 7th of September, 2023._*
During our visit, I promise to capture moments to share with you through pictures and updates 📷
