04/11/23, 11:30 am - +260 96 7021828: Good morning ms sharda, sorry that I couldn't connect with you yesterday. This was due to the fact that I arrived very late as I stated that I was traveling.

08/11/23, 9:15 am - +260 96 7021828: Good morning ms sharda. I have to mention that I  mwaba:s mother, standing in for her since she is in school, writing her final exams

08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be *Mwaba’S* mentor, guide, and a friend throughout the journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are she is in India. 
Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you got an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with *Mwaba*.
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 7021828: The objectives have been shared, just that I haven't mastered them
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - +260 96 7021828: Good to have you as my daughter's mentor. On behalf of my daughter and indeed on my own behalf we welcome you ms sharda
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Mwaba* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 96 7021828: Thanks for reminding me of the objectives
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Mwaba* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Mwaba* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - +260 96 7021828: Noted
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Mwaba*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Mwaba* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Mwaba* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 96 7021828: I have gone through part of document  and I will finish it later but for now I have to attend to other issues. Can
  we connect tomorrow?
08/11/23, 6:06 pm - +260 96 7021828: May I know your working hours
09/11/23, 8:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: _*Greetings for the day,*_
I hope you are in good health. *This is a gentle reminder that we have a scheduled session at 8:30am*

09/11/23, 11:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: As we come to the end of today's sessions, I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*. You must learn about Diwali, *light a candle on the occasion*, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩
09/11/23, 11:51 am - +260 96 7021828: Greetings , sorry I couldn't connect with you. And thank you for informing me of your non availability on the stated dates
 I will try to create time to connect with you on 14th November
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Rise and shine, *Mwaba*! Just like the sun, you have the power to illuminate the world. 

Confirming your availability for our *today's session at 8:30 am* would be the first bright spot in my day. Let's make today as radiant as the sunrise!
Looking forward to our session.
14/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 96 7021828: Good afternoon, I think we can  chat for now if you have time
14/11/23, 3:08 pm - +260 96 7021828: Let me state that starting the session at 08:30 am is not conducive for me by this is busy hours with work. Unless from 12;00pm
14/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If this is your concern then shifting our session from 1:30pm will be better. Kindly confirm your availability for the scheduled time.

15/11/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Mwaba*
