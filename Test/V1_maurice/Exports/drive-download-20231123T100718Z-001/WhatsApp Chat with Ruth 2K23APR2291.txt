06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ruth,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Ruth's higher education?

10/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Ruth.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few weeks, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263719749119 @263775987016 @263785661672 ?
11/10/23, 5:33 am - +263 78 566 1672: Morning Ma'am. We are all well thank you. Please note that Ruth is starting her final exams this coming week and she has been under a lot of pressure. Am also engaged in my first half semester exams so can we do this later.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. Good morning! Thank you for the update. It's completely understandable that you both have academic commitments. Focus on your exams. However, please understand that we want you to connect because the 2024 admissions are now open only through Edoofa, and I do not want Ruth to miss this opportunity in such a case, what we can do is connect on Saturdays for 2 hours, where the work and study pressure is also less and you will be able to take out 2 hours easily. Does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
11/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and I would love to answer your concern here however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Please accept my apologies for the delay in connecting as I had a busy schedule at work. I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
20/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ruth,
