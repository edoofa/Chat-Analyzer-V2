15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 867 1027: For my counseling session with Ms Tushti everything was  laid down for me the question and the answers, everything was just interesting because she explained a lot to me about Edoofa and also explained to me on how to make the payments. It was interesting because I understood everything from my counselor
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 867 1027: She also gave me the advice pertaining the course that I chose
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That sounds like a comprehensive and helpful session. I'm glad that Ms. Tushti was able to provide such detailed information about Edoofa and assist you in understanding the payment process and the course you've chosen. It's crucial to have a clear understanding of these aspects as they significantly impact your educational journey.
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm ready
15/11/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

*1. Feedback Form:* Your candid feedback is invaluable in our pursuit of excellence. This form offers you the chance to voice your opinions and suggestions.

Once completed, you can scan the document or click a picture and share it with us here in your admission group.

15/11/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour grows late on my end, I'm afraid I have limited time available today. Therefore, I regretfully must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow starting from 1:00 PM onwards to continue our discussion. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
16/11/23, 7:36 am - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:44 am - +263 78 867 1027: Okok sir
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Rumbidzai and Esteemed Family,
I hope this message finds you well today. 

I trust that the intervening period has been productive and filled with positivity on your end.

As we resume our conversation from yesterday, I am eager to guide you through the next steps in your admission journey. Before we proceed, if I may ask are you ready for today's session? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Good afternoon Mr Milan how are you doing today
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm ready for the session
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I have gone through the form that you have filled and shared here with me, and I can see that you have not attached your picture there as well as you have written NO in your answer to question number 6.A, can you please let me know of the reason behind that dear?
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ms Tushti did mention to me about the money to be paid including the accommodation, food and tuition fee but it was written on the Acceptance letter so I'm not sure of the amount of money to be paid
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 867 1027: So my question is, the amount of money to be paid after receiving a scholarship percentage will range from 2000-3000 including tuition fee, food and accommodation?
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for highlighting that, Rumbidzai. Your concern about the mentioned amount in the acceptance letter is valid. Allow me to clarify the financial aspect of the Edoofa scholarship program.
16/11/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: The scholarship you've been awarded is a scholarship that covers a specific percentage of your tuition fee i.e. from 50-100%. Additionally, the mentioned amount in the acceptance letter includes an estimated calculation for accommodation and food expenses. 

Upon receiving the scholarship percentage, the remaining amount you're responsible for will indeed range approximately between 2000 to 3000, covering expenses related to accommodation, food, and remaining tuition fee after the scholarship deduction. This estimation provides a rough idea; the exact amount can be discussed and finalized once you've received your scholarship offer and decided on the university. I hope this is understood now?
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes this is clear thank you sir
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, I would like you to correct your feedback form and then share it with me here again. Till then, shall we move ahead?
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Sir when I wrote my A level examination ZIMSEC we started in November 2020 and finished January 2021 so which is the year that I'm supposed to fill in the counseling feedback form
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We did not manage to finish the exams in 2020 due to Corona virus so should I use 2020 or 2021
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, you can fill in 2021 please.
16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the time draws closer to evening on my end, I regret to inform you that I have limited availability remaining for today. Hence, I must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's aim to reconnect tomorrow, starting from 1:00 PM onwards, to continue our discussion. I hope this arrangement suits your schedule. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening ahead. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per our previous conversation, I am reaching out to continue our discussion regarding your university admission journey. I trust that you've had a productive day so far.

Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes let's start
20/11/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I'm done we can proceed
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please let's proceed to the next steps
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes  I understand that
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Well explained
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I don't have any queries
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I will kindly try to work extra hard as ordered  to receive AAL
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes we can no problem
20/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We can proceed with our discussion
20/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
