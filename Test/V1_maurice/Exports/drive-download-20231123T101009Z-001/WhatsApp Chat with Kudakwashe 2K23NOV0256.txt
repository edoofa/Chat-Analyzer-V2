Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 267 7923: All the best ..on  ur new appointment..and thank u for all u have done  for us..we are grateful
22/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!.

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said our team has dedicated considerable time to refine and enhance your upcoming educational journey for 2025. We've honed in on an improved approach and I'm excited to share these insights with you. Let's delve into the details together tomorrow at 6:00 PM. In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
