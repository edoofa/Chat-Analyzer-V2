07/08/23, 11:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 461 6259: I am doing well. Thank you for the update and feedback
22/08/23, 8:02 am - +263 77 461 6259: Good morning Ms Ananya. I am ready to resume with the EWYL program
23/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Esnay!

That's amazing!
23/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
23/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 461 6259: Morning and how are you
23/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am great! How about you?
23/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 461 6259: I am okay
23/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 461 6259: I have read the document and my understanding so far is that EWYL has improvised the use of online projects for they are not easily interacted by pandemics happening in the world.
For my first project I understood that I have to connect with various companies in my country on the internet using LinkedIn. The company has to have about 25-30 employees. Once l have connected with them, I share the Edoofa message then l arrange for a call or vedio call meeting with them connecting with my manager then they sign a contract. That is what I understood so far
23/08/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good work Esnay!🌟
23/08/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/08/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 461 6259: I have finished listening to the audio
23/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/08/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 461 6259: I have heard that for me to get started, I must create a LinkedIn account then connect with digital companies in my country, tell them of my objective with the Edoofa. When I have connected with them I take down their contact numbers so that l arrange a meeting with the Edoofa people so that they can shed more light on the program
23/08/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks . I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
23/08/23, 9:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 461 6259: I have understood that my task is to look for potential companies that can work with Edoofa. The factors to consider are nature of the company, scale of the company, financial stability of the company and background of the founder.
The platforms that l can use for my research are Google, LinkedIn among others.
Steps to consider are searching, studying a little bit about the companies searched, check if the company is working properly, check the various social media pages of the company, study the background of the founder and the core members of the company and lastly start searching for them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request
23/08/23, 9:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Esnay, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
23/08/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 461 6259: Thank you

25/08/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 461 6259: Good morning Ms Ananya
25/08/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, my proud edoofian!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?🚀
25/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 461 6259: I am doing well. Yes I am ready
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

25/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 461 6259: Do l have to form a community group first before spreading the offline application forms or l can just send the application form
25/08/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can just send the application forms, this method is for your ease only.
25/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay I understand now
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:

29/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
29/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Esnay we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
29/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 461 6259: +263772287911. My head master's contact number
29/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
29/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
29/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
29/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 461 6259: So how will we go about it
29/08/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
29/08/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
29/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
29/08/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now,  we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
29/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay. So my highlight was the community build-up project which all the students are given equal opportunity to higher education. My only concern on this one is that most of the students will fail on the stage where money is concerned because l come from an underdeveloped community
30/08/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 461 6259: Good morning Ms Ananya . I am ready for my session.
31/08/23, 8:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, you know we could not connect yesterday because it was the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate their special bond. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐
31/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay. Good to hear that. Good morning
31/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

31/08/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 461 6259: Yes l am ready
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you were able to connect with your school head?
31/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 461 6259: I couldn't because you were not available
31/08/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I shared the message with you, were you able to send this to your school head?

31/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
31/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
31/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
31/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
31/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 461 6259: Yes
31/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
31/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay noted
31/08/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
31/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
31/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, Esnay since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

09/11/23, 11:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, 

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity.

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
