27/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah true l understand Sir
27/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 5:00 PM.
27/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

27/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Rights and duties are two interconnected concepts that govern the relationship between individuals and society. 

Rights refer to the entitlements or privileges that individuals possess, which are typically protected by laws or social conventions. They are considered fundamental to the well-being and dignity of individuals. Rights can include civil rights, human rights, legal rights, and more. Examples of rights include the right to life, liberty, equality, freedom of speech, and privacy.

Duties, on the other hand, are the obligations or responsibilities that individuals have towards others or society as a whole. Duties are typically established by laws, ethical principles, or social norms. They are meant to promote the welfare and harmony of society. Duties can include responsibilities such as obeying laws, paying taxes, respecting the rights of others, and participating in civic activities.

Now, let's discuss the difference between human rights and civil rights:
27/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Human rights are inherent to all individuals by virtue of their humanity. They are universal, inalienable, and indivisible. Human rights are often considered to be fundamental rights that every person is entitled to, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, or any other characteristic. Examples of human rights include the right to life, liberty, equality, freedom of expression, and the right to a fair trial. Human rights are typically protected by international treaties and conventions.

Civil rights, on the other hand, are specific rights that are granted to individuals by the government or the state. Civil rights are typically associated with a particular country's legal system and are often outlined in its constitution or laws. These rights are aimed at ensuring equal treatment and protection under the law for all citizens. Examples of civil rights include the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion.
27/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 429 2822: In summary, while human rights are universal and inherent to all individuals, civil rights are specific rights granted by a particular government or state to its citizens. Both rights and duties play a crucial role in maintaining a just and harmonious society.
27/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Answers for question 2
27/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant please follow with the rest.
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 429 2822: A prosecutor and an attorney are both legal professionals, but they have different roles and responsibilities within the legal system.

A prosecutor, also known as a prosecuting attorney or a district attorney, is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their primary role is to initiate and handle criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state or federal government. Prosecutors work to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and present the case against the accused in court. Their objective is to prove the guilt of the defendant and seek a conviction. Prosecutors have the authority to decide whether to bring charges against a person, negotiate plea deals, and advocate for the state's position during trial.
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 429 2822: On the other hand, an attorney, also known as a lawyer or a counsel, is a legal professional who provides legal advice and representation to individuals or organizations. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, corporate law, family law, and more. They can work as advocates for their clients, representing them in legal proceedings, negotiating settlements, drafting legal documents, and providing legal advice. Attorneys can work on behalf of both plaintiffs (the party initiating a legal action) and defendants (the party defending against a legal action).

In summary, a prosecutor is a type of attorney who represents the government in criminal cases, while an attorney is a broader term that encompasses legal professionals who provide legal advice and representation to individuals or organizations in various legal matters.
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 429 2822: The answers for question 3
27/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Studying civil law is important for several reasons:

1. Understanding Legal Rights and Obligations: Civil law governs the relationships and interactions between individuals, organizations, and the state. By studying civil law, individuals can gain a comprehensive understanding of their legal rights and obligations in various areas such as contracts, property, torts, family law, and more. This knowledge helps individuals make informed decisions, protect their interests, and navigate legal issues effectively.

2. Resolving Disputes: Civil law provides the framework for resolving disputes between parties. By studying civil law, individuals can learn about the legal procedures, rights, and remedies available to them in case of a dispute. This knowledge is crucial for effectively advocating for one's rights, negotiating settlements, or seeking legal recourse through the court system.
27/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 429 2822: 3. Legal Compliance: Civil law sets out the rules and regulations that individuals and organizations must follow. By studying civil law, individuals can understand the legal requirements and obligations imposed on them in various aspects of life, such as business operations, contracts, property transactions, employment relationships, and more. This knowledge helps individuals and organizations ensure legal compliance, avoid potential legal pitfalls, and mitigate legal risks.

4. Professional Opportunities: Studying civil law can open up a wide range of professional opportunities in the legal field. It can lead to a career as a lawyer, legal advisor, legal consultant, legal researcher, or other related roles. Knowledge of civil law is also valuable in fields such as business, finance, real estate, human resources, and public administration, where an understanding of legal principles and regulations is essential.
27/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 429 2822: 5. Enhancing Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills: Studying civil law involves analyzing legal principles, statutes, case law, and applying them to real-world scenarios. This process enhances critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. These skills are transferable and can be valuable in various professional and personal contexts.

In summary, studying civil law is important as it provides individuals with a comprehensive understanding of their legal rights and obligations, helps in resolving disputes, ensures legal compliance, opens up professional opportunities, and enhances critical thinking and analytical skills.
27/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Answer for question 4
27/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Last question 5 . The skill that I have that will enable me to become a lawyer is the ability to critically think and analyse situation more will be exposed below
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 429 2822: I had to conduct extensive research on the topic of drug abuse using a variety of sources including books, journals, and online databases. I evaluated the credibility of each source and selected the most relevant and reliable ones to use in my paper. This required a high level of critical thinking and the ability to synthesize a large amount of information into a cohesive argument

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.* <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 5:45 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Sorry to jump in,I just want to ask about the cost of a student visa at the present moment as it can rise next year or not.
30/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah finished reading you can you can proceed
30/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries yes it will be required to be raised next year and the cost of the VISA is $83.
30/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky sir so can we proceed with this session
30/10/23, 8:41 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Yes
30/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky sir nice to hear
30/10/23, 8:57 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Noted
30/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Noted sir
30/10/23, 9:06 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Noted,
30/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah noted
30/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Noted
30/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Please provide me more information
30/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
30/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky now I get it
30/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah true
30/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah l am clear about this solution
30/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yes I am Clear
30/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 963 3845: No l dont have queries
30/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
30/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yes sir l am now looking forward for the offer letter
30/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Tawanda's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
30/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky noted
30/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
30/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky l will send you clear results pictures by tomorrow

31/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to have an update on the O-level certificate. May I know by when you might be able to collect it?
31/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 963 3845: For now l may go to collect the certificate after finishing my Exams because my former school is too far from where I live its about 340 km away so it will be a bit challenge of traveling these days because of exams l am writing at the present moment
31/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the challenges. In that case, may I know if there is anyone at the school who could help you with a picture of the certificate?
31/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 963 3845: For that sir l would to communicate with my former boarding master or any students at school

18/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 963 3845: I think Mr Zhou said he will be able to pay the remaining balance on the first of December
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am happy to hear that. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 963 3845: I am ready sir how are you doing
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Hie sir Shivjeet l am ready for the session
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are doing well and I am doing great too, thank you for asking. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250

20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Let's continue
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Yah it is clear sir
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Oky sir  it is clear
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you? <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Oky sir it's now clear
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival in India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah l am clear about that sir
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Yah explain
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Yah l get it sir
20/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Hello greetings to you sorry for jumping in,does this mean the 425 is needed this month because I still have to pay the outstandanding 150 plus 12percent on the second of November
20/11/23, 3:06 pm - +27 65 128 7894: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I would like to let you know that the amount due was for the enrollment for the Edoofa program. The amount discussed here is the university's registration fees that you will be required to pay for Tawanda's higher education. It also entails a higher amount of scholarship as compared to your peers, which is 90% offered to Tawanda. If you are facing any challenges, could you please relate them to me?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 10:21 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Good evening ,the type of my job causes me sometimes not to attend .I start 4am mostly.i understand the 90 percent and I will fight to pay but I'm asking for the adjustment of payment period for example this month I will pay for the enrolment balance
20/11/23, 10:25 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Then set the fist payment of 425 on end of December the balance end of January .My pay day will be on 7th of each month that will make me pay 7 January and 7 february
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. Thank you for sharing me with the challenges I am ready to help you with them. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Yah l am ready
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I understand the challenges you are facing, and I've taken note of them seriously. I'll address them after our discussion. Shall we proceed with the session now?
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky sir
21/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Yah true
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 963 3845: Oky sir
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Oky sir
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you have received the details.
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 429 2822: Yah l sir l have the details
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you?
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 429 2822: No just share

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - +27 65 128 7894: Yes
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - +27 65 128 7894: How are you this afternoon
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, how are you doing today Mr. Zhou?

21/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's quite the contrast! The weather sounds lovely there. I hope you're staying cool amidst the summer heat. Now coming to the concern May I know if you have made any plans to tacke this challenge?
21/11/23, 6:13 pm - +27 65 128 7894: This what I want to ask on the weather ,do you face snow conditions there .We really want to prepare for the boy
21/11/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We don't experience harsh conditions here during winter at the universities since they are situated in mainland areas away from high-rise or extremely cold locations. This is done to provide students with the most comfortable weather for their studies.
21/11/23, 6:17 pm - +27 65 128 7894: That's fine
21/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.

21/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that hat won't be possible as the university has secured this seat specifically for you and by that time it will be revoked and you will end up on losing out on the offer letter.  Hence in order to help you on this may I know how much will you be able to gather before the first deadline so that I can have a discussion with the Academic board in order to retain this letter. As you can see you have saved a drastic amount of money and hence reduced you finances on this letter with a scholarship of 90% and I don't want you to lose out on this.
21/11/23, 8:49 pm - +27 65 128 7894: That is where I'm stuck because my situation is I'm living out of a salary which I will get on the seventh of December.Im in a situation whereby no one will assists except working as a parent to pay these bills.

22/11/23, 9:31 am - +27 65 128 7894: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
22/11/23, 9:35 am - +27 65 128 7894: <Media omitted>
