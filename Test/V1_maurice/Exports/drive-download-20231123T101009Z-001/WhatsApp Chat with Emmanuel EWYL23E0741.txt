15/11/23, 10:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Emmanuel!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I'm thrilled to witness your enthusiasm for the EWYL project, and I'm equally excited to embark on this amazing journey with you.

However, please excuse the slight delay in the process. I've been occupied with the orientation at our partner university, and we recently had a small Diwali break, which made it a bit challenging to connect with my students for a short period.
15/11/23, 10:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, to give you a glimpse of the festivities and orientation, I've attached a few photos. It was a joyous celebration, and the orientation went well too. I thought you might enjoy seeing how Diwali is celebrated here in India and the positive energy from our orientation sessions.

17/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - +260 96 7415696: My name is Emmanuel chana am 18 years old, am the first born in a family of five with two brothers as my siblings. I completed my grade 12 in the year 2022.
17/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Emmanuel, kindly excuse me for not being able to continue our discussion, as I was engaged in an important conversation with the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana. We discussed how we can help our students acquire quality skills that will make them job-ready.

I am confident that we will generate some brilliant ideas. In the meantime, I would like you to share some unique skills you wish to learn before coming to India! We shall discuss this in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays."
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks so much I will be waiting, have good day!

20/11/23, 10:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Emmanuel, it's great to learn more about you. However, since I can't wait to begin our journey, let's connect today at 1:30 p.m. to compensate for our previous session.
20/11/23, 10:17 am - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks will be there
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - +260 96 7415696: *Dear Mentor, my name is Emmanuel Chana, and my EWYL group name is Emmanuel EWYL23E0741. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 21/11/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emmanuel! 🌞

Here's a little inspiration to start our day: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue those counts.' - Winston Churchill. Now, let us begin our session with enthusiasm and a quest for knowledge. 📚✨
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +260 96 7415696: Good afternoon
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - +260 96 7415696: Not quite, if you can  elaborate more on that
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 7415696: I understand
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - +260 96 7415696: Yes
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As our virtual session draws to a close, remember that knowledge is a journey, not a destination. Let the ideas percolate, and may your curiosity continue to spark new adventures. Until our digital paths cross again, keep the learning flame alive. Stay inspired, stay curious, and embrace the wonders that each moment brings. Until next time, champions of wisdom! 🚀
20/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 7415696: Surely Knowledge is  a journey
21/11/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning! 🚀

I am very disappointed by your unresponsiveness during the session.  I'm sure you're aware that the session duration is one hour. I would recommend you to be responsive during the session. By the time you reply to my texts, the session has already concluded.
