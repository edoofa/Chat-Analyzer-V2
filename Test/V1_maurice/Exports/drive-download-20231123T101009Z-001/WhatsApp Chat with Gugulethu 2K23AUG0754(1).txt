I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?

Thank you for sharing the forms with me. However, I have noticed that you have not yet pasted your passport photo on the front page in the designated space. May I know if you are facing any challenges with that?
12/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 278 8359: Iam at school thus i have no access to the picture
12/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know if you have any recent photos in your drive that you might be able to share with me?
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 278 8359: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that you mentioned the date in the EWYL form as november. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which are scheduled to begin on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.

However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled, that parents can actively participate in.
12/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. hence, if Abdul is occupied with school, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program
13/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was hoping for a response from your end regarding our conversation about the admission process so that we can complete our discussion in due time. However, I did not receive a response from your end. Please let me know if you have received my message so that we can proceed and complete our session for the admission process.
14/10/23, 7:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Gugulethu

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I am happy to let you know that I am available today a little bit early as it is the weekend and very much ready to take on our session with full productivity. Please let me know so that we can continue our session and wrap it up early.
18/10/23, 9:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gugulethu,

Over the past couple of weeks, we at Edoofa have been waiting for you to connect with the admissions team and move forward with your university admission journey. However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to get a response from your end.

We do understand that you might have your reasons because of which you were not able to connect or share an update regarding the challenges. However, your absence has left a negative impression on your scholarship application file, which could result in missing out on your scholarship opportunity.
18/10/23, 9:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, the academic board urged us to reach out to you once again and give you an opportunity to transparently share the concerns you have because of which you have not been connecting with the team, so that the relevant solutions can be shared with you.
18/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 556 6776: Hello everyone
My network has been a problem for the past 3 weeks..I am now available apologies for any inconveniences caused
18/10/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for reaching out and explaining the situation. We completely understand that network issues can be quite challenging. We appreciate your effort in informing us. To ensure a smooth continuation of your admission process and scholarship application, could you please let us know if your network issues have been resolved?
18/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 556 6776: Noted 
It will be difficult for us since we are in remote rural areas.Maybe if we were notified on start that you want people who are always on network .Gugulethu is at school where phones are only allowed to be used on given times and her being found in possession of the gadget  during other times may lead to her being expelled from school.Me as the mother I work in remote rural areas where network is on certain spots and during week days I am on duty from 0715hours to 1600hrs..unless or otherwise I can go to the network point from 1pm to2pm thus lunch time thus when network is there..
18/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 556 6776: Yes 
But take note that I am on spot network
18/10/23, 1:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your circumstances with us. We deeply understand the challenges posed by limited network availability in remote areas and the restrictions in the school regarding phone usage. We sincerely appreciate your dedication and effort in ensuring Gugulethu's education and scholarship application.

Given the constraints you've mentioned, we'll work together to find a suitable solution. So, I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes lam

18/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes
18/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 71 556 6776: I am ready
18/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Done
18/10/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/10/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes they are clear
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Following
18/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 556 6776: All clear
18/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes we can
18/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes you can share

18/10/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

21/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 556 6776: .Edoofians are encouraged to be able to follow instructions,open and teachable so as to achieve their goals.As much as it might seem too long for courses taking up to 5 years but after completion some are seen smiling cause of results.Edoofa's doesn't just assist with accessibility of quality education but wants learners to be more successful and recognisable in the society in future.Also removing the dependency syndrome making them more independent and be a helping hand in changing the society in future.Edoofians have to be open minded and teachable to allow a smooth flow of learning.Edoofa chooses schools that have a reputable success and results not schools that when learners are enrolled there end up asking for something in return.Following instructions is vital in Edoofa as it makes Edoofians to be more focused and no their real and main aim to study in India and put in mind how they are really assisted.
With the story of a lady coned USD 1000 to study in China and how Edoofa process take part got no doubt I really trust Edoofa
23/10/23, 6:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Gugulethu!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time. I have gone through your message, and I appreciate that you have shared your understanding with me.
23/10/23, 6:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.

23/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Gugulethu!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noon 
My weekend was good hope yours was good also
23/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: yes indeed it was.
23/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
23/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
23/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes we are
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

30/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes did join but haven't yet received any details
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to share the above mentioned message here which is


*Dear Mentor, my name is Gugulethu Mabuza Ncube, and my EWYL group name is Gugulethu EWYL23E0566. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 27/10/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
30/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Sorry Gugulethu is offline
30/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that in that case may I know if you were able to introduce to the group as Gugulethu's Mother.
30/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Sorry you mean the group I joined..or this one
30/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confusion. I was referring to the new EWYL group that I have provided to you.
30/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further and hopefully complete our session for the day? @263715566776
30/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Evening sorry for network disconnection it was raining
30/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. As much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
31/10/23, 6:01 am - +263 71 556 6776: Morning everyone..Noted with thanks
31/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
31/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
31/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
31/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood
31/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
31/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
31/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Hie maybe I'm lost that other money we paid in August was for what
31/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you here. That was the enrollment for the EDOOFA program, where you have the opportunity to receive multiple offer letters. And for the EWYL  program, where Gugulethu will be able to earn credits that will be used for reducing the tuition fees.
31/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted .Though it wasn't well said .When is the 750 due
31/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be due after you have received the offer letters from the universities, and you will be provided with an ample amount of time for the deadline so that you can prepare the finances in advance. May I know if you are on the same page here as well?
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 556 6776: We can proceed
31/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
31/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
31/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
31/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Thank you yes we had a blessed one
06/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
06/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
06/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
06/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes ready
06/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

06/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Reviewed n understood
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted thanks
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Goodday... Sorry wasn't available .. During working days I'm available from 4pm
08/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know if you are available now to proceed with the session?
08/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes I am
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan - <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted and understood
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
08/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
08/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
08/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Following
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 556 6776: May I be provided with more information
08/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for the day now. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 10th to the 13th of November and wi be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the *"Festival of Lights."* It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

09/11/23, 7:16 am - +263 71 556 6776: Morning..noted Happy Diwali to you ,your families and all Indians... enjoy
14/11/23, 1:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Gugulethu!

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Today holds particular significance for us here in India as we celebrate Children's Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14th. This day is dedicated to acknowledging and advocating for the well-being and rights of children, fostering an environment that supports their growth and development through various events and activities. Wishing you a joyful Children's Day, I am eager to embark on today's session. With that said, I am ready to take on today's session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 1:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Afternoon ..My lunch hour is almost over I will be ready to proceed from 16:30pm thus after dismissal
14/11/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate your time management, and I'll be ready to proceed with our session at 16:30 pm your time. If there are any specific topics or questions you'd like to address during our session, please feel free to let me know in advance.
14/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Now ready to proceed
14/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
14/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes
14/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood
14/11/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes I do
14/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Clear
14/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted
14/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Very clear
14/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood ...
14/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Gugulethu's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Gugulethu is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
