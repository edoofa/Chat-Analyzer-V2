I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you very much sir_*

22/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you very much.We are waiting for the inspiring video._*

22/09/23, 1:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 797 7023: May you please elaborate on the *two key objectives* l have gone through the video thrice ,I really got inspired.

22/09/23, 1:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, thank you so much.
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Rejoice is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you for explanation; everything is now cristal clear.I took note of the two key objectives._*
22/09/23, 1:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great⚡
22/09/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much
22/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 797 7023: I have known the EWLY team.Thank you very much.
22/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
26/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Greetings
26/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Noted with thanks
26/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Rejoice will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
26/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much.We are going through the document
26/09/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Rejoice can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much.
26/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Thank you very much
26/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 797 7023: We have gone through the document
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, great!
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
26/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Currently Rejoice Machekano is at a boarding school Will be writing her A' level final examinations.She will complete her examination on 30th of November 2023._*

I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
