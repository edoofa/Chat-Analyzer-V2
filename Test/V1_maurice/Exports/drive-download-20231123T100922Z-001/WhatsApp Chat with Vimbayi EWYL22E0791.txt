You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details.

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

05/10/23, 10:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Vimbayi

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them now!

11/10/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Vimbayi! Wonderful!🏆
11/10/23, 3:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience through the video really helped. That's why I would also like you to create a video for your community.
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - +91 79860 21640: Okay ma'am noted
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Talking about the video, you can include the following points:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
