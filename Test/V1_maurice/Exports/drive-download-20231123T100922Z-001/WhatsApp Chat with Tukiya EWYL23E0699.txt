07/10/23, 12:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tukiya! 

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
07/10/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 7440395: I am ready and so excited
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/10/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 7440395: So today my parents have visited at my boarding school where I don't have access to technology. Therefore I am only available today for a few minutes
08/10/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7440395: I'll be fully available in December when schools close
09/10/23, 8:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tukiya!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
09/10/23, 8:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm*

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
09/10/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 7440395: Good morning... Thank you for the consideration. This is Tukiya's Mum, I will represent her and take the option of 2 to 3 pm. Thank you
09/10/23, 12:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @260977440395 

How are you today? Thank you for your response. Shall we connect today at 2:00PM?
09/10/23, 12:46 pm - +260 97 7440395: Yes, we can connect at 2pm today
09/10/23, 12:47 pm - +260 97 7440395: I am well.. I hope you are too
09/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: @260977440395 
 Shall we move forward with our discussion?
09/10/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7440395: Yes
09/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
09/10/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7440395: Please enlighten me but I would assume part of the objective is to give practical experience
09/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tukiya* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
09/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7440395: Well understood
09/10/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7440395: Is the program identical for all students or it's unique to different careers
09/10/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 7440395: Will the 'job' for Tukiya be related to chemical engineering?
09/10/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL projects are designed to ensure the overall development of a student, providing her with skills that will be valuable in any field she chooses to pursue.
09/10/23, 2:38 pm - +260 97 7440395: Alright
09/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
09/10/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7440395: I have read
09/10/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
09/10/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 7440395: Nice to meet you both
09/10/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
09/10/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 7440395: Yes, very interesting but also a little scary 😁
09/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, that is a very unusual response that I have received so far. However, I would like to understand the scary part so that I can assist you with it.
09/10/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 7440395: Scary/intimidating. It's going to be a first of its kind for Tukiya. The fear is how to adapt and excel... But I am sure you will be there to guide.. Correct
09/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns, and it's natural to find something new and different a bit intimidating at first. However, I want to assure you that I'll be here to provide guidance and support every step of the way. Together, we'll help Tukiya adapt and excel in this new experience.
09/10/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977440395 

How are you today? Shall we move forward with our discussion?
10/10/23, 2:23 pm - +260 97 7440395: Good Afternoon.. Thanks. Sorry I'm late
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7440395: We can proceed with our discussion
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you were able to read the newsletter?
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - +260 97 7440395: I was, yes
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - +260 97 7440395: Very encouraging
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tukiya* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - +260 97 7440395: I have carefully read the document. This will be an enriching project for Tukiya. Great exposure to real life skills
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Tukiya* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Tukiya* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
10/10/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 7440395: Understood
12/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @260977440395 

Shall we move forward with our discussion?
12/10/23, 1:38 pm - +260 97 7440395: Good Afternoon..

Yes please
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 1:41 pm - +260 97 7440395: I was of the view you would wait for Tukiya to come and do the projects herself?
12/10/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 7440395: We agreed to the 3 day initial sessions 👆🏾
12/10/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! Tukiya can connect with me after her exams. Meanwhile, we can put her sessions on hold.
12/10/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In order to do that,  as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my exams.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
12/10/23, 1:50 pm - +260 97 7440395: Thank you
12/10/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 7440395: Email has been sent as advised
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time, @260977440395
19/10/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D

19/10/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 7440395: Thank you 🙏🏾
20/10/23, 12:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What key points or insights did you gather from the video I shared? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts so that I can share more of these in the future
20/10/23, 4:21 pm - +260 97 7440395: Greetings... Tukiya is not allowed to have her phone at school so she will only see the video when we visit
21/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Tukiya!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my student's exams are over now, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step toward their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted when would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
21/11/23, 3:44 pm - +260 97 7440395: Greetings. Indeed Tukiya is done with her exams but she will remain in school until the 25th when they celebrate thier graduation ceremony. Therefore Tukiya will be online on the 27th.
Kind Regards
22/11/23, 7:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing me.
