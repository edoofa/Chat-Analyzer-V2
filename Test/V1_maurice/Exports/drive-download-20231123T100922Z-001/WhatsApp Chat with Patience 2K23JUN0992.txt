07/09/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Patience,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Patience's higher education?

16/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/10/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:00 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening. In the meantime, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).

2. O-Level Results

17/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Patience,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Hello so sorry I thought that I had communicated that my daughter is writing her examinations now
17/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 226 5234: She is only eligible for university next year
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am aware of that @263772265234. And since the 2024 intake admissions have started only through Edoofa, hence we wanted to connect with you, this group wants parents' equal involvement so if the student is not available parents can always have the discussions on their behalf, please.
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Okay I see
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, so could you please let me know by when will you be able to share the required documents with us?
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Let me send them tomorrow
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since parents are able to share the documents within the same day?
17/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings I have been anticipating your response since the afternoon, may I please know if we are still connected with each other @263772265234?
17/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 226 5234: The documents that you were requesting where at home and I was at work
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know by when will you be able to share the documents with us?

17/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am aware of that, and that is why you can share the statement of entry for A- level because most of the students have them from now.
17/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, however, since we connected after a long time due to some technical issues the conversation is unable to open.
17/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes my daughter is in boarding school so I can only get to see her when she finishes writing her examinations
17/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 226 5234: I will try to ask the school to send me
17/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, I would suggest you connect with Patience's teacher and ask them to share the statement of entry with you and you can share the same with us. May I know if this plan sounds acceptable?
18/10/23, 11:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay.

21/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 226 5234: Initial stage is to get a message from the founders of Edoofa where we where shown videos of some Edoofa students who are already in India, I know Edoofa is legitimate because after my daughter got the place I did the same for my cousin daughters who is doing masters she is already in India as we speak.
21/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 226 5234: Secondly my daughter had to write a statement of purpose
21/10/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 226 5234: We did counseling sessions on university admissions and everything went well, she then got a letter of admission into Perul university but we told them to reserve the place for next year and other University I forgot the name
21/10/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 226 5234: So we can only then proceed when she gets her results next year
21/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.

01/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days and delays are affecting Patience's scholarship application, please I would encourage you to be transparent with us, and let us know if there are some kind of challenges that you are facing? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Good afternoon I am very sorry you feel that way
01/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Unfortunately the nature of my job as a pharmacist sometimes I am very busy, and sometimes the responses are slow when they come I will be very busy
01/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Everything is very clear I have even my cousin daughter who is now in India doing her master's she did everything after patience, so we have a clear understanding of the processes
01/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 226 5234: I now feel like we are repeating what we did already
01/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's completely acceptable that your job as a pharmacist can be demanding, and I appreciate your efforts to communicate when possible.

I'm glad to hear that you have a clear understanding of the processes. However, there is an opportunity for you which I would like to share however, if you are not available then it will not be possible for me to communicate and this opportunity can even ease your financial burden.
01/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Please explain the opportunity
01/11/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/11/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/11/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Thank you so much
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Please proceed
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Patience, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you for a while now but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes available
02/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
02/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Please add 00263716424108 Mr Nyamutora
02/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes very clear
02/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add Mr. Nyamutora to the group.
02/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 1:37 pm - ~ Mai Violet added +263 71 642 4108
02/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes agreed
02/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Understood
02/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 226 5234: No it's very clear
02/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Please explain I was thinking that we would wait for the results in February 2024
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
02/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes now it's clear
02/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
02/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 226 5234: Yes I understood that they can persue a diploma or do a bridge yr
02/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/11/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:30 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As our available hours for Saturday are over we will be connecting with you on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
04/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Hello, Patience is busy with her exams right now but will be finishing soon, i think around the 23rd of November 2023 and after that she will be available full time to give you all the other information you might need. Thank you
04/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, the 23rd is a long time, and this is affecting her scholarship hence I will recommend you to attend the discussions on her behalf please.
04/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Ok noted
04/11/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please since our available working hours for Saturday are over we will connect on Monday.
04/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 642 4108: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏾
06/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I trust you're all in good health. Following up on our previous discussion, may I inquire if now is a convenient time for us to have connect and have a discussion?
06/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Hello
06/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Still at work but we can discuss
06/11/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I really appreciate you connecting with us despite your being at work. 

Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Understood
06/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes it's clear, she is writing her A levels at the moment and we expect her to attain good grades at least more than 12 points so i don't see her doing a diploma program, definitely she will be going to University next year
06/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 642 4108: She is very brilliant and one of the best students at her school which is one of the best schools in Zimbabwe in terms of good passes
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about her dedication and anticipated success in her A levels. With the expectation of scoring more than 12 points, she's clearly set for university studies next year. It must be a proud moment for you, especially with her being among the top students at one of Zimbabwe's most esteemed schools for academic excellence I am sure she will make you really proud. 

However, it is our responsibility to share the additional benefits as well.
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Ok Noted
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 642 4108: No queries and it's all clear
06/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Patience's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Patience is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
06/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes very excited
06/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 642 4108: We are ready
06/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Thanks a lot, good night.
17/11/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

17/11/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 6:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Patience!

18/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 226 5234: The letter is very clear and straight forward thanks once again

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes, good afternoon
20/11/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to reconnect with you here again. How was your weekend?
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 642 4108: The weekend was fine
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Howz India over there
20/11/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. India is good as well, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, may I know if you have a proper understanding till here so that we can move ahead with our conversation as well?
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 642 4108: So far so good, everything seems to be clear
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Fee per semester is 1800usd b4 scholarship after 50% scholarship it's 900usd
20/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Standard duration of course is 3 years
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Procedure fee one time payable is 300usd
20/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Registration fee is 750usd
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Good afternoon, it's ok, i am at the farm today, the network here is very poor, but we can try
21/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Moving ahead, the information that you had shared is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
21/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes true, it's clear
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
22/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience!
I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter here. May I know by when can we connect with each other here again for the same?
22/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 642 4108: Let's reconnect, i am at the farm so the network is not very good
22/11/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. On that note, may I know if we can move ahead with our conversation here?
22/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 642 4108: Yes please
22/11/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Before we do that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
22/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 642 4108: All clear so far
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes i am sure when Patience gets there she will be able to make her own choice on what type of accommodation she would prefer
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed that is completely true!  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
22/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes true, all clear
22/11/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
22/11/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
22/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Ok Noted
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works? <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes please explain
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes it's clear
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes we reside in Harare and at the farm out of Harare,,,but we can be found in Harare most days
22/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Last time when we made some initial payments we used the Mukuru facility
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Ok i have been to his offices before, i know the place
22/11/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used i.e. Paying using Mukuru through Mr. Shorwi. Now, if you wish to make the payment through Mr. Shorwi, you can either do it using his FBC Bank Details and making a cash deposit to that, or by using the same mode, i.e. Mukuru.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 642 4108: That's fine, i will make payment at his offices in Broadlands Road emerald Hill Harare
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 642 4108: I will use Mr Rajan
22/11/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is fine please, you can use that mode to make the payment please. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
22/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Ok thanks Noted
22/11/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
22/11/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
22/11/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
22/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 642 4108: Yes understood
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 642 4108: All clear please move foward
