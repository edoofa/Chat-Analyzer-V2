12/08/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Yes!
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Are we doing it here or on the line
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here, the grant discussion!
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright!
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Yes please
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 622 0393: This has surely on another level inspired me more
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Through trying as much as possible to follow up with the EWYL time table and appreciating the work I'm assigned to do along with the assistance
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Thank you so much ma'am, so much empowering.
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 622 0393: So there are more quests coming?
16/08/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, soon!
16/08/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Great!
18/08/23, 7:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning!

Please accept my apologies for not being able to connect. I wasn't feeling well and had to take a day to rest.
18/08/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 622 0393: That's great!
18/08/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Wishing you more good health
18/08/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 278 4372: Wish you a quick recovery
19/08/23, 1:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can share the letters with deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com
19/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright

19/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 622 0393: It's indeed wonderful!

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. Let's make this session unforgettable!
18/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Noted!
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Besides this you have gotten my other inquiries right?
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have marked you present, Utloile!
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, you can share your field of interest and I can convey this to your Career Development Officer.
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Okay ma'am, thank you 😊
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright. I am in the science field, school of physical science and chemical engineering. I'm studying BSc hons in chemistry. Hopefully I will major into medicinal and pharmacological chemistry
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Ohhh my apologies, regarding the AI I am actually using it already.
18/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Utloile! I have shared your interests with our Career Development Officer.
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 622 0393: How do I get contacts because I have tried sharing my story on my end it's not really giving output
18/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
18/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Again you promised to share with us the materials to use for enhancing our approach
18/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 622 0393: It is very amazing
18/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Utloile, I wanted to share about the video. You can follow these instructions to create  a video!
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let's conclude today's session. We will connect according to our timetable.

Good night!✨
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 622 0393: I mean documents and information of how far people have benefited from Edoofa lately
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright ma'am. Thank you for today's session

So, do you have any doubts about it? Did you find something new or useful?
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Greetings ma'am, isn't it the same we discussed
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as promised in our $300 training session,  I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:

- Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!

15/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 622 0393: This is very interesting!
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 622 0393: On social media, though I'm not sure how we can reach out effectively to people
15/11/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
