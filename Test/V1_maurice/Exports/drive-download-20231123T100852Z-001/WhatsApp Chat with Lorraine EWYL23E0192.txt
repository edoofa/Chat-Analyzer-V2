I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 83978 22536: *What l have understood*

The Diwali festival,is the festival of lights.The  culture belief on this festival is victory of good over evil.It is associated with the return of Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana.Also ,it is associated with the worship of Goddess Laxmi , goddess of wealth and prosperity.
People like candles and invite her into their homes.
Since this is done by a family and community ,it strengths their bond.Another significance is that it fosters a spirit of unity and compassion as families and people in the society will be sharing gifts through charity or communal feasts.The festival also stands as a reminder that love, forgiveness and understanding are essential ingredients for a harmonious fulfilling life
15/11/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon Lorraine_*
