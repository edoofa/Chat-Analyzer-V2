03/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 358 9903: we will
03/08/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I shall wait for your response.
03/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 358 9903: okay
03/08/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Evening to you all
03/08/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
03/08/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Yes  go ahead
03/08/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Yes you take us through
03/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
03/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
03/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/08/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Noted
03/08/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 278 1543: It's is not possible but only one institution would be ideal
03/08/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
03/08/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
03/08/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
03/08/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Okay
03/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 278 1543: It is noted
03/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
03/08/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 278 1543: This is doable
03/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
03/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 278 1543: It's ok clear
03/08/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
03/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 278 1543: So does this mean the $2800 includes the scholarship? This is not very clear
03/08/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, this is just an example for your better understanding. 

let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum, which makes a Total Fee, Tuition Fee of $1800 + Hostel fee of $1000 = $2800 per annum. 

Now, since your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.
03/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 which can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 

I hope we are clear here?
03/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 278 1543: The break down is clear were then is the scholarship
03/08/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand your statement here, could you please help me understand it better?
03/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 278 1543: My question is does the $2800 include the scholarship
03/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772781543, yes indeed, however, this is just an example and you can get a high quantum of scholarship as well. The university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, O Levels, co-curricular activities, and Edoofa's recommendation too. 

Also, I would encourage you to be patient, as each and everything will be informed to you once your registration process starts, this is just a brief of what your admission process holds and what the cost breakdown looks like, for your understanding.

I hope we are clear here?
03/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Much clear now
03/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 278 1543: The reason for my concern was if we will be able to raise such an amount considering our current state int he economy
03/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that. So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
03/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 278 1543: As of now we are on the same page
03/08/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 278 1543: As of the 750 when is the deadline
03/08/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Each university has it own deadline period, however, as mentioned earlier you can consider the deadline period of two weeks.
03/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Ok hopefully it will not crush with 3<Rd term fees
03/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772781543 Indeed you will not since your registration process will start after August 2023 for a rough idea you can consider that it will stretch till mid-September or early October. Also, once you start with your EWYL Program, you can learn and earn too. So please do not worry you have ample amount of time.
03/08/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Ok thank you
03/08/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
03/08/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Noted thank you

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
23/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Munyaradzi,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 358 9903: sorry was travelling hence could  not communicate on time
25/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand we can connect now if you are available to connect.
25/10/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 358 9903: what we have discussed Iam all good
26/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 358 9903: can you explain further
26/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 358 9903: noted
26/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 358 9903: understood
26/10/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Good Afternoon yes we can but that depends on network since in travelling
27/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 358 9903: lets do
27/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 358 9903: reappear meaning resisting the examination
27/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Reappear means giving A- level again if Munyaradzi is not able to achieve favorable results. However, I am sure nothing like this will happen.
27/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
27/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Munyaradzi,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 5:16 am - +263 77 358 9903: ok can you explain further
28/10/23, 6:25 am - +263 77 358 9903: Morning
28/10/23, 6:25 am - +263 77 358 9903: my battery was flat
30/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 358 9903: afternoon like  8 said will be doing a lot of travelling so network issues
30/10/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that completely, however, if you are actively present the discussion will hardly take 5 minutes of your time, please?
30/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 358 9903: lets continue
30/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
30/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 358 9903: we are on the same page
30/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 358 9903: have a question
30/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
30/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 358 9903: will the admission and scholarship percentage take place before the final results
30/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, and as mentioned above if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
31/10/23, 5:37 am - +263 77 358 9903: noted thank you
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 358 9903: if you you can reclarify on cost
31/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please let me know which cost are you referring to here since the cost breakdown was explained to you in June if you want me to reiterate it I can do that, please?
31/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 358 9903: the cost breakdown because the fone i was using be crashed hence could not retrieve the information
31/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
31/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 358 9903: please proceed
31/10/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
31/10/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
31/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 358 9903: clear
31/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
31/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
31/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 358 9903: So what do scholarship cover  if the parents meet the cost of $2050
31/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773589903 the tuition fee of $1800 in the above example is after scholarship only and the $2050 covers the food and accommodation as well and after the results are out if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
31/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 358 9903: ok
31/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
31/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 358 9903: we can proceed
31/10/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Munyaradzi's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Munyaradzi is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 358 9903: yeah Iam
31/10/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
31/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 358 9903: thank you for the time pass our regards to your family as well
14/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Munyaradzi,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Munyaradzi,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Greatings Ms
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too @263773589903 may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
15/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 358 9903: yes have gone through it
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Is te 50% going to be reviewed or remains like that
15/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 358 9903: accoring to our discussions is the the only University that has offered us place? or others are still making reviews
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here if you recall our previous discussions, for a student to receive a 50% scholarship he/she should have at least 2E passes. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
15/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as every university has its own evaluation time, for now you application has been accepted by the Galgotias University as soon as we receive any update from other universities we shall notify you.
15/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 358 9903: so we should wait for all the  universities before wemake a final decision
15/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773589903 Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
15/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
15/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Iam clear
15/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 358 9903: No
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotia's by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Its noted
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so now may I know if you are available to discuss the offer letter?
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 358 9903: lets continue
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 358 9903: its okay we can continue
15/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 358 9903: 1 $1800 and after 50% it will be $900
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 358 9903: 2 its 4 years
15/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 358 9903: 8 semester
15/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 358 9903: 3 $300 waived off under early registration
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Its 750USD
15/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 358 9903: yes it does
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 358 9903: the accommodation part is tricky if he stays independently
15/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773589903 I understand your concern as a parent, however, all our Edoofians stay off campus since it is more cheaper compared to on-campus and even gives the freedom to cook for yourself.  I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the required assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 358 9903: that sounds perfect
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Munyaradzi,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Good Day
was supposed respond
16/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 358 9903: interms of staying independently its the parent who provides the food stuffs?
16/11/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773589903 no please, the food is also included in the off-campus plus the students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well.
16/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 358 9903: understood
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 358 9903: this was quite clear
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 358 9903: the entire 750 by 28 Novemeber
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 358 9903: please do so
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 358 9903: this is better option
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 358 9903: we reside in Harare
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Noted will do so during the course of next week
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Needmore Maphosa for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 358 9903: will use Mr Rajan
16/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 358 9903: can you Munyaradzi

16/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I have granted you the admin please go ahead and add Munyaradzi to the group.

17/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, so would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

17/11/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please through Mr. Needmore you even paid your enrollment fee and that is why we suggest that so that it will be easy for you?
17/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 358 9903: will see the best option during the course of next week
17/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in the meantime let me share the details with you if you might need them for reference. 

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore

ACC NUMBER: 5290638027654065

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664
17/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 358 9903: will advise as soon as we have made payment
17/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
18/11/23, 8:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Munyaradzi,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 358 9903: Greetings have read and understood
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 358 9903: was busy with garden since I"m not able to do it during the week
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 9:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand do let me know when you will be able to go through the messages above?
18/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 358 9903: doing so right now
18/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 358 9903: its clear
18/11/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 358 9903: yea it does
18/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 358 9903: what if he earns more  it further reducers the payments by the parents
18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 358 9903: sorry to take you back a little
18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 358 9903: in the event he gets favourable results from his A level will his scholarship  be reviewed
18/11/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as mentioned above there is no upper limit to the amount of credits he earns.
18/11/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
18/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 358 9903: meaning it further reduces the parents contribution
18/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 358 9903: clear
18/11/23, 10:00 am - ~ LEMRH added +263 78 226 0861
18/11/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 358 9903: the EWYL is between the student and his mentors
18/11/23, 10:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please if students sometimes are not available parents can also connect.
18/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 358 9903: okay
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now to attend to the last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities.

18/11/23, 10:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please you can go through the insights when network gets better, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
18/11/23, 10:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
18/11/23, 10:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 358 9903: noted
18/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day and weekend ahead.

19/11/23, 12:13 am - +263 77 278 1543: Thanks Kirti I was following closely it only I was tied up but we are together in the discussion
20/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 358 9903: yes we did though today tide up by work
20/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 358 9903: but the University has not sent the offer letter direct to us but the one you sent only
20/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay, I was occupied in a meeting. With this, let me attend to the third query shared by you regarding the official admission letter - The letter is issued by the university once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
20/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can go through the response and share your thoughts since our available hours for today are now over, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm. so that we can continue with our discussion. I hope you will be available have a great evening.
21/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Munyaradzi,

21/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you were clear with your concern yesterday?
21/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 278 1543: Yes we are clear
21/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 278 1543: As for now we do not have any questions
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 358 9903: yes I did
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 358 9903: from the link, there is mention of on-campus accommodation what of off-campus should it be mentioned the distance from campus
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The off-campus accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 358 9903: would love our son near the campus to reduce the cost of transport
21/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do not worry about that we will be assisting him here as well. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from.
