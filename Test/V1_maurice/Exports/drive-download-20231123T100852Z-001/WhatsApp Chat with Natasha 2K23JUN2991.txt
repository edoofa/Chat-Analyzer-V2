I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend, with regard to our previous conversation, and since we were unable to continue our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 3555094: Good afternoon.
30/10/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 3555094: We are ready to continue with our discussion
30/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - +260 96 6414725: We look forward to that
30/10/23, 4:42 pm - +260 96 6414725: Indeed, we look forward as it will define  our expectations
30/10/23, 4:43 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted, and thank you. We look forward to our daughter being admitted into the journey with Edoofa
30/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level / grade 12 Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/10/23, 5:28 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted
30/10/23, 5:28 pm - +260 96 3555094: We have reviewed all the benefits. Ready to proceed
30/10/23, 5:30 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is noted
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, grade 12 and 10 results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Natasha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days and delays are Natasha's scholarship application, please I would encourage you to be transparent with us, and let us know if there are some kind of challenges that you are facing?
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - +260 96 6414725: Good afternoon
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - +260 96 6414725: We are available and try to acknowledge what we read. We shall allocate more time so that are constantly available for the discussion
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - +260 96 6414725: Sincere apologies
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes I have been available from 2pm
01/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 96 6414725: Am still available
01/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 96 6414725: So far am very clear of the process and the benefits gained
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 4:16 pm - +260 96 6414725: Well understood. This is of great help to the stability of fees and ensure effective planning
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 4:45 pm - +260 96 6414725: The explanation is understood
01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 5:44 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is a great offer to the parents
01/11/23, 5:46 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes, we have followed and understand the application of financial ease
01/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/11/23, 6:41 pm - +260 96 6414725: No am not aware
Kindly share info4mation on the subject
01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
01/11/23, 7:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted.
01/11/23, 7:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes, I agree.
01/11/23, 7:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: Indeed, the endowment plan gives a real edge to the students. Well noted
01/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 7:47 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted.
01/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes I agree
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 6:03 am - +260 96 6414725: Noted and thank you

02/11/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. In that case, let us reconnect today at 02:00 pm CAT.
02/11/23, 12:28 pm - +260 96 3555094: Noted with thanx. Good afternoon

Kindly note that we have been available waiting for your communi action. 

Kindly advise if we shall resume on Monday at 2pm
03/11/23, 7:13 pm - +260 96 6414725: Your guidance will be appreciated.
03/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with a meeting and had a really tight schedule, we can continue with our discussion if you are available since it will not take much of your time.
03/11/23, 7:32 pm - +260 96 6414725: Good Evening, Due to our committed program, we propose we continue on Monday, same time.
03/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I understand completely, in that case, let us reconnect on Monday. at 02:30 pm.
03/11/23, 7:40 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted. we shall be available.
06/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 96 3555094: Good afternoon
06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 96 3555094: We are available. Thank you
06/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260963555094 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/11/23, 8:13 pm - +260 96 3555094: Sorry for taking this long to respond
06/11/23, 8:14 pm - +260 96 3555094: Everything is well understood
06/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 8:35 pm - +260 96 3555094: Am  clear
06/11/23, 8:37 pm - +260 96 6414725: Well understood
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 8:46 pm - +260 96 6414725: The guidance is noted
06/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 8:52 pm - +260 96 6414725: We understand the process and appreciate the associated costs
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Natasha's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
06/11/23, 9:00 pm - +260 96 6414725: We are excited for this process and look forward to Natasha enrollment with Edoofa scholarship
06/11/23, 9:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: We also propose that we resume the discussion tomorrow as its now 9pm here in Zambia.
06/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is noted. We like forward to receiving the acceptance letter
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - +260 96 6414725: Good night, and stay blessed

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening  Parents and Natasha,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasi
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:10 pm - +260 96 6414725: Thank you, much appreciated
17/11/23, 6:11 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes, we have gone through the letter, and we look forward to our interactions
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 6:19 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted
17/11/23, 6:20 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted and thank you.  Looking forward to fruitful discussion
17/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 6:27 pm - +260 96 6414725: Based on the letter, the responses to the questions are:
1. Per annum tuition fees after scholarship US$1225
2. Accommodation fee $1200
3. Registration fee $750 to be adjusted to the total fees
17/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
17/11/23, 6:38 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted
17/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
17/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
17/11/23, 6:44 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is noted
17/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with Natasha's annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that she will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
17/11/23, 6:45 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted and thank you. Well clarified
17/11/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we have established the] tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 6:50 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes its clear. Very clear
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how [Natasha] can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes, the illustration is well understood.
17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
18/11/23, 8:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. @260966414725 I kindly request you to please respond to the messages either through texts or voice notes, as when you react to the message we are unable to see that and hence we lose our connection and that is what happened yesterday, so since we were unable to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available now to connect with us?
18/11/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 6414725: Afternoon 
Yes, we can focus on the registration fees
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837 and $838, with a six-month gap between them.
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
18/11/23, 2:27 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted and thank you
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 6414725: Information is clear
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 2:30 pm - +260 96 6414725: May you kindly share a brochure about the University,  please.
18/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please do not worry, we will be sharing the university insights with you as well after we complete our discussion.
18/11/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 6414725: Does the period include public holidays, Saturday n Sunday?
18/11/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 6414725: We shall be explaining to our daughter on the 26th and 27th November when she comes back, hence the question.
18/11/23, 2:35 pm - +260 96 6414725: This will help so much.
Otherwise, so far, we understand the process and  information shared
18/11/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
18/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
18/11/23, 3:08 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is noted
18/11/23, 3:09 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is very clear
18/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are actively present right now so that we can complete our discussion I can stretch for 10 more minutes for you?
18/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 96 6414725: Sorry about that.
However the information is understood
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
18/11/23, 3:16 pm - +260 96 6414725: Understood
18/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 3:18 pm - +260 96 6414725: This sounds good.  We shall advise by Monday the best mode for our payment
18/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is  alright please, let me share the details just for refernce.

18/11/23, 3:26 pm - +260 96 6414725: So far so good. Well understood

18/11/23, 4:40 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted and thank you. Will go through and appreciate the instructions
20/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natasha!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by GGI. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from GGI as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - +260 96 6414725: Thank you
20/11/23, 1:14 pm - +260 96 6414725: As a family, we have discussed the letter. We look forward to discussing gbour our daughter, Natasha, who is coming back home this Saturday.

Otherwise, we are excited with the offer.
20/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, Indeed you must be excited to discuss the same with Natasha and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - +260 96 6414725: Our family discussion was well, and the offer looks good. 

One question which arose was why only one offer received, hence no where to compare and contrast.
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - +260 96 6414725: Thanks foe the clarification. Very much understood
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Let me help you understand even more better. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - +260 96 6414725: What... thos is good. Share more details about the transfer option
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/11/23, 1:51 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is very clear, and we understand
20/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - +260 96 6414725: As a family we are positive about this journey and we look forward to have a discussion with Natasha so that we can explain to her the expectations of this journey
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Natasha,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
