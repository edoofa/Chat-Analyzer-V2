09/11/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
14/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 727 2005: Not really. Please shed some light on it

14/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
14/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 727 2005: Three projects are:

14/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 727 2005: *What do you understand from project 2?*

In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
15/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 78 727 2005: Glad to know that
15/11/23, 8:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
15/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay I will make sure I'm actively participating
15/11/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
15/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
15/11/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
15/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 727 2005: ✍️Noted.
15/11/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
15/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
15/11/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

Is a project that looks into us the Edoofa members to dive deep into the community and raise awareness to the people in my very own community so that they know about the Edoofa program and also that they are not reluctant to join while earning scholarship credits.
21/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 727 2005: Thats my understanding on the three projects

To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms

Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link: <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 727 2005: I already have an Instagram account
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 727 2005: But I will have to create the rest
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.

22/11/23, 6:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kudzai!
