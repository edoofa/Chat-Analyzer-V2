11/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority
11/10/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days_. 

Session time will be Monday to Friday from 01:30-02:30 PM⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 350 1738: It's ok mam
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know if you will be able to do these sessions with me as parent?

11/10/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 350 1738: I will talk to him, he has to be available too
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, but may I know if Chelsy be available for the entire time from 01:30-02:30 PM?

12/10/23, 8:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would like to correct you here that my name is Ms. Saloni, or you can refer to me as Ms./Ms. Saloni/ma'am.
12/10/23, 8:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Secondly, you mentioned your unavailability before 2 PM, so I would like to inform you that we can have the sessions from 02:00-02:30 PM. I will fastrack your EWYL progress and then I can put the program on hold.
12/10/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
12/10/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Good day Ms Saloni. We can start
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/10/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
12/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 350 1738: You can mention them ma'am.
12/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 350 1738: It's ok ma'am thank you

13/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Ok mam
13/10/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Chelsy can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Yes mam
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Well understood
13/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
13/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Well understood but our A level Zimsec Examinations are starting on Monday
13/10/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Chelsy takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Chelsy is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
13/10/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

2.I am Chivandire Chelsy , a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. Now l want  my fellow school mates to use this opportunity to get high education abroad
