07/11/23, 4:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for NAME’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound? <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Its sound great .
07/11/23, 1:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Nyasha will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
07/11/23, 4:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I halfway go through the document and realized that as a parent who is committed to different things like work ,its difficulty for me to stand on behalf of Nyasha.My suggestion is  to wait for the child to participate herself on 20 November. She will  fully join us after completing her examination .
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, we won't begin before Nyasha comes in, don't worry.
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
08/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Good afternoon
08/11/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Im good,yes we can begin
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
08/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Ok let me do that
08/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Sorry I have a question,can i join the on behalf of Nyasha?
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Nyasha takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Nyasha is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
08/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do it, please let me know.
