04/11/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Aaliyah, I am the senior mentor in the EWYL Team. Along with almost 600 students that I am accountable for, I also have a team with me and I am responsible for their growth, exposure, and experience. My first duty is always to look after my students but simultaneously as a leader, I need to see that my team also gets the advantage of such opportunities. As the reason, I have been given the responsibility of another partner university. It never means that I don't love you Aaliyah or don't care about you, it just that I have to keep a balance and we all want to respect what has been offered.

08/11/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 421 1931: Yes l have understood as mentioned in the document below
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Aaliyah, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 421 1931: Okay sure
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!

15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 421 1931: I'm still reaching out to the students
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
