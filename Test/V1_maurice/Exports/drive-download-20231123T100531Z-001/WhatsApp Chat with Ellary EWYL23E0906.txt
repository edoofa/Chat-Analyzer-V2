Are you ready for the session🚀
20/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 610 0421: Morning
Yes very ready
20/11/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
20/11/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
20/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 610 0421: This is Ellary.
The other number is my mom's
20/11/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you and your mother for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
20/11/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Ellary, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
20/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright.
My long term goals include having a Bachelor of Science degree in my desired program which is Medical Laboratory Technology and having a Master's and a PhD.
I think the EWYL program will groom me more in the sector through the research
20/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's an impressive set of goals, Ellary! Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology is a solid foundation, and aiming for a Master's and PhD demonstrates your commitment to excellence in your field. It's great to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable stepping stone for your research endeavors.
20/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 610 0421: No
Enlighten me
20/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 610 0421: Understood
20/11/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright
20/11/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 610 0421: Yes
20/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
20/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
20/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 610 0421: My network is very bad.
The documents are still yet to finish downloading
20/11/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand!
20/11/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me know when you have gone through it.
20/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 610 0421: I'm all done 
These are really good and helpful, I honestly look forward to more of them
20/11/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 610 0421: Yes, definitely!
20/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Ellary?
20/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 610 0421: Very well
20/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
20/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
20/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright.
1. Starting with my Mentor, who will be guiding me throughout this journey, Ms Aditi.
Then we have Ms Sanjana, the Head of the Department, her role is to monitor the conversations.
Then we have Ms Davis, the Head Coach, she'll also be mentoring us and we'll hear from her every week.

2. To make sure my academic journey is Great!
To ensure I'm given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India.
And to work towards the 2 core objectives.

3. A ... Newsletter

4. It is a section of the newsletter where students get inspired by other students who have their incredible stories written there
20/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great! Also it's Ms Davi.
20/11/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
20/11/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 610 0421: Yes
20/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
20/11/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, this is it for today's session, we will meet tomorrow with renewed enthusiasm.🤩
20/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright
I'm done with the document
20/11/23, 9:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can share your understanding and we will discuss it in our tomorrow's session.
20/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay I mainly understood about the Projects, which are divided into parts, to make it easier for students.
And each project has a lot of benefits
20/11/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Ellary, you should answer in detail so that I can make sure that we are on same page about it.
20/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright.
So the document says the EWYL program is supposed to provide accessibility, affordability in my higher education and make me employable.
It encourages me to be aware and to aquire skills, such as online skills, good content writing amongst others.
All this will result in me being able to impact the society positively.
Also a positive impact on junior students and as well as spreading the message of Edoofa.
And then there are Projects, which have all benefits stated in categories.
And they are in activities, making them less overwhelming.
And the payouts are mentioned as well
20/11/23, 10:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is Fantastic!
21/11/23, 8:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @263786100421 
Hope you are well.

So I hope you are thrilled to begin this session
21/11/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 610 0421: Morning
Yes I'm ready
21/11/23, 8:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!!
21/11/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/11/23, 8:29 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
21/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 610 0421: Understood
21/11/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?
21/11/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 610 0421: Yes
21/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
21/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright, so the explanation was about the first Project, which is about cooperate alliences, where by I reach out to the decision makers there.
Then I share Edoofa's vision, and then set-up meeting.
And creating a LinkedIn account is a suggestion, where I download it from Playstore and create an account.
And also, I could start by asking those surrounding me
21/11/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic!
21/11/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
21/11/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
21/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through this?
21/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 610 0421: From what I read I understand, that for me to look for the right company I need to take note of certain characteristics such as the nature of the company, where it's supposed to be student-centric or recreational.
The Financial stability of the company should also be considered, and also the scale of company and the background the founder.
And then I can use Platforms such as LinkedIn and Google for further research
21/11/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
21/11/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

21/11/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently this project is on hold due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.
21/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright, so when do I start?
21/11/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will inform you when we will resume with this project.
21/11/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
21/11/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
21/11/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
21/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 610 0421: I've understood that for the second project,which is community building.
This when I reach out to students that graduated from senior secondary school, to be part of the Edoofa scholarship program. So they have to obviously fill the application forms, after I write their names down. And this can be done especially through Social media platforms and then you'll earn your scholarship credits
21/11/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

21/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
21/11/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
21/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright
21/11/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ELLARY/ADITI/21NOV23*
21/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
21/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 610 0421: Alright

21/11/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 610 0421: Okay
21/11/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/11/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/11/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
