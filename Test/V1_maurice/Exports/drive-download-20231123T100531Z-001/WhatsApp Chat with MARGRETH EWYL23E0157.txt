Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 993 1550: Yes!
02/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
02/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
02/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 993 1550: I am following
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you know what is SEO or influencer marketing?
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 993 1550: I don't know ma'am
02/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
02/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 993 1550: Ok l understand now
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to start a new journey🤩
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
02/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
02/08/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 993 1550: I prefer Tuesday and Friday ma'am

Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.
