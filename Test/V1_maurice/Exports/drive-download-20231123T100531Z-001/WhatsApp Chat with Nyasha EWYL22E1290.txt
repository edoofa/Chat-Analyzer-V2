I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday
📅 28/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*

13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true that you can use the grant and the scholarship credits at the same time. You can use the one that is higher. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If you earn more scholarship credits, then you can surely redeem them.
13/10/23, 1:27 pm - +267 77 814 654: So on Nyasha's case it means she can't redeem the scholarship credits because they are little but can redeem the grant instead
13/10/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Grant can only be availed if she actively participates in sessions and projects with me. In case of no participation, the grant might be revoked.
13/10/23, 1:34 pm - +267 77 814 654: Ma'am right now Nyasha's fone is refusing to connect to all Internets she is not unable to participate well because of that and myself the parent not having money right now for her to buy a new phone as I am having some challenges but hopefully things will settle for the good
13/10/23, 1:40 pm - +91 73034 51843: So if I uses that which is high what happens to that which is little
13/10/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It will still stay in your account, you can use them in the second year if they are greater than grant amount.
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +91 73034 51843: Ma'am which account because I don't have any
13/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I mean we will keep a track of these virtual scholarship credits that you have earned.

01/11/23, 9:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Nyasha I am the senior mentor in the EWYL Team. Along with almost 600 students that I am accountable for, I also have a team with me and I am responsible for their growth, exposure, and experience. My first duty is always to look after my students but simultaneously as a leader, I need to see that my team also gets the advantage of such opportunities. As a reason, I was not present at the airport, and similarly, I have been given the responsibility of another partner university. It never means that I don't love you Nyasha or don't care about you, it just that I have to keep a balance and we all what to respect what has been offered. You will absolutely love what is going to happen tomorrow dear, and I am sure you will video call me tomorrow?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
