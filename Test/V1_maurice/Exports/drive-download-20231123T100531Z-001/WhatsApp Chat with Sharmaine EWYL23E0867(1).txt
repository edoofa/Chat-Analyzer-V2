Are you ready for the session?
14/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 295 0153: Morning
14/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 295 0153: Yes I am ready
14/11/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
14/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 295 0153: Well noted
14/11/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
14/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 295 0153: My long term goals,are pursuing more eduction till l achieve my dreams and hel ping the needy when I have passed
14/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic mindset, and it's truly commendable that you're taking proactive steps toward becoming an independent and self-driven individual.
14/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 295 0153: EWYL will help me by teaching me what is need for me to achieve my dreams
14/11/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's correct!
14/11/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 295 0153: No
14/11/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/11/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 295 0153: I understand now
14/11/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 295 0153: Happy to hear about the team, how a you  Mrs,Sanjana and Ms,Davi
14/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, they are good and currently engaged in a meeting and they will surely connect with you soon.
14/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
14/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 295 0153: So intresting
14/11/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

15/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

21/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
21/11/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
21/11/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SHARMAINE/ADITI/21NOV23*
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
