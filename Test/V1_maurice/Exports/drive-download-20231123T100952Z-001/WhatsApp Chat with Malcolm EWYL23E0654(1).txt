How are you? Are you ready for your session?🏆
29/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes lm ready
29/09/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Wow that’s really great ,have a good time and good celebrations
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright Tuesday it is
03/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Afternoon
03/10/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Malcolm!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes afternoon
03/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noo l don’t
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Wow this Is really great
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright this is great lm happy to interact with you all
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes very interesting indeed
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 366 5167: L alright
03/10/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you are done reading the newsletter?

03/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 366 5167: My connection is quite slow today
03/10/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, Malcom! However, since our session time over for today, we will connect tomorrow at the same time.
04/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 366 5167: Alright thankyou

04/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
04/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright let me brief you
04/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Honestly l really was fascinated by the three quotes on the news letter very interesting
04/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Especially this one “Master your circumstances rather than be ruled by them.”
04/10/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
04/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes that’s really true
04/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Malcolm?
04/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 366 5167: The hall of fame section is great it really shares light on soo many things including the experience and the journey the Proud Edoofian experienced it’s wonderful and how the EDOOFA made everything possible
04/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Malcolm!
04/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 366 5167: It sounds really great and exciting
04/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 366 5167: And true
04/10/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
04/10/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
04/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 366 5167: 1.well the EWYL platform is made up of three EDOOFIAN counselors 
.the goals are 1)Making sure that my academic journey is great 
2.And to ensure that l get enough opportunities to self finance myself in my academic journey in India 
3amd above all work towards attaining the objective 
Well using newsletters
4 soo basically hall of fame is like records and articles that are made up of past legends or people who have achieved something great and they are well known and respected <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good Job! 🌟

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

04/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes , the document is made up of two projects and each project is made up of various activities that should be tackled and done correctly and l believe l am supposed to be interacting with various companies and people who work in these companies for example the employees and the owners and l get to ask them a few questions and direct them to EDOOFIAN mentor and l should use official websites or the linkedln application and create my very own proffessional account that l would be using professionally for these interactions too and for the first project l am supposed to find these various individuals on the internet for example by using the application that l have mentioned above and then ask them more about the decision making and makers and also give details and pass on the EDOOFA message to them and connect with them through video calls in which my mentors get with them and reporting on all the progress please

05/10/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cx-XdXGgW_-/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
05/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh if may ask , how can one really find out if the company is legit or not
05/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright thankyou lm going to check that out now
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

06/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright thankyou very much will get on it right away too
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
