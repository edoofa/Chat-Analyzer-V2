22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 338 7901: So with our counsellor ..am really impressed with the fact that Edoofa scholarship has worked an enrolled more than 2000 students allover giving people opportunities and having a counsellor who can direct you in the next step and guiding us every step . The Edoofa EWYL that a learner though this might even end up paying less through doing and completing the tasks given hence reduce even the pressure of monies needed and i learnt that so far a student in record has earbed $3000 through this EWYL. 
Education abroad is really expensive and through Edoofa scholarship students will be able to do desired courses cheaper in India than anywhere else . So in this journey parents involvement is crutial so that together we can plan for the life of the student abroad and we will be well informed
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 455 3293: The Edoofa Program in itself is a great opportunity to most talented  students who might have  high ambitions but unable to accomplish them because of financial constraints.Edoofa has made it  simpler by the provision of the Scholarship itself ie 50-100%scholarship; The counseling program in guiding the family about the program, assisting in University enrollment with and the EWYL program which enables the students to further reduce university fees by earning credits thus  making the educational dream a reality in lessening the parental burdens in financial balancing
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the detailed information and for sharing your conversation with our counselor. Indeed, Edoofa's approach in enrolling over 2000 students and guiding each step through counseling is impressive. The EWYL program stands out as a practical means to potentially lessen the financial strain on students by earning credits and reducing the overall expenses.

The provision of 50-100% scholarships is a game-changer for students with high aspirations but limited financial means. The counseling's focus on university enrollment and the EWYL program's ability to further mitigate fees are crucial elements that showcase how Edoofa eases the financial load on parents.
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Am ready
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ready
