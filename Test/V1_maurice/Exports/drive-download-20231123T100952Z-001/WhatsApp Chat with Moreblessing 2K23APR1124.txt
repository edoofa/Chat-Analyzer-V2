As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

09/09/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 222 3447: On behalf of the family we are all fine. The unfortunate part is More blessings lost her cell phone as a result has not been communicating  l an proceeding there to replace the phone. She will communicate as soon as she is back on line. Most probably Tuesday 12 September 2023. We are really grateful to be part of Edoofa
21/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, parents and my dear student.

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

18/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Step1 - the interaction  with Edoofa  Step 2 - Edoofa counseling  Step 3 - Registration and Counseling Step 4 - Interviews  for Edoofa Step 5 - Acceptance  and Scholarship  Step 6  - The University  Admission  Cycle
18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

20/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I'm sorry for the late reply network  here is a bit challenging
20/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize for the delay in your response. I understand that network issues can sometimes cause delays. It's great to hear that we are on the same page regarding the admission process.
20/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
20/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Indeed  I'm ready
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I really appreciate  the endowment plans for the students who are yet to write their A- level  Exams
20/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Noted, it sounds  interesting
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Yes it does resonate
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Yes it does
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I'm following  ,so far I have nothing to inquire
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes we are on the same page
23/10/23, 6:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Moreblessing!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time
23/10/23, 6:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 6:31 am - +263 78 634 2510: Morning  thank you l will be available
23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Moreblessing!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 222 3447: Weekend was fine
23/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 634 2510: It was a wonderful  weekend
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I'm available for the session
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 634 2510: It's now clear
23/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I agree
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 634 2510: All   clear
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening Dear parents and Moreblessing.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

18/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 222 3447: We have noted the times proposed we no problem with the girl would be available full time especially staring Monday 20 November.
18/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 222 3447: We thank Edoofa for affording us this precious opportunity we are surely indebted to you
20/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Good day
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Thank you for letting me know. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 115 2303: I'm ready
20/11/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/11/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Noted  , we can proceed with our discussion
20/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 115 2303: 1. 900 USD
2. 3 years ( 6semesters)
3. 300
4. 750
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes its clear now
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 115 2303: All clear
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 115 2303: It is great that they understand students feelings
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 115 2303: All clear we can move forward
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes I'm following
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes I'm would like you to explain
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 115 2303: It is clear
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 115 2303: I stay in Harare
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Thank you so much
20/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 115 2303: We are going to coordinate with him
20/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes I would love to be provided with the account details
20/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 115 2303: OK thank you
20/11/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most wellcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Noted
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes I'm following
20/11/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Yes it clearly demonstrates
20/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 115 2303: Right now l don't have any queries
20/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
