14/09/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
14/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 345 7746: Of course 😊
14/09/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
14/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 345 7746: Oke my mother just joined the group with me,and l stay with her.She is a police officer that's why she is always busy she is mostly out on patrols
14/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 345 7746: And my father is also in the group ,he is currently living in Harare were he is managing his work ,he is into transport business.Both my parents are supporting my education aswell as funding it.
14/09/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Wow, this is so unique, I have never heard someone's parents belonging to that designation when I talk to students.
14/09/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome them to the group, I am sure they will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
14/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 345 7746: They sure will😊
14/09/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you and a bit about your family, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 345 7746: Oke
14/09/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you know these objectives or not?

14/09/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, you have got the main idea behind it!
14/09/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/09/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 345 7746: Learn whilst earning program
14/09/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, Earn While You Learn Program!
14/09/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

May we begin with our session?
14/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Roselyne can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
