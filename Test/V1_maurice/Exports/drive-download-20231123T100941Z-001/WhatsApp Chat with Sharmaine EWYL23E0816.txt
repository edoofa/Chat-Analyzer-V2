25/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Dear Mentor, my name is Sharmaine Makwara and my EWYL group name is Sharmaine EWYL23E0816. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (27 Oct-203) to commence the procedure. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track
27/10/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Really? Wow! You know I also love cooking and reading! What do you like to read?
27/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 619 4849: I like reading novels and newspapers
27/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! So what's your favorite genre?
27/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Comedy,  romance and suspense
27/10/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely, I also like suspense! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 619 4849: No enlighten me please
27/10/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/10/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Quite clear
27/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
27/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yaa I can see EWYL is very helpful
27/10/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Okay that's great, its nice knowing you all
27/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yaa indeed
27/10/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/10/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session for today has come to an end. Kindly share your understanding of the document before that session. Let's plan to reconnect on Monday, as our sessions are not scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays.🌟

02/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
02/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Ok, from the document  I understood that the projects help a student to have a good interaction with other people, it also help for students to know how to do business online
02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Sharmaine!🌟
02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

02/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Firstly I have to identify the companies and talk to their decision makers, and also to make an app which you would help me to make then I'll have to  take their contact and also schedule a meeting with them which I  have to share the meeting time with you so that you will help in having a conversation with them
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: . I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, I am so excited to tell you that we are going to our orientation program tomorrow at one of our partner universities. I will be meeting my students for the first time, and I just cannot contain my excitement.🎉

06/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
06/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Ok, the main aim is to get in touch with companies, with potential to collaborate with Edoofa and willing to extent their help in the overall development of the student under Edoofa. For easier picking we must firstly look into the nature of the company, it should be either student centric or recreational or content centric platform. Also we must look at the scale of the company. It should neither be too big nor too small. Again its financial stability. The companies should be financial sound. Then the background of the founder. The founder should have a strong background.
06/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Sharmaine, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
06/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Thank you

And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
07/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yaa now I get it

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Good evening,_

Before diving into our session, I have something your seniors from India have created for you! Watch it!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzbBQ0CRRqP/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Good afternoon
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Maam I have a question
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes please?
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 619 4849: I'm supposed to create a group right
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, I will discuss that now!
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Ok
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024 or August 2025
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Ok
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 619 4849: In this project, I have to tell my teachers how lucky I am to qulify to the edofa program. I have to reach out to the local schools and talk to the headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program. I  can even start with my school and ask them to set up a meeting with the edafa director where they will both share ideas. I will also have to share my heardmasters details with you
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Sharmaine. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 619 4849: For now I don't have any
09/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, concluding today's session I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

14/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
14/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 619 4849: 1- Sakubva 1 High. No my school is not

2- I'm going to tell them the reason why I joined Edoofa and how it is going to help me. 

3- Manicaland
14/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
14/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yes I'll do that
14/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head?
14/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yes I have
14/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
14/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Yes sure
14/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
14/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
14/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Ok I will
14/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Everything is clear maam for now
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
14/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 619 4849: Well noted
14/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday- 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm

THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
14/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
14/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, you must maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.
19/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 619 4849: Okey, so what happened was that, there is this other day when I was invited to one of my friend's birthday. Everything was going so well but the problem started when my friends started doing improper things ; drinking alcohol and doing bad things with boys. I wanted to leave immediately because what they were doing was not in me but one of my friends stopped me and started to force me but I didn't give in to them rather I started to tell them the harm in what they were doing.Non of them listened to me. 

I left there with a broken heart, not believing that my friends could do that. On my way home I got a message from them saying that our relationship is over because I was too boring for them. I was extremely hurt by that because I loved my friends very much. 

After a while I later realized that they were never good friends and they didn't deserve me at all. I didn't let circumstances dictate my path rather I took charge of everything.
