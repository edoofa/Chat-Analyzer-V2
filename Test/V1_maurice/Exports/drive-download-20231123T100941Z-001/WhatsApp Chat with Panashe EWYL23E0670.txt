28/09/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It's truly admirable that you want to become an optometrist to help your mom and others with their eyesight challenges, especially during nighttime.

28/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Is there a possibility that I can also be made group so that I can just add them the network connection in the rural areas is a bit bad
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, Panashe!
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/09/23, 2:44 pm - ~ Pana🥰 added +263 71 392 6403 and +263 77 179 6874
28/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 984 5767: No ma'am would elaborate on them please
28/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, he *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Thank you ma'am I understand now
28/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I will do my very best to earn maximum credits
28/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Nice to meet you all and am looking forward to working with all of you
29/09/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🏆
29/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Afternoon ma'am how are you ,yes am ready
29/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have you gone through it?
29/09/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

03/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Panashe?

03/10/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After this, we can put your sessions on hold.
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK thank you ma'am
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 984 5767: We may continue

10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure! Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK ma'am I understand

Monday and Thursday  - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm

THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

09/11/23, 11:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, 

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
