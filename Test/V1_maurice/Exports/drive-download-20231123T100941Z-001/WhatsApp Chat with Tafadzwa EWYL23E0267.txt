How are you today? Are you ready for your session?
01/08/23, 3:21 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Hello miss A. Hope you are well. I have a request. Would it be possible for you to just send whatever we have to discuss per every session so that even if lm not online l will get the tasks when l get online because l honestly don't have a flexible schedule considering your working hours too. Thank you
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, My Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? I understand, may I ask about your schedule?
02/08/23, 4:40 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Unfortunately l don't have any flexible schedule ma'am. If lm working morning, l will be busy at from 8am to 3pm. 

And if it's afternoon then it will be from 12pm to 10pm. It's only on my off days when l get available all times.
02/08/23, 4:42 pm - +27 67 073 4530: That is why l was suggesting that you can just share whatever it is for each session, then whenever l get online l will see your messages and go thru them. Then if l don't understand l will raise a question which you can answer at the beginning of our next session.
03/08/23, 7:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Tafadzwa!

07/08/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🚀
07/08/23, 2:15 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Hello miss A
07/08/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask why are you late for your session? Are you facing any challenges?

07/08/23, 2:19 pm - +27 67 073 4530: But we can have the session

09/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
09/08/23, 2:35 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Greetings

09/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, would you like to answer the following?
10/08/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
10/08/23, 2:15 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Hello yes
10/08/23, 2:15 pm - +27 67 073 4530: My answers
10/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records your school is not connected with us.
10/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
10/08/23, 2:32 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes on it
10/08/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head ?

11/08/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
11/08/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
11/08/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
11/08/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

11/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
14/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Alright. About getting companies, which is the first project.Is there any other way l can go about that because l have tried getting in contact with some companies but still get no response
25/08/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We have currently put our project one on hold. However, whenever we decide to resume it, we will schedule a separate session for it. Does that sound alright?
25/08/23, 2:26 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Also will it be possible to get numbers of the other Edoofians so that l can communicate with them and we can actually get to know each other and help each other on these projects
25/08/23, 2:27 pm - +27 67 073 4530: OK thank you
25/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. However, upon your arrival in India, we will create a group of students, as the admissions process is still ongoing.
25/08/23, 2:29 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Alright got it thank you. So we can proceed
25/08/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
25/08/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
25/08/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
25/08/23, 2:32 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Absolutely
25/08/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, let's conclude our session here. We will reconvene on Monday since we don't have sessions on Saturday and Sunday. Have a fantastic weekend! 🌟

29/08/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Got it yes
29/08/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, , since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
