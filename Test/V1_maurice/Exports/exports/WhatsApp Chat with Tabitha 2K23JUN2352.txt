18/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
18/10/23, 10:44 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
18/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/10/23, 10:50 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
18/10/23, 10:51 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
18/10/23, 10:52 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/10/23, 10:55 am - +265 992 34 99 23: I hope the registration fee is still going to be deducted from the first years fees right?
18/10/23, 11:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265992349923 You will get a more clarification as we move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 11:02 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
18/10/23, 11:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/10/23, 11:02 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Sure thing
18/10/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/10/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/10/23, 11:04 am - +265 992 34 99 23: You can share one video at a time, so am well conversant with it

18/10/23, 11:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Tabitha, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
18/10/23, 12:23 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
18/10/23, 12:25 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: In the first video, mainly it just focuses on the introduction about the EDoofa program and ensuring that the key thing edoofians need to keep in mind is to follow instructions and be open minded

19/10/23, 9:25 am - +265 992 34 99 23: A gluten allergy is a condition where the immune system reacts negatively to the consumption of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This immune response can cause various symptoms and damage the lining of the small intestine, preventing the absorption of vitamins and minerals leading to medical complications .

To remedy this, people  need to follow a strict gluten-free diet, which means avoiding all foods that contain gluten. One has to Learn about which foods contain gluten and how to identify it on food labels. Common sources of gluten include bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods.

Always read the ingredients in foods before consuming them

One has to Prefer naturally gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, Rice and make sure to prevent using utensils that has been used to cook foods containing gluten.

One also has to be very careful with processed foods as they may contain hidden sources of gluten.
19/10/23, 9:26 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Gastrointestinal infections are infections of the stomach and the intestines like constipation , diarrhea, vomiting and irritable bowel syndrome.
What you eat can contribute to digestive problems. Choosing healthy habits contributes to preventive care and reduces the risks of these diseases.

A well balanced diet provides all the energy one needs to keep active throughout the day, nutrients for growth and repair, helping one to stay strong and healthy and prevent diet related illness.
By avoiding high fat foods, spicy foods , carbonated drinks, caffeine, processed and sugary foods , individuals with digestive problems can reduce the likelihood of experiencing symptoms like bloating, gas and stomach pain .

So if one wants to be healthy and prevent these diet related illness, there's need to eat a well balanced diet with enough fibers, fruits and vegetables as a diet high in fiber can promote regular bowel movements and digestive disorders can worsen by eating a diet high in saturated fats, sugars and processed foods which can lead to people eating more than the recommended amounts of sugar, salts and fats.
19/10/23, 9:26 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Eating healthy balanced diet plays a role in blood pressure control. Hypertension is controlled through diet by reducing too much salts and too much fats.
The more the salt one eats, the higher the blood pressure (hypertension) as salt makes your body hold onto water, now, the more the salts means extra water in the blood exerting more pressure on the blood vessel walls raising the blood pressure. Fat also causes the arteries to become hard and narrow , so the heart has to strain much harder to pump blood through them causing hypertension. Eating a low fat diet that includes lots of fibre like whole grain rice , plenty of fruit and vegetables also helps lower the blood pressure. Hence one has to eat healthy diets to control the amounts of salts and fats which causes hypertension. Diversified diet also helps one consume some minerals like calcium and magnesium which are good for basic hypertension management.
19/10/23, 9:26 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Proteins provides important essential amino acids that contribute to the mental and physical health of a child. Without enough protein, a child may experience symptoms like lack of concentration, slowed growth which affects their performance even in class leading to poor intelligence.
Proteins also help in protecting the body by repairing and building body tissues thus enabling wound healing which prevents excessive bleeding and in case of protein deficiency, it means there will be lowered immunity which will make people prune to  infections and increase the severity of infections and prolonged bleeding.

Proteins also help provide energy in the body when carbohydrates and fats intake is inadequate and when it is deficiency, the body will not have a back up energy source which will make people be too thin and may affect processes happening in the body. This may even cause stunt growth in children.

Proteins in the blood tend to pull water into our blood vessels. When the level of protein in the blood is low, water may leave the blood vessels and collect in the tissues causing edema thus the swelling of the tissues.

19/10/23, 9:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tabitha, Wishing you all a Wonderful Day!

Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (24th of October).
19/10/23, 9:55 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes , ofcourse
19/10/23, 10:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do: https://chat.whatsapp.com/HVWi7HHR8rwLs078gV9amN
19/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 992 34 99 23: I have joined
19/10/23, 10:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name isTabitha Kainga Monga, and my EWYL group name is Tabitha EWYL23E0368. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
19/10/23, 10:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 10:16 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright I'll
19/10/23, 10:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is M.Sc (Nutrition & Dietetics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 10:17 am - +265 992 34 99 23: That's correct
19/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 10:22 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes, I bet you have to choose one
19/10/23, 10:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @265992349923 Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 10:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 10:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 10:24 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes, he was clear on this one
19/10/23, 10:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 10:39 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Definitely
19/10/23, 10:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 10:46 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
19/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 10:50 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Ok
19/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 11:05 am - +265 992 34 99 23: The registration fee will be deducted from the EWYL account right?
19/10/23, 11:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee, Let me inform you that in the process of your EWYL journey, you'll find that the EWYL credits can be a applied to your university fees. However, it's worth noting that the registration fee typically needs to be paid at the time you receive an offer letter from the university . Therefore, your registration fees should already be covered by you. I hope that's clear.
19/10/23, 11:24 am - +265 992 34 99 23: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:27 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Maybe am not understanding clearly here .can you clarify
19/10/23, 12:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely @265992349923 As you can see that we have mention that the registration fees needs to be setlled when you are in your country which means the registration fees will be paid by you. Although, this registration fees is included in your first year fees, which means that this is not an additional fees.
19/10/23, 12:15 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: I think I wasn't clear about it
19/10/23, 12:15 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: I can't manage paying that amount
19/10/23, 12:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265992349923 I can understand that arranging this amount can be very challenging although I have something very exciting which will help you in paying the registration fees. May I know if we can proceed with this.
19/10/23, 12:18 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Okay
19/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/10/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yeah but this motivation alone won't help me pay the registration fee
19/10/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @265992349923 The exciting part is yet to come. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.


Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 5:26 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: I get that
19/10/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 7:21 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Go on
19/10/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 7:24 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Ok
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tabitha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 7:28 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: That's sounds good
19/10/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 7:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 7:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 7:30 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Understood
19/10/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 7:32 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
19/10/23, 7:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: No, it's clear
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 7:38 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: My concern still remains about the registration fee and the fact that it need to be paid , regardless of it being 50% within the 3 days indicated by the University, that still is alot of money
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @265992349923. Regarding the registration fee, I'd like to highlight that with the endowment benefit is designed to ease the financial burden on our students. It allows you to split the registration fee into two installments, with a one-month gap between them. This means you only need to pay half of the total amount after receiving your offer letter, giving you more time to plan your finances.
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please rest assured that we're here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns about the payment or any other aspect of your educational journey, feel free to reach out. We're dedicated to guiding you through the process and ensuring that you have a seamless experience.
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Ok
19/10/23, 7:46 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Minus the registration fee, can you tell me all other expenses I need to pay so that I have a clear picture than misunderstanding things again
19/10/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your concern and desire for transparency regarding the expenses related to your admission. In this case, I'm delighted to inform you that apart from the registration fee, you won't have any other expenses to worry about for your admission.
19/10/23, 7:48 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
19/10/23, 7:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 7:49 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Ofcourse

04/11/23, 12:10 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: I said I wont manage paying it
04/11/23, 12:11 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: That's why I said not to proceed with the offer letter so that you can refund the enrollment fee
04/11/23, 12:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I truly empathize with your financial situation, and I understand that you may be unable to meet the admission fee requirements.

14/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265992349923
15/11/23, 11:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tabitha,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:04 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes I have gone through it
15/11/23, 12:04 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: I have two questions
15/11/23, 12:05 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Firstly, why is the admission fee required to be paid using the same account I used for enrollment fee and not directly to the University?
15/11/23, 12:06 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: And then you said they will be a couple of university offers from which I will select which university to go to... should I still wait for the others?
15/11/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:09 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Go on
15/11/23, 12:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:16 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Fee is $900 per semester
It's 2 years course
Admission fee is $300 and one time payable
15/11/23, 12:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. What about the registration fees dear, Have you been able to find the same?
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: It's $750
15/11/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @265992349923. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 4 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
15/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University.
15/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Oky
15/11/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: It does
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic @265992349923. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Clearly
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Ok
15/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: That means instead of 750 I'll pay $600 of which will be paid in two installments
15/11/23, 12:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 12:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 12:51 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Am from Malawi
15/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265992349923. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: The bank

15/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let me attend your concern dear, Firstly as you are concerned regarding admission fee paid to the university. Dear, you can surely do that however as you must be aware that depositing money to India Account will demand higher transfer charges, however in order to have less transfer charges we recommend students to make the payment through the associates. This is the additional benefit for you, however you want to make the payment to the university we can surely work on that dear.
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, this is the first letter you will soon receive more offer letters from the multiple university till then can we proceed with the session?
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Sure thing
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Right @265992349923, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265992349923 May I know if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tabitha, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes , go on
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @265992349923. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 8:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265992349923 May I know if there is any challenge dear as we have been waiting for your response. Please do let us know if there's is any concern, we will be happy to help you.
17/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tabitha, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
17/11/23, 12:55 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: What time do you recommend?
17/11/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, if you are available now we can proceed with the session now also, Could you please share if we can start the session now?
17/11/23, 1:07 pm - +265 992 34 99 23: Okay
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265992349923, As you remember that we were talking about the EWYL yesterday in reference with this,  let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265992349923 May I know dear if you are having any difficulty as our session is not going smoothly, If you have any concern please let me know dear.
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tabitha, I hope you are doing well. 

I believe you had a chance to read my previous message, however we haven't received your response. May I please know if you are facing any challenge, please share your response with us?
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tabitha, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to my previous message, I hope you had a chance to go through them however we have not received your response. Considering the same, I would like to know if you are facing any challenges, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
22/11/23, 9:02 am - +265 992 34 99 23: Good morning,
Sorry for not responding to the messages, my phone got lost and my dad is in another area, so there was no other way to keep communication.
I sincerely apologize.

Looking at the admission fee, already I had my worries to say it may happen that I may not be able to reach the deadlines regardless of having to pay in installments. 
Right now, we are experiencing a 44% devaluation which has made things worse for us such that we will not manage to pay the admission fee
