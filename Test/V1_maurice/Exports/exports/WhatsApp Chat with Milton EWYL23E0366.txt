I am good. 
Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.

23/08/23, 9:30 am - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

21/09/23, 2:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents 

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
22/09/23, 1:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
It is time for your session.
26/09/23, 10:18 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I am sorry to inform you that there won't be any session today as I have to attend to some urgent paperwork. Your sessions are rescheduled for tomorrow at the same time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Thank you, and I look forward to our session tomorrow.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
