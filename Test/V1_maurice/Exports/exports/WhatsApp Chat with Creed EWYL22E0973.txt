As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
