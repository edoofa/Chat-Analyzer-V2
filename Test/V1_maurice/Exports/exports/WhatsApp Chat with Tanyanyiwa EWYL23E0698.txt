28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright. I understand.
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
28/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Afternoon.we are ready
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you  can go ahead we are ready
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Thanx for explaining the two goals
28/09/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 344 2930: That is wonderful.Thank you
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Tanyanyiwa*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Tanyanyiwa* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Good afternoon we are ready

29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tanyanyiwa* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you very much.We have gone through the document
29/09/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Tanyanyiwa* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Tanyanyiwa* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
29/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 344 2930: It's fine thank you very much
29/09/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

29/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 344 2930: It is alright thank you so much
19/10/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

31/10/23, 7:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tanyanyiwa and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 344 2930: This orientation is very good and beneficial to the students
07/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 344 2930: To succeed in the EWYL the student should work very hard,be time conscious and should be able to meet deadlines.The student must also be able to strike a balance between his or her academic work and the EWYL
17/11/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Tanyaniyiwa!
Hope you are doing well.
