14/09/23, 3:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Marvellous, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbia, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to Galgotias in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday
📅 28/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
11/10/23, 1:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Marvellous!

Hope you are doing well.

This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled video call session on Saturday. I shared the call schedule last week, along with the link, on Friday, and I expected your participation. I understand that life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges, and I'd appreciate it if you could kindly share the reason for your absence during the call. Your input is valuable to us, and we want to ensure we address any concerns or issues you might have.

16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:39 am - +260 97 9023317: Alright so 
All the form I shared with you 
You still have them ?

20/10/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Certainly, a student's eligibility for a 100% scholarship is contingent on several key factors. These factors include the quality of their Statement of Purpose (SoP), academic performance, engagement in extracurricular activities, any relevant work experiences, the strength of recommendation letters, and their responses during counseling sessions. The combination of these elements often plays a crucial role in determining whether a student qualifies for a full scholarship.
20/10/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: The forms that you gave after the $300 plan?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
