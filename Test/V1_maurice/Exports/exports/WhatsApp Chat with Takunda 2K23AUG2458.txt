13/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

However, I did not receive a response from your end. Please let me know if you have received my message so that we can proceed and complete our session for the admission process.

16/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Takunda.

How are you doing this lovely evening?
17/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takunda,

Over the past couple of weeks, we at Edoofa have been waiting for you to connect with the admissions team and move forward with your university admission journey. However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to get a response from your end as there has been repeated delays from your side.

We do understand that you might have your reasons because of which you were not able to connect or share an update regarding the challenges. However, your absence has left a negative impression on your scholarship application file, which could result in missing out on your scholarship opportunity.

Hence, the academic board urged us to reach out to you once again and give you an opportunity to transparently share the concerns you have because of which you have not been connecting with the team, so that the relevant solutions can be shared with you.
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 552 5168: Good evening sir these past weeks I have been working at a mine, this is a small scale mine which is in the bush the problem I'm facing here is lack of network like what I was reporting in another group that I'm pushing so that I get the 150 USD balance being paid by this week so the moment electricity is switched off through loadshedding network goes down so that is the biggest challenge I'm having sir, again Takunda is at school he is writing his fanal exams now he will be free from the 15th of November they are not allowed phones at high school so he is not connected as well
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 552 5168: I'm looking forward to be available on line before end of this week
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 552 5168: On our first days I was always on line because I was in Harare and Takunda was on Holiday he was home we could respond any time so we are pleading for leniency from the body as we are going through these challenges
17/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for reaching out and explaining the situation. We truly appreciate your efforts to keep us informed despite the challenges you're facing with connectivity due to your work in the remote area and Takunda's commitments at school.

We completely understand the difficulties you're encountering with the network and the restrictions imposed by Takunda's school. We value your dedication and commitment towards resolving the situation and ensuring Takunda's education. 

And as it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let us connect tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your family as well.
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 552 5168: At work now sir will be available after work
