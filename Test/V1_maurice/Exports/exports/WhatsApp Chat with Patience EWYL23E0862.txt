1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete.
