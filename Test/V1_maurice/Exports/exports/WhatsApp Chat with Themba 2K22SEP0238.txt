06/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 799 6606: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
06/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you for sharing
06/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would like to inquire if you recall the same?
06/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 799 6606: I had forget
06/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
06/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah I'm ready
06/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
06/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
06/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 799 6606: We clear
06/09/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:
06/09/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
06/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 713 3210: Its clear
06/09/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
06/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 713 3210: So far l had understand the procedure
06/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
06/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 799 6606: @918384048513  from what l have heard before edoofa reduces one's fees from 8000 to 3000 and it is further reduced depending on the percentage of schoolarship edoofa offers you, am l right there
06/09/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Like if one scores 15 points he /she will be given a 100% schoolarship on tuition fee and on accommodation fee they don't give a schoolarship you should pay 1000us per annual if you are living in campus of the school
06/09/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. Although one could increase their scholarship percentage based on the marks they score on their A-level. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this ?
06/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Got you, let's say one is offered 60% schoolarship how much does he/she will have to pay
06/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is a great question. The exact amount of your fees will be mentioned in the offer letter shared by the universities. 

If you are inquiring about how the Scholarship works. If you are offered 60% you will be able to pay the remaining tuition fees after 60% of the total tuition fee has been deducted.
06/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Oky noted
06/09/23, 10:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
07/09/23, 7:31 am - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you same to you
07/09/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Themba , 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michal Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
08/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
08/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Good day Mr shivjeet
How are you doing my parents are having network connection l guess, how are you doing I'm doing great since it's friday, it is a great day indeed
09/09/23, 10:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely afternoon. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
09/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 713 3210: Afternoon sir, yes l am available  for the session
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
09/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 799 6606: Good day mr shivjeet, no l don't know about that
09/09/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
09/09/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
09/09/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure it is
09/09/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
09/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure go ahead with the explanation
09/09/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
09/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Woow that's great l didn't know
09/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Mr shivjeet let's say you complete all the formalities before the mentioned month you say you want to come to India will you be able to come
09/09/23, 12:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a great question with me. The university will share an official announcement for the arrival and the students are required to arrive in batches.
09/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 799 6606: 🤝Ooh that's great
09/09/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as an unforseen work that just came up. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconvene on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
09/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you same to you
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as it was a long weekend and I was occupied with unforeseen work.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Noted
21/09/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 713 3210: Fine sir how are you
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 713 3210: Yes , l am ready sir
21/09/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
21/09/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. Hence, I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 713 3210: By paying $150 l will be able get the chance to go  for the leading universities for my child.l would like that idea
22/09/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session. @263777133210 @263777996606 <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?

18/10/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*

08/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure thing Mr shivjeet
08/11/23, 12:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah l have done so
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure thing
08/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Great
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 799 6606: 1 usd 1000
2  4 years
3  usd 300
4 usd750
08/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is 2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Mr shivjeet the course is 4 year program
08/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, Themba. I have edited my above message for correction. Please go through it again and let me know if it is now correct.
08/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Copy that and for accommodation it's 2500usd annually
08/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Sure
08/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further and hopefully complete our letter discussion in time for today? @263777996606
08/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I noticed that we faced some challenges in maintaining a smooth discussion. I understand that there may have been some difficulties, and as your admission officer, I want to ensure we find the best solution.

To facilitate a more productive and efficient discussion regarding the letter, I would like to inquire about your availability for our session. This will allow us to complete our conversation in a timely and effective manner and avoid potential delay on the offer letter which may get revoked by the university.
08/11/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like to continue and proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

09/11/23, 4:49 am - +263 77 799 6606: And If l choose to stay in a more affordable price of 800 means I will be paying 2800 on tuition and accommodation plus exam fee of 200 and addes upto $3000

09/11/23, 9:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Themba. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session. I am happy that you have shared your concerns and I will be addressing them with the proceeding of the session. 

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you or any of the family members are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Good day Mr shivjeet l have send messages which you didn't respond to
14/11/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Dear Parents and Themba!

I hope you are well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message when you were online, as it was a long weekend here in India, followed by a national holiday—Diwali, also known as the festival of lights.

With that said, today is a special day for us here in India, known as Children’s Day. I wish you a happy Children's Day, and with that said, I am ready to take on today's session and acknowledged all the questions that you have asked and am ready to answer them as along as we proceed with the session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you
14/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 799 6606: How was your diwali
14/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It was great, thank you. How are you and your family doing today?
14/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 799 6606: We doing great thank you
14/11/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: All your above concerns will be cleared as we now proceed with the session. Now, I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
14/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Got you on that
14/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 799 6606: I will be offline for now want to read tomorrow l have an exam
14/11/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are currently nearing the deadline for your offer letter, and it is crucial for us to complete the discussion on time, may I know if your parents/guardians are available to proceed with the session on your behalf?
14/11/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Mr shivjeet if the cost of the university is more than $3000 I'm not going for the university
14/11/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 799 6606: If you find time please do respond to the messages l send to you earlier
14/11/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 799 6606: My parents are entrepreneurs, most of the time they will be busy with work so they won't be responding
15/11/23, 11:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Themba. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I understand that you are curious about the offer letter and, most importantly, the cost of the education that the letter has to offer. However, as we proceed smoothly with the session, the prices and the cost of the education will be well relayed to you in full detail, as that is a major part of this session. As a hint, your cost of education will not exceed $3,000.

Now, from now on, I would like you to be a little patient with me to proceed with the session so that you have a clear understanding about the letter. Please do let me know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Noted we clear
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah I'm clear
15/11/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah we together
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah I would appreciate that
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Got you on that
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 799 6606: I stay in chipinge West
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Got you
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you for the explanations that was understood
15/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Oky
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
15/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my above message? @263777996606
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Got you Mr shivjeet thank you for sharing
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah l have Mr shivjeet
15/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $3000. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Copy that
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 11:49 pm - +263 77 799 6606: No Mr shivjeet
16/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Themba!

18/11/23, 9:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Themba!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
18/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 799 6606: I'm good thank you for asking, as a family we had a brief look and discussed about my future on how I'm going to live in India for the next 4 years making those massive amount of money and from the discussion l discovered that my parents had believed that having an schoolarship means one has to pay nothing and if he/she need to pay the amount won't be high, so this issue is still under discussion as they will be deciding if they will be affording to pay for the fee inoder for me to come to india
18/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 799 6606: In our conversation we had a brief look at fees of universities in our surrounding countries and the cost per year adds upto 3000 with all accommodation and food and they are offering medicine which is my first priority and in India for international students inorder for one to do medicine one should be doing 4 subjects needed by the university which we don't usually take here in Zimbabwe
18/11/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your family's discussion regarding the offer letter. It's great to hear that you've engaged in conversations about your future education. Your parents' concerns are valid, and it's essential to have a clear understanding of the financial aspects involved in pursuing education abroad.
18/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have also mentioned here you have found the Medical option. May I know if you were able to finalize on the university that is offering you this option?
18/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 799 6606: So all these conversations and thoughts on how my future lies is being decided they will send there responds if they are still willing for me to take my degree in India or not

18/11/23, 12:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to a Medical Degree in India ?
18/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yes sure Mr shivjeet
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm curious about your interest in pursuing Medicine, especially considering your initial choice of Mechanical Engineering. These courses seem unrelated, which raises our concern. Could you share more about this shift in interest?
18/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 799 6606: I had a chart with some of my friends who is doing there studies in zambia and others in India  and asked if one is able to get a job in India after getting there degree and most of there responds was no
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 799 6606: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 799 6606: This makes me more scared of coming to India and after my degree is over l get back home and employment for mechanical engineers in our country is unreliable
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 799 6606: And l heard this in mind that  if l go and do medicine where one of my cousin brother is pursing his degree it won't be scary for me getting a job since l will be following his path and he is following his father's path as he is a doctor in Namibia
18/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Mr shivjeet is there any mechanical engineer who is currently working in India or anywhere whom you have assisted to get a job if l may  ask since from the past discussions l heard that mechanical engineering is a fruitful employment and it's demanding
18/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 799 6606: From my research so far the most countries with needed mechanical engineers is Germany, Poland, USA, China
18/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I see Themba and I appreciate your concerns and the insights you have gathered from your friends studying in Zambia and India. I understand that job prospects post-graduation are a significant consideration and this is something we at Edoofa value the most and this is where your EWYL session comes into place.

To help you here, let me share some insights into the Mechanical Engineering job opportunities in India. India has a rapidly growing industrial sector, and the demand for skilled mechanical engineers is substantial. Various industries, including automotive, aerospace, energy, and manufacturing, actively seek mechanical engineering talent and if you research for the same through the right sources, I am certain this is what you will get. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Many reputable companies in India regularly hire mechanical engineers, offering diverse roles and opportunities for growth. The country's emphasis on technological advancements and infrastructure development contributes to a thriving job market for engineering professionals.

While it's true that certain countries may have a high demand for mechanical engineers, India, with its booming industrial landscape, provides a conducive environment for meaningful career prospects.
18/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Additionally, the assistance from Edoofa extends beyond academic support, and we have successfully helped students secure employment opportunities as well. If you wish, I can help you connect with individuals who are currently in India and are pursuing their education in the same field. This can offer you firsthand insights into their experiences and career paths.

However, from what I have inferred from our conversation, your major concern lies with the course you have chosen since it seems like you are now inclined towards the field of Medical Science? Am I understanding you well here?
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me here today I really appreciate your honesty.  It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session with your concerns my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>

21/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Good afternoon team edoofa, how are you doing today, here we are all still breathing indicating we are fine, from our previous session my last message was of me discussing with my family if l should continue my journey of going to study abroad and our final decision was l will not continue with my journey of going to study abroad due to serious measures which were considered on how my life is going to be after 4 years based on how our business is coming so far
22/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Themba. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

Thank you for sharing your decision with me, and I appreciate your careful consideration. Your priorities and family's well-being are essential aspects to consider when making such significant choices. I would like to help you on it. However, for that, I noticed that the concerns that you shared were for the mechanical engineering and wanting to pursue a medical degree, and I believe I have elaborated on the issue for the same. Hence, I would like to ask, the next concern is about your future in the next 4 years due to serious measures on the business front. In light of that, may I know if you could come clear with me here and provide me with further clarification?
22/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 799 6606: I'm good thank you for contacting, thank you for understanding my situation as l was saying my parents business is not so much stable as before, there was some issues concerning our family which drain most of the money in our business and this worries us the most that what if the kind of situation arises when l am far away from home this may affect my higher education while I'm abroad
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 799 6606: So my family has decided to send me to Zambia, the prices over there ranges 1000-1500usd per year which is much affordable
22/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the concern regarding stability and financial situations affecting your education. It's important to prioritize stability during your educational journey. Despite Zambia offering you these amounts may I know if you were able to secure a position at the universities?
22/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Not yet I'm still working on it
22/11/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I that case, may I know if you have made any back up plans for the same?
22/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Yeah we working on it
22/11/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It appears that you have not yet made a plan for your higher education, and I would like to ask: what will be the case if you fail to secure the same ?
22/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 799 6606: 1500usd is money both my parents  can raise since it's note needed once unlike coming to India you will need 1000+ from the start involving tickets for the aeroplane
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Understanding the financial aspect is crucial, and it's positive that Zambia seems more feasible in terms of immediate expenses. However, have you considered potential scholarship opportunities or financial aid programs available in Zambia that might further ease the financial burden for your higher education?
22/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 799 6606: In zambia there is no schoolarship and its even more cheap than in my home country
22/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 799 6606: My acceptance letter into the university will be ready by tomorrow
22/11/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, may I know if you would be able to share the letter by tomorrow?
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 799 6606: If may l ask what do you want to do with acceptance letter
22/11/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As your admission officer, I would like to ensure that your higher education is secured, dear. That is the sole purpose I am here for, to assist you.
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Oky got you Mr shivjeet that's appreciated
22/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to have your understanding, and I appreciate your cooperation, Themba.  Have a great day!
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 799 6606: Thank you as to you
