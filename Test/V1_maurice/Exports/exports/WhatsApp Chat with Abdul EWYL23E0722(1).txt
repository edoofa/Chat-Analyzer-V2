11/10/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Noted,
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Abdul, I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: No it's not like that, we are have netwrok challenges, its not stable
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Strugling to download this video due to network
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Abdul is currently at school, am his parent who you interacting with,
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you for letting me know.
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand.
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you as you have joined our group for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 430 1947: My Name is Petros Rachiti, Abdul-Saeed's father,
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Nice to meet you sir!
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Thank you
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Noted, will advise th2 school to afford him time for rhe sessions

12/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with our discussions.
12/10/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Abdul* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
12/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Oky maam

12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Abdul*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Abdul* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Noted
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Abdul* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
12/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Oky
12/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Please go through it and once done let me know.
12/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *2:00 PM to 3:00 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
12/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely having this session with you, and I am looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Ms Aditi my I ask a question
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 039 4189: May*

After that, you were contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you to fund your higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build your personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
13/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Noted
