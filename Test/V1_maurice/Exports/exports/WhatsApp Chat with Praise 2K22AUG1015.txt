However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Praise’s higher education?

23/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes i am available now.
23/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes i do recall the process
23/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay Ma'am.

So a statement of purpose has to be provided so that i can counseled on university admission and if that is all done i will receive offer letter from universities which are would have applied to and then register and receive acceptance letter and the visa application process commences
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Thank you Ma'am. I would like to ask if there are any fees or money needed during the registration process.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we have a detailed discussion about it now as we move ahead with step 3.
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay Ma'am thank you.
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes that's correct Ma'am.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am.
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Following..
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Oh okay Ma'am.
23/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 711 2340: So $500to$750 is the range of the fee?
25/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 711 2340: Good morning Ma'am.
25/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Praise.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for connecting with you yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.
25/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, we can connect now, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Praise,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
26/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Good day Ma'am
26/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Sry for the late response we are facing challenges in network connection Ma'am
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand the challenges you're facing with electricity and network issues may I know if you are comfortable to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am I understand
27/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am understandable
27/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 711 2340: So far it's all clear thank you for the clarity
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 711 2340: You can provide more information, i am so aware of the process
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
27/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay okay i now understand it.
27/10/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 711 2340: That's very true
27/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 711 2340: It will be very difficult for one to pursue a bachelor's education
27/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Praise,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 6:20 am - +263 71 711 2340: Good morning Ma'am. We apologize we were having network challenges
30/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Yes Ma'am a good afternoon to yu
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Unfortunately Praise might be in her exams so she might not be in touch
30/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, you as parents can connect on her behalf please.
30/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Yu are most welcome
30/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
30/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Yes Ma'am so far all is  clear
30/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Yaaa on this one Ma'am we can just take it as a discussion bt my daughter Praise will sail through on her sitting right away
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 949 6482: She wont sit twice i promise
30/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am sure she will.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Thats great
30/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Good news indeed
30/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 949 6482: As a parent i want her to pursue to the the furtherst in as much as she want to
30/10/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 949 6482: As much as i live by the grace of God Ma'am i will make sure costs are met cz i indeed want my daughter to achieve what we failed,,like i myself am not educated so she must
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you are willing to do whatever it takes for your daughter. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 949 6482: Wish you a best day too Ma'am regards to the whole God driven team too

15/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Good afternoon Ma'am.
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Praise,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Thank you so much.
15/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am I did go through the letter
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Sure Ma'am
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 711 2340: 1)$900
2)4 years (8 semesters) 
3)$300

About the registration fee which one is it Ma'am?
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your response, let me help you with the 4th question, please refer to the page 2 of the offer letter.
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay Ma'am thank you for your assistance it's $ 750
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am that's correct
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 711 2340: So this means that I will be graduating in September 2028?
15/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 711 2340: And again Ma'am, that means that is the final scholarship percentage and final A level results will not determine anything?
15/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you will be graduating in August 2028 since your course is for 4 years. Let me help you understand your query here, if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
15/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay sure Ma'am. That's clear now. Thank you.
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 711 2340: So this amount if for the whole year?
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Praise,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Good afternoon Ma'am.
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay Ma'am understood
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 711 2340: I apologize for the late response Ma'am. I have been having network challenges.
16/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that the network can be a challenge, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes i am now available Ma'am
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
16/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes Ma'am. But I wanted to ask Ma'am,after i graduate is the certificate international, will it allow me to work anywhere?
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please @263717112340 the degrees are internationally recognized.
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay Ma'am understood, thank you so much
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 711 2340: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 711 2340: I'm clear with this one Ma'am.
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 711 2340: So the $750 is supposed to be paid by 28 November?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 711 2340: What if you do not happen to have it by 28 November Ma'am?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you understand better. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 711 2340: You can explain Maa
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 711 2340: *Ma'am.
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Ooh okay understood.
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Yes I'm in Harare
16/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Okay i don't have that one
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 3:58 am - +263 71 711 2340: Good morning Ma'am. Thank you.

17/11/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday that is 20th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 711 2340: Oky Ma'am thank you
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
21/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Praise,

It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
