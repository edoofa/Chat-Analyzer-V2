29/09/23, 1:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Naomi,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Saloni your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Saloni's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 407 8479: I pray you get well soon
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: Thank you so much.

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

20/11/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Naomi,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Tuesday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for tomorrow's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the EWYL Group starting tomorrow. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it removes the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting tomorrow, our sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, on the EWYL Group. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
