02/08/23, 12:13 am - +263 77 924 5194: Help ma'am ,we are not having a break this tym because of our upcoming exams but they will be over by 15 November

03/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 924 5194: Thank you for understanding
18/09/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 924 5194: Morning Ms Ananya ,
I very much understand what you are trying to say and I am considering taking option 1 so that we can move forward
18/09/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that NAME will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
18/09/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I have gone through it
18/09/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, let us connect in our next session. See you!
18/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Thank u
19/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Good afternoon
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes m ready good afternoon
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Diana can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes we are
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
19/09/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
19/09/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok so at the moment I am standing in for Diana so on the name will I write Diana's name
19/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, @263772580809
19/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok noted
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Diana’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring Diana closer to reaching her career goals.

As per our discussion, Diana will resume his EWYL Process on 15 November. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok so meaning we will contact you on the EWYL line as from the 15 of November?
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Will definitely do so
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, however, I would want you to kindly drop that message on the EWYL to help keep a track.
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Noted thanks
24/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 258 0809: This message was deleted

19/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Good afternoon I noted that stress comes as a survival mechanism from a stressor

I will be waiting for this!🚀
31/10/23, 6:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Diana

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Diana and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Thank you for the update 
Personally I think the key factors  to succeed are commitment and dedication towards the program and also one should have a vision and focus
14/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Diana!

I hope this message finds you well. I trust your exams went smoothly. Congratulations on completing this phase!

Now that the exams are over, it's time to resume our mentoring sessions. I would like to hear about your exam experiences and discuss your progress. Your dedication during exam preparations is commendable.

20/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Diana!

How are you doing today? You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I was thinking that we are already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting on a daily basis in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 8:30 am in the morning in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey!
