*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

04/10/23, 12:14 pm - +260 96 9697706: Here
04/10/23, 12:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Taonga. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
09/10/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Taonga_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*
*2. We'll also connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp for more accessible interactions in sessions.*
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss.
09/10/23, 4:11 pm - +260 96 9697706: It's clear
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability.
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes I am
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes I do
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 96 9697706: We are
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 3:47 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes it does
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - +260 96 9697706: I don't think I can do it by tomorrow
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: But you have to submit the video by 13th.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - +260 96 9697706: I will
21/10/23, 6:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Taonga

Let's make this session unforgettable!
25/10/23, 10:47 am - +260 96 9697706: Alright thank-you 
I'll be there
25/10/23, 3:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now could you share the names of your 5 acquaintances who are currently in Africa, at either U5 or U6, and are available to help you with the contacts?

Write down their names along with their class. Don’t write the names of people who have already completed their A Level.
25/10/23, 3:22 pm - +260 96 9697706: Could you explain the u5 and you u6 I don't understand

25/10/23, 4:05 pm - +260 96 9697706: Kalumbu Musonda- g12
Chikatizyo Elisha-g12
25/10/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering that all of them are still actively enrolled in school, my suggestion is for you to get in touch with them and kindly request them to add you to their unofficial class groups. 

I'll be listing the names of your friends in the description box of this group "EWYL GROUP," and once they've included you in their unofficial groups, you can make the necessary edit in the description box by adding "Added" in front of their names. 

Is this explanation perfectly clear?
25/10/23, 4:10 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes it is
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have we touched upon the topic of the video that you're expected to create, which revolves around your personal journey?
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Well, the deadline has already passed, and now I'd like you to prioritize completing this task. Your objective is to create a 2-3 minute video where you share your personal journey with a student who is currently at home. In this video, cover all the essential points that you believe a student should be aware of before they proceed with filling out the student application form.
I want you to make the video and submit it to me by Tomorrow. Is that okay?
25/10/23, 4:17 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regrettably, it's time to bring our conversation to a close, and I do wish we could have extended it further. However, we're set to reconvene on Saturday, which falls on November 4th, 2023. Please ensure you don't miss this important date.


Moreover, if you ever feel the need to discuss anything, feel free to drop me a message here in your EWYL GROUP.
25/10/23, 4:33 pm - +260 96 9697706: Alright thank you
27/10/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Evening Taonga*_
I was expecting a response from you but looks like you have been really busy lately. Is everything alright? 

It's been some time since we last talked about the video, and the deadline has come and gone. *I'd like you to give top priority to the video now*. If you encounter any challenges, please don't hesitate to discuss them with me.
