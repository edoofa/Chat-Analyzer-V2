22/08/23, 1:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am thrilled to be your mentor.  Before connecting with you today, I  reviewed your applications and gathered feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/08/23, 1:08 pm - +260 97 6786186: Am supper excited as well
22/08/23, 1:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share a short clip about myself.
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
22/08/23, 1:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 6786186: Thankx so much. Supper excited to begin this journey and hopeful that it will be the best decision ever with your mentorship and guidance.
22/08/23, 1:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
22/08/23, 1:19 pm - +260 97 6786186: Yes I did
23/08/23, 4:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 8:30am to 9:30 am (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.

It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
23/08/23, 10:27 pm - +260 97 6786186: Good evening. Sorry just seen the message. I have gone through the message and will be on time tomorrow
24/08/23, 7:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?
24/08/23, 8:00 am - +260 97 6786186: Good morning
24/08/23, 8:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/08/23, 8:37 am - +260 97 6786186: Am not familiar with the objectives
24/08/23, 8:38 am - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 6786186: Following and understood
24/08/23, 8:50 am - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/08/23, 8:52 am - +260 97 6786186: Noted
24/08/23, 8:53 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Luyando?
24/08/23, 8:54 am - +260 97 6786186: Sounds great and I pledge to give it my all so I can achieve the most and best from the program
24/08/23, 8:55 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/08/23, 8:59 am - +260 97 6786186: Great
24/08/23, 8:59 am - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/08/23, 8:59 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 6786186: Done
24/08/23, 9:26 am - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 6786186: The whole newsletter is good but what like the most is where it said breaking a larger goal into smaller ones so that ones success is monitored
24/08/23, 9:30 am - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/08/23, 9:31 am - +260 97 6786186: That  would  be  great
24/08/23, 9:35 am - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
24/08/23, 9:36 am - +260 97 6786186: Yes I am
24/08/23, 9:44 am - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
24/08/23, 10:06 am - +260 97 6786186: 1. On my Edoofa EWYL team I have Ms. Tenzin as my mentor, Ms. Deepali as Head of Department and Ms. Davi as head coach.
2. Her goals to ensure that all Edoofans have equal opportunities to develop their skills and to help all Edoofans self finance their education. 
3. Newsletter. 
4. This is a recognition of past Edoofans who have achieved their goals from the program and their declarations of the help and support that the program rendered to them in order to reach their goals

29/08/23, 10:40 am - +260 97 6786186: Sorry we had electricity issues from last night so my phone was charging

29/08/23, 11:25 am - +260 97 6786186: Today's audio was about Community building a process of establishing and strengthening connections/relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. 
Community building creates a supportive and conducive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to communicate and collaborate in working towards a common goal.
The main goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success. 
Students must develop social networking and persuasive skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join the Edoofan education equal system and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. 
Students must reach out and extend to their personal and social networks and identify youths who are looking to create careers and direct them towards this opportunity. 
Students are to reach out to youths who have just completed their education or are in their final year and explain the Edoffan opportunities. 
At the end of the day any successful sign up gets rewards for the student who referred them
29/08/23, 12:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.

31/08/23, 8:37 am - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
31/08/23, 8:39 am - +260 97 6786186: Following
31/08/23, 8:43 am - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
31/08/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 6786186: Noted
01/09/23, 8:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
We will start the session at 9:00 am today.
01/09/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 6786186: Good morning
01/09/23, 8:57 am - +91 78273 08969: Let us begin our session.
01/09/23, 9:17 am - +260 97 6786186: Morning
01/09/23, 9:19 am - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

01/09/23, 3:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

04/09/23, 8:33 am - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

04/09/23, 8:34 am - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
