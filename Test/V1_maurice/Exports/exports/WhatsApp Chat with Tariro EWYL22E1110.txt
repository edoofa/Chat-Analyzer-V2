I hope you all are in great health and spirits. Since you were not able to attend/complete the last Grant Session, I have scheduled one other session for the Grant discussion. 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 24-08-2023 at -
_*2:30 pm (Zimb time) / 6:00 pm (Indian Time)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want you to read the Grant Letter that was shared with me along with the FAQ document. Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
*No more sessions will be held after this.*
24/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Okay thank you very much.I will be available
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 294 2467: I understood that the Grant price comes with it's own rules and regulations. Inorder to keep the acquired Grant one must adhere to certain rules and challenges
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Sorry regulations
24/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 294 2467: An EDOOFIAN should ne able to follow those rules as it shows a certain level of dedication
24/08/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Yess I'm ready
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 294 2467: It also puts students in a position to challenge themselves and do their best in everything they do
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Yes I'm very much aware
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Thank you very much. I'll work very hard in the future too
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Thank you very much. I feel motivated
24/08/23, 2:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win. <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 294 2467: They were more than happy and even more excited for this Grant challenge. For now they're a bit busy that's why they are not online. But I'm sure as soon as they are online they will reply. I will submit the form soon
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 294 2467: I understand all the rules and regulations that vome with the Edoofa Grant
24/08/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

01/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I didn't know the time for our session. I got caught up at the bank trying to open an account. If possible may we please have the session tommorow
08/11/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Tariro*

I hope you're doing well. I realize that it's been some time since we last communicated. We've been on the road, visiting various partner universities for the initial orientation event.

Now that we've completed our visits to nearly all the universities, I'm back in touch with you. Tariro, I trust you recall the discussion you had with *Mr. Sagar*, which has hopefully provided you with more clarity.

I want to bring to your attention that a significant amount of time has passed since the video submission deadline. Please ensure that you complete this task by the end of today.
08/11/23, 1:31 pm - +91 78892 32272: Greetings to you too Ms Jasmine. Hope you are doing well. Okay I will submit the video
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Evening Tariro*_
I hope you're doing wonderfully. It's time to kickstart our journey back into the world of Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday Activities. 🚀 Today, being Wednesday, I've got a golden nugget of wisdom to share, and I'm super excited to hear your thoughts on it. 🤓💬 

*Kindly dive into the content below and share your insights right here in the EWYL GROUP by tomorrow.*
Happy reading! 📚😄👍
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm also very excited. I had missed all the lessons and knowledge that I get from the Wednesday wisdom
08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: I have understood that Diwali marks the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. It is observed on the new moon night. It encourages individuals to cultivate knowledge and wisdom. Lighting of the dayas helps in enlightening souls and also thus urging spiritual growth. Here this side there are lights all over. This is very exciting as I have been looking forward to Diwali. I'll also get a chance to experience the same feeling.
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: Happy Diwali to you Ms Jasmine🫂❤️
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - +91 78892 32272: I had a wonderful session with Mr Saga and I am looking forward to more exciting sessions with him. Thank you very much Ms Jasmine for always mentoring me and being there for me. I will always work hard and do my best for my EWYL

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.
*How was your first Diwali here in India Tariro?*
14/11/23, 9:44 am - +91 78892 32272: It was okay. Though I didn't have a chance to participate in any of the activities, I enjoyed. How was yours?. Hope you also enjoyed
14/11/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: My Diwali was vibrant and full of colors. We adorned our home, created beautiful rangoli designs, and indulged in a variety of delicious sweets.
14/11/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Why didn't you participate in any activities Tariro?
14/11/23, 10:04 am - +91 78892 32272: Most India students went back to their homes and even the teachers and staff members. So only a few people were left. I couldn't even understand what they were doing at times. But i loved the lighting and fireworks though
14/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I wanted to bring to your attention that we couldn't meet this past Saturday due to Diwali preparations. To catch up, I was hoping we could schedule a *video call today at 6:30 pm.* Does that time work for you?

*Here is the call link* 📲

Make sure you are on time. ⌚
14/11/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so happy to see that you have learned so much Tariro
14/11/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes definitely❤️
14/11/23, 10:56 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the update. I will attend on time
15/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tariro, 
I hope you are in great spirits. 

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪
15/11/23, 9:51 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the reminder. I'll be available for the session
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Evening Tariro,_*
How are you doing?

It's time for the session
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78892 32272: Greetings mam. I'm sorry I'm late for the session. Can you please add me
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78892 32272: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, we have a session here in the group.
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 78892 32272: I thought we were having a group call
15/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78892 32272: I hope you had a great day today
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Quick flashback to our chat yesterday about the training document. Were you able to go through the document?
15/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes i went through the document. And basing on the information after training, the student should only be able to aim and focus more with students who are well focused and have potential. You should choose someone who has interest or will not dissapoint later on.
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You know the purpose of conducting this training holds great significance. I am confident that you understand the importance of this plan. Training is a crucial step to ensure that you can derive the maximum benefits from it. Upon completing the training, you will be recognized as a student leader, and you will be responsible for your own application forms.

Does that make sense to you?
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes it does. One should be able to recognise potential in other students or even mould others until they understand the importance of certain things in life
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now let's delve into what your specific responsibilities will be as a *STUDENT LEADER* once the training has been completed.

▪️ Step 1: Contact and reach out to the prospective students.
▪️ Step 2: Educate them about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
▪️ Step 3: Ask them some questions to see if they qualify.
▪️ Step 4: If they qualify, share the Offline Application form with them.
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the enlightenment
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 78892 32272: So one has to be sure about what he or she does because as a student leader every action you make matters
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You can start working on this after the session and make sure you submit the questions by tomorrow.
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes it's clear thank you
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 78892 32272: How many questions do l have to make
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 5 Tariro
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay I'll definitely work on the questions
15/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 78892 32272: I think you should highlight on what exactly is Edoofa. And the benefits of Edoofa. I think the fact that I'm also a beneficiary and that I'm already in India can also be an advantage to convince students. Most importantly you should emphasize that it is not a fully funded scholarship but can be according to the merits you earn and how good you are.
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: ▪️Start by introducing yourself, and providing your own introduction.

▪️After the introduction, explain the Edoofa Scholarship program.

▪️Describe the application process for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

▪️Highlight the reasons for choosing Edoofa over other organizations.

▪️Emphasize what makes the Edoofa Scholarship Program unique.

▪️Discuss why India is considered a dream destination for education.
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for enlightening me more
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm sorry for the response. I was facing some network challenges
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's regrettable that we couldn't finish our session today. We'll reconvene next week for our group call to resume the training.

Wishing you a good night and looking forward to our session next week.
Take care!
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you very much. Same to you
