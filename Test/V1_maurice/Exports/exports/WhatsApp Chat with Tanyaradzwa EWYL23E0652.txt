3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

so as l read on the guide there are a few factors that are mentioned that l have to follow...like l will have to look at the nature of the company,scale of the company, company's financial stability, founders background......then there are 6 steps mentioned that are to be taken into consideration like the first step is to *search* for companies especially startups or those of new enterprenuers and once l have those companies the second step is to study more about those companies in detail,then after that l will have to study the company's website and after that l will have to also look at it's social media pages and see if they are active,then study the founders background,goals, qualifications and all what a view,then lastly l will have to interact with the selected companies by sending them invites and all that.

06/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
06/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 490 4026: that's good to hear

06/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, I talk about LinkedIn, You can type Education in the search bar once you open it.
Not just this, on Google, you can simply type, ‘Small scale Educational companies in African countries
After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.

07/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 490 4026: l will follow that
07/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 490 4026: thank you
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, since our session time is over. Let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time. 🌟
08/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 490 4026: so when l get them l will have to contact you
09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Good evening,_

09/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 490 4026: afternoon,how are you Ms Ananya
09/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for aksing, I am doing good.
09/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 490 4026: lam aight.
09/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you were able to find the contact information of your school head?
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes l have them now
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay understood
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 490 4026: definitely yes
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

09/11/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay,thank you

09/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday- 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
09/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
09/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

20/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 490 4026: So it was in 2021 when l had finished writing my A level and was waiting for my results,not sure whether l passed or not.So my dream ever since l was a kid was to make it in life,tue most thing l am scared of is failing in life because if l do so l have not only failed as an individual but that failure also affects other people in my chain which includes my family,my future family,friends and all of those people that may be dependent on me.

So when the results came out l was not very happy with them since they couldn't qualify me to do any course of my interest which outraged one other thing l never like where my parents came in to decide for me now to do things that were not of my interest,they all wanted me to persue engineering courses  and every single day l prayed to God to perve my way to lead me to the things of my interest.

2022 ended and l had given up on going to University and just do as they all want because the issue now was out of hand and age along side was catching up with me having no career for a man is defined by what he knows best,l had decided to just go along with what they wanted,l had given up on all my prayers but this year in 2023 just chilling around with my friends discussing such issues one of the guys told me about Edoofa and he even said he is going the same year .l went home looked Edoofa on the Google and every social platform just to confirm before l applied and its a testimony since my journey so far with Edoofa is going smoothly and well enough that l am even  going to India for my University and in the same field that l've always wanted(enterprenuership)
