This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
25/10/23, 11:26 am - +27 81 750 2657: Okay noted with thanks. I am already currently in 2 groups are these two the ones or there will be other ones
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @27817502657 This is the admission group, you will be added in the EWYL group later. <This message was edited>

25/10/23, 12:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 Thank you for the confirmation. I am sharing the joining link with you, as I believe the numbers are private. Please share the link with your parents and do let me know once they are added in the group. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/EC5qIZsdcUmFGuufNE058P
25/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with Aaron's counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into his academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch his career. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about his counseling session with the counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - +27 81 750 2657: From the sessions we had so far. We are impressed to know that Aarons scholarship has a EWYL oppotunity, which is meant to equip him into a resourcesful graduate at the end of his degree by providing him some work expirience before hand. Also with a chance of attaining a 100% scholarship depending with the points he is going to earn in the process. This will impact a lot on the total amount which will be expected from us parents. Meaning he will be able to self finance.
25/10/23, 1:00 pm - +27 81 750 2657: We also understood that the programme is meant to produce industry ready candidates and it is to my best interest that after finishing his course he will be able to find work on an international stage.
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm truly delighted to hear that @27817502657. The EWYL program that aims to provide valuable work experience during his degree. This also lead to a potential which could significantly impact the financial burden. This, in turn, would empower him to become more self-reliant.
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

26/10/23, 2:53 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Well there is no problem and its very understandable Sir
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/10/23, 2:56 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes the last two parts are also clear. I can see this is a clear pathway which we are going to follow and its very critical for us to follow through until everything is completed.
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes we can start. I think i have understood.
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/10/23, 3:05 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes you can send the videos  . But i would also want Aaron to watch them before we move to the next steps and he must also give his feed back
26/10/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27817502657. I am sharing the videos with you, I am sure Aaron will gain some amazing insight from them.

Hence I would like to know by when do you think he will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly? <This message was edited>

28/10/23, 9:37 am - +27 61 139 7091: Morning sir, the principal of my school notify me this morning and fetch me to another school to have physics and maths clases
28/10/23, 10:13 am - +27 61 139 7091: So l don't think I will be able to complete the questions you sent me  yesterday
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Good day Ashi, Like i explained in the Audio Aaron is busy with his English exam i cant get through to him yet. As soon as he is done he will be sending to you both documents. I understand this is for the student to answer not the parent. Isnt it?
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Its ok. Thank you
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 8:32 pm - +27 61 139 7091: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 6:29 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Good
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 6:37 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
31/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 6:45 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 6:48 pm - +27 61 139 7091: No , am okay
31/10/23, 6:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 6:49 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
31/10/23, 6:54 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Good
31/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27611397091, Have a Blessed day ahead and please extends our warm regards to your family.

Let me explain this point to you, I hope you remember our previous conversation regarding the registration fees that to secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, known as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $100. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.

However, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I hope you understand?
22/11/23, 11:53 am - +27 81 750 2657: Hello Ashi, thank you for elaborating on this. We have understood. We can proceed with our session
22/11/23, 11:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27817502657, I am glad to know that you are ready for the session.
