01/08/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Ready
01/08/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Done let's proceed
01/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes they are clear we can continue
01/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Are you still online?
01/08/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding.  Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes we are following let's proceed
01/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes very clear thank you
01/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Ok we can proceed
01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
01/08/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Ok thank you can I take time to watch the videos tomorow then we can continue with the session on Thursday if that's ok with you
01/08/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 355 0014: I will be at school during the day so I will be free after school to watch the videos
01/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand, however, the videos take only 30 minutes. So can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 09.00 PM?
01/08/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Very well then will try to meet the deadline so tomorrow 09.00PM it is
01/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 PM.
01/08/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Thank you
01/08/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
02/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Good evening .l have gone through the videos and my understanding is that   
The program does not only help students to get admitted to a school but help them have some other skills other than knowledge like interview technics , Also the Edoofa program have studied the schools for a long time that they know which are the best schools for the edoofian , It gives us scholarship and makes them affordable, Edoofa also stays with you for the coarse of your academic life, I also understand that I have to be committed when I get my scholarship so that I can be successful in my studies .
02/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
02/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
02/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
02/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Thank you for making it more clearer
02/08/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
02/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Following
02/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
02/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

04/08/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
04/08/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
04/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Good afternoon thank you very much for your guidance
04/08/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
04/08/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes that is correct
04/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
04/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes
04/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
04/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
04/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Ok so that means I will have to choose on which offer to take and l hope Edoofa will assist in me in choosing
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed we will assist you. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
04/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes that's correct it was discussed
04/08/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
04/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes quite clear
04/08/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
04/08/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Yes it is clear
04/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Following
04/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
04/08/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Not really but wanted to ask about the selection process .I want to know that how long does it take for universities to do the selection and then send offer letters. I also want to know if the registration fee is refundable or non refundable in case my results do meet the expectation of the university
04/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Do not meet the expectation* typing error there
04/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 355 0014: We need to know how much time we have to look for the registration fee
04/08/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you understand. Each university has its own period of time to generate the offer letter, however, almost every university is able to generate the offer letter within a week's time. Now attending to your second query specifically, if you have read about the refund policy if we as an organization fail to provide you with the scholarship offer then only you are eligible for the refund, and that has never been the case, also your counselor has a done an eligibility test and after considering your results, they found you eligible, so please do not worry about that.
04/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Noted. What time is given to choose your university of choice
04/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773550014 please I would appreciate you to be patient as each and everything will be explained to you once your registration process starts. Since your intake is in 2024, we will start your registration process after August 2023.
04/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Ok noted thank you so much
04/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 355 0014: Very well then thank you

18/10/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

18/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 328 6917: For now I have no questions thank you
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thank you so much we are so excited to hear the good news .lm happy to become a proud edoofian
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Great benefits there.we may proceed
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tafadzwa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 328 6917: That's so great thank you so much
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 328 6917: That's clear
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Well understood thank you
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Its all clear no questions
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 328 6917: You may clarify it further for me
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes its now clear thank you
18/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 328 6917: That's correct
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes I do agree
18/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Its clear
18/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Its clear
18/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted
18/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 328 6917: No queries. Thank you
18/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Tafadzwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tafadzwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please
18/10/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

08/11/23, 6:02 am - +263 77 328 6917: How are you today?

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

I am glad to hear that you are happy and you are most welcome. I am looking forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm today.
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasi
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted and thank you. Yes there are some issues we need clarity.
17/11/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 328 6917: That's fine we can proceed
17/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 328 6917: 1. Tuition fee $1225
2. Hostel fee $1200
3. Registration fee $750
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
17/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted you can proceed
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted you can proceed
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that Tafadzwa will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
17/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes we are together. You can proceed
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1225and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Clear. We can proceed
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how [name] can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Well understood.
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837 and $838, with a six-month gap between them.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before Tafadzwa's arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted. We can proceed
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes we are together
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted but can you please explain further on this issue
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thank you thats now clear to us
17/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 328 6917: No. We are in Chiredzi
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thank you. Cant you use a VISA card for payment if you do have it
17/11/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible on that note, if you wish to make the payment using your Card, then, in that case, you can use either of the two methods. Transfer charges through both the modes ar 10%.

1. Using PayPal
2. By Direct Payment through Edoofa's Website (Available at www.edoofa.com)
17/11/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please
17/11/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/11/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thank you. So if I opt to pay registration fee using my VISA card then i go to your website right
17/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct.
17/11/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted with thanks
17/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please.

1. Is it possible to have  contacts of any Zimbabwean  students at Gulzar.
2. Are there options of changing university after registration fees. Our aim was for Lovely professional university. Probably you can assist on that.
3. Can the scholarship % be reviewed when you receive our childs Alevel results.

20/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please thank you for sharing your concerns, I will get in touch with the team to provide you with a contact of a Zimbabwean student at Gulzar, in the meantime. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
20/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
20/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)

20/11/23, 11:37 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes we are committed in completing the registration process. We have queries we listed  especially on changing of the university. Our plea was to have our son at Lovely Professional University with your assistance.
21/11/23, 12:00 am - +263 77 328 6917: We are going to pay  registration fee in two installments before 30 November and December.
21/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tafadzwa,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please
21/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Good day, we are waiting
21/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay. Now let me attend to your concerns one by one. Coming to your second query. Before I address that could you help me understand what is reason for your inclination towards LPU?
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 328 6917: 1. We find LPU is rated A++
2. That was our first wish from the list of universities you gave us after going through its website and rankings
3. We have also spoke to some of students you made reference to and advised us on that and most of them are from LPU.

3. As such we feel that our child will be better off  studying there and meeting a good number of his fellow country  man
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for stating your reasons, as a Parent I understand where are you coming from. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thank you so much for having this point cleared out to us. We can proceed. So will it be possible to change lets say another university has shown interest in our son after we have made registration fee payments.
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain you even better. At the same time, since you mentioned LPU and it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 328 6917: No we are not aware of the transfer option. Can you school us.
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Noted and thank you
21/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I hope this clarifies your second query?
21/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now coming on to your third query. If you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, with this now for your last query, I would first like to have clarity here, may I know if you meant to say From the service list we did not see medical cover for the child?
21/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes medical cover
21/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand this query as well. While the university provides various facilities, medical expenses are not covered under their purview. To protect international students from these expenses, students are supposed to get Medical Health Insurance.

A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and it is up to the student if they wish to get it from India or their home country, it would cost them around $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this and that this addresses the query you had?
21/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Yes please. Ok.
1. How long are your semester
2. Will they go on internship or attachment in india
21/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please semesters in India are of 6 months as well. Surely let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing his studies in India he will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
21/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
21/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for Tafadzwa is specifically designed so that he as a student is able to learn the 21st-century skills that are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
