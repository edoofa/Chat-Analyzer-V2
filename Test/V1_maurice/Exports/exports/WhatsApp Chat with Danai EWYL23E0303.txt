I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟
