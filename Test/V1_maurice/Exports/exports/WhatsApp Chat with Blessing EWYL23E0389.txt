18/08/23, 2:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
18/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Ok from the audio I heard that the corporate alliance, the one of the three projects that we will carry out us the edoofians . This project will help us to gain and understand of the market  and we will also earn scholarship credits. 
On this project we will identify local companies that deal with technology in our countries and regions. After that we must identify decision makers who work in these companies .
Furthermore we are supposed to create a LinkedIn account if we not yet created it . We will use this LinkedIn account to get in touch with the decision makers of the companies we identified at first. From this LinkedIn I will connect with the managers of thes technology driven companies and gather information about their business like number of their work force, yearly revenue etc. I will also ask these decision makers to connect with the seniors in the Edoofa team
18/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Lastly I also understood that doing these tasks will create a strong professional network  and enhance credibility to me
18/08/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today *Blessing*. 

No session is held on *Saturday and Sunday*


So we will resume our session on monday from 02:00 PM to 03:00 PM. As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be  an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
23/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Am ready
23/08/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
23/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 715 1013: From the document you sent yesterday I heard that since I have been tasked to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to help all students that enroll for Edoofa program, I should consider the nature of the company first, scale of the company :that is the size of work force on that company. It should have from 50 to 200 workers. 
I should also consider the financial position of the company, the company should have good financial position .
Last but not least on the consideration. I should take note of background of the founders. I should choose companies with founders who have experience in their industries and qualifications.
23/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Then steps I should follow include:
Searching: It is the first step of the task where i use sources like Google and LinkedIn .
Step 2 is finding about company's functionality where I as a student I supposed to find about its foundation, area of its expertise etc
23/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 715 1013: After I take these steps I have another important step which I should take which is to study the website of the company and check the various social media pages of the company
23/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 715 1013: I also have to study and understand the background of the founders and other core members. This information can be obtained from LinkedIn
23/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Then after I choose a company which is potential I should start sending invitation messages and request to connect with the managers of these companies
23/08/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You know what , this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
23/08/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

23/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
23/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
23/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
23/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

28/08/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 715 1013: I have listened to the audio and I heard about Community building which the process establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and share the identities among individuals within a particular group or community. 
It involves creating a support even in inclusive environment and individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate and communicate with others. 
The goal of this project is to promote socially interaction and participating . 
The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and participating skills and learn how to leverage the social media and offer students opportunities to join  Edoofa program and acquire international education that prepares them for the future..
By reaching out personally and extend network, students will identify more youth who are looking to create great careers and direct them to the opportunity. 
This project also encourages students to have mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to others. 
To complete this project successfully students are required to reach out to students who have recently graduated from senior secondary school, completing their secondary education. 
Students are required to use networking and persuasion skills to refer other students to the program. 
Edoofa will help and support us on carrying out this project. 
Apart from these benefits on the project, we have the opportunity to get scholarships credits. For every student that enrols in to the Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the
enrolment fee, the student who refer him/her will be get $20 worth of Scholarship credits
Similarly, On the completion of the Admission Formalities of the university, one who refer him will be $30 .

I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
31/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 715 1013: I heard that i have to create a whatsApp and identify the right students to be the participants of the group and add them to the group. 
The goal is to reach out the large number of students and provide them the necessary information about Edoofa before the counseling session, ensuring that they are prepared and have smooth counseling experience. To find the right students I can start by getting in touch with my school mates that currently in form six or those who already passed their form six .
I have to ask my school mates to add me in their  unofficial whatsApp groups . After I joined the unofficial whatsApp group I have to share my group link and tell  students that wish to persue their high education abroad to join my whatsApp group. After students joined my whatsApp group I will start to share information about Edoofa program. 
The main reason of creating a whatsApp group is to be able to share information to a large number of students using less energy. 
In this group that I will share information about the exciting opportunity to persue education in India the scholarship of 50 to 100% on tuition fee . I have to repeat the same process with others divisions as well. 
By doing this I have to spread the information about my group to a minimum of 60 students. Before I interact with the students I have to add Ms Sharda Nayak my mentor to my group .The mentor will track the my progress and provide guidance in  learning networking skills. 
I must address the queries raised by students and discuss them accordingly. 
You my mentor you will be participating in that group but the main reason of adding you is to track information that I will be sharing with the students.
31/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Good afternoon
31/08/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
31/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Am ready Madam
31/08/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
31/08/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: did you go through the audio shared with you?
31/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Yes I did
31/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 715 1013: I heard that i have to create a whatsApp and identify the right students to be the participants of the group and add them to the group.

31/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Blessing, I am impressed with your understanding.
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳.

08/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
08/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Yes Madam
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: are you there?
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 715 1013: Yes I agree
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
11/09/23, 3:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.

Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.

Excuse me for we could not connect yesterday for our session.

Monday was a national holiday in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
