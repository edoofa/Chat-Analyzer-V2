I understand your concern. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could share this matter with the admissions team, as they are the best-equipped to guide you through it.
31/08/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @27832820491 @27676055973 

I hope you are doing well. I have been observing that you are not responding to your EWYL group. I am now worried if everything is fine or not.

So, if there is something you are facing challenges with, share it with me.

I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following article and understand the importance of Excel, and then share a note with me about why you think Excel is important for a student and its various uses.

Lately, I've noticed that some of you haven't been consistently following your EWYL ritual on the EWYL line. I want to stress that this small gesture plays a significant role in maintaining your attendance records and ensuring you receive the full benefits of our program.

So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

09/11/23, 11:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, 

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
