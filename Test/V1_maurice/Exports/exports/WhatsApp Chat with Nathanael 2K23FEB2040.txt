As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024.

04/10/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes I am
04/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

04/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it is, may I know if you are currently available to further proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes I am

So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
04/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes
04/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes it is

05/10/23, 4:02 am - +263 73 566 1031: Good morning. I'm not at home at the moment. I'm out of town. Will be back by Monday 9 October

05/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Good afternoon

May I know if you were able to retrieve the documents?
09/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Good afternoon. Yes I'm at work will send the o level certificate and ID when I get home
09/10/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thak you for letting me know. May I know by when you might be able to share the docuements with me?

17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes I'm through
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Ok that's great
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes it does
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?@263735661031
18/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Understood but is it the case that once finding a place we will be required to pay half of the registration fee within a week?
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It would be 2 weeks. May I know if you are clear?
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes I am
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Ok noted thank you
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Sorry was traveling from work
18/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Please provide information
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Ok. So as of now the scholarship is not 80%
18/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The exact scholarship percentage will be mentioned in the offer letter. However, the minimum starting would be 50%. May I know if you are clear here?
18/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Also with number 1 in mind is it ok if we opt that our son joins the 2025 group not 2024
18/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know why would you like to do that?
18/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes I am clear
18/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 73 566 1031: No I don't want to do that. Just asking if it can be a possibility. Will have to discuss all this with his father especially the payment part and get back to you as soon as possible. Right now he is still at work
18/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will come to that as well. So, in the mean time shall we proceed?
18/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes
18/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 73 566 1031: You mean if they don't do well
18/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes I am
18/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes
18/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Noted
18/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 73 566 1031: No, admissions cost your said they range from $500-$750 less $150 paid by Edoofa. Is that right
18/10/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
18/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Nathanael's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Nathanael is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Yes
18/10/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Nathanael's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 73 566 1031: Thank you

08/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
08/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Ok. Thank you
08/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Ok
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall wait for your reply.
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 554 8429: 1) $900
2) 3 years
3)$300
4) $750
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University - <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Ok
08/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/11/23, 1:48 am - +263 77 554 8429: Noted
09/11/23, 9:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Nathanael. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 554 8429: Good morning. Am a bit busy with work at the moment. Yesterday you had said 8.30 am it's now 0930 and am tied up. Will be free from 1200 now onwards. May we please reschedule
09/11/23, 9:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, we can, shall we connect at your available hour which is from 12:00 PM onwards?
09/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 554 8429: Thank you
09/11/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Hoping to see you at that time of the day.
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are available for the session?
09/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes I am
09/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
09/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes we are together. Will discuss the issue with his father and get back to you
09/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
09/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yex
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Nyanga
09/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the contact? @263775548429 <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, @263775548429. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles' FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
09/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If Charles' is a more convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Yes
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Will discuss the payment issue with my husband and get back to you
14/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Dear parents and Nathanael!

I hope you are well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message when you were online, as it was a long weekend here in India, followed by a national holiday—Diwali, also known as the festival of lights. I hope you were able to discuss about the payment with your husband.
14/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes I am
14/11/23, 1:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Okay
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Noted
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes it does
14/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
14/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
14/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 537 3949: No
14/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
14/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
14/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

14/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
14/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
14/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
14/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Okay
14/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
14/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Okay thank-you
17/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nathanael!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
17/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Good evening. Not yet. His father was not around. Will give you the outcome of our discussion tomorrow
17/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall wait for the same.

18/11/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective? <This message was edited>

18/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 537 3949: Okay
19/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 554 8429: Good afternoon. We've discussed the offer and after careful considerations we've decided to wait for his A level results. We are considering having him take a career in computer engineering. Thank you so much for the help and the offer. I think he needs more time to think about his career. I hope you will give him another chance when he's decided
20/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Nathanael!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Thank you for sharing the update with me. I would like to let you know that the benefits provided under the endowment law will cease to exist at that time, and you will lose out on this current university's offer letter as well. Also In conclusion, may I know why you wish to study Computer Engineering?
20/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes I am ready
21/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and may I know if you were able to go through my above message?
22/11/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
22/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Well computer engineering has always been a dream of mine but we will come up with a decision once the results are out
22/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. Now, regarding the A-level exam you're inquiring about, I would like to clarify that it's not the A-level points but rather the subject combinations that determine a student's eligibility for the course in India. I hope this clears things up?
22/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Yes it does
22/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 537 3949: But my parents thought that it would be best to first wait for my results then decide on what is best according to my results

With that said, I'd also like to inform you that for the course you're interested in, Computer Engineering, is still not eligible even after receiving the results based on your subject combinations. However, there are alternative options available for this course. I hope this clarifies things?
