11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, that's great! Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
11/10/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 7453492: This is Kaunda’s mother,I have been standing in for him throughout this process. He started it with Mr Shubham but now he has gone back to school,he is in a boarding school and he will be finishing his grade 12 exams next month.
11/10/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977453492 

I understand the situation really well. I definitely want Kaunda to not compromise on his studies and give his best. Therefore, in order to prevent Kaunda from falling behind, you can attend the initial process with me and wait for his exams to finish.
11/10/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: It is important to complete the initial process. In order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects.
11/10/23, 11:00 am - +260 97 7453492: Okay noted
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Kaunda,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon
Okay I am available now.
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7453492: Kindly go through them for me.
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/10/23, 2:01 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay that sounds good.
Well noted
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
11/10/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay done.
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted.
11/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Kaunda* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay well noted
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Kaunda* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7453492: Done
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Kaunda*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Kaunda* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically! <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let's wrap up today's session here. We'll reconvene tomorrow at the same time, 1:30 PM. Looking forward to seeing you there! ✨
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay thank you and have a great day.
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,@260977453492 

Should we move forward with our discussion?
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon,yes we can.
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Kaunda* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7453492: Done
12/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Kaunda* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Kaunda* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
12/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted thank you
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay well noted.
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.

As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
