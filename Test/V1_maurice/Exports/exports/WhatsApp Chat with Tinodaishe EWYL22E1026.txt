How are you?
29/08/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It's crucial that you provide the required information, or else, your name may unfortunately be included in the Academic Board of Edoofa's defaulters list. Your cooperation in this matter is highly valued and appreciated.
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

20/09/23, 12:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're having a good day.

I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
17/10/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
