I hope you all are in great health and spirits. Thank you for the lovely wishes. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 565 7295: Noted, thank you.
17/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 565 7295: I have understood that the Edoofa Grant had been awarded to honour the belief that Edoofa had in me .That is if l prove my zeal and dedication to my studies.
75% of my university lessons and 75% of my EWYL lessons as well..
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Indeed , so thoughtful
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Edoofa Grant identifies and supports talented individuals and are committed to their studies and show a great effort to their academic putsuits. The grant is received as financial assistance on top of the already given scholarship mentioned in the university admission acceptance letter. They are terms associated to it which the student should abide to.
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed.Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 565 7295: I think it is for recognition and support of your hardwork
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Therefore l should remain consistent and show my unwavering effort towards my dream.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Sure , thank you ma'am.
17/08/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 336 0587: Yes, we are very proud and happy that she got this grant. We will continuously urge her to keep on working hard and not let such opportunities pass.
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Noted , thank you Ms Jasmine.
17/08/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Yes ma'am, you said we should proceed and sign this right?
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, You can do this by tomorrow.
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Okay ma'am

29/08/23, 10:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

08/11/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.
