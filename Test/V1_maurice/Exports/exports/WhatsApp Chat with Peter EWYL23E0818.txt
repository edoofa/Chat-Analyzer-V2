My name is Sharda, and you can refer to me as Ms. Sharda. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 21-1-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
21/11/23, 8:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it is our session time, are you ready for the same?
21/11/23, 11:53 pm - +260 97 9398899: Sorry Mr. Sharda I was cought up with some work. Am doing a part time job
22/11/23, 8:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Peter 
I hope you are doing well.

I appreciate you letting me know about your part-time job commitment. But I would also like to inform that it is important to attend the EWYL Training sessions during the scheduled time. 
You can not learn the skills and earn the scholarship credits until you are thorough with what the EWYL Projects are and what needs to be done.

This is an opportunity that you have been given and I want you to avail this with an open and accepting mind. And if you will stay consistent with your efforts, I will be more than happy to guide you to a direction of financial independence and personal growth.
