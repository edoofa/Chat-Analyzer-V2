I hope this message finds you well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Hello Ms Kirti .
We can begin
06/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you are available to have a discussion now?
06/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes we can
06/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes ! Very accurate
06/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

06/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes ! I remember
06/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
06/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 620 5777: That's when i should receive offer latters from Universities and pay the registration fee
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok ,i would like to know the percentage of scholarship i will get if i pass with higher grades like 13 ,14 or 15 points
06/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
06/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yeah ,done
06/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
06/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes !
06/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
06/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok , thanks
06/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
06/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
06/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 620 5777: I'm done
06/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
06/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263776205777 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
06/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok , I understand
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes ,it is
06/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes , it's helpful
06/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 620 5777: I understand everything
06/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 620 5777: You can explain
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
06/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ol
06/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok
06/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes
06/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok
06/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Clear
06/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
06/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Clear
06/10/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Clear
06/10/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/10/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 620 5777: No ,i don't
06/10/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
06/10/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes , i am
06/10/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok
11/10/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Enock.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on Saturday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
16/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 620 5777: Yes we discussed
16/10/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
16/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok
16/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 620 5777: We wanted to know about the off campus hostels ,are the costs charged per head or per room
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Clear
16/10/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you wish to share?
16/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Do i only receive one offer letter
16/10/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Ok clear
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Clear
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Enock!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 620 5777: No
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Enock!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yeah that's clear thank you
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the same now dear?
18/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 620 5777: Yes everything is clear
19/10/23, 9:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Enock!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 620 5777: When i want to pay 300 though bank how much should it be
19/10/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: It would be $300 only. In case of Bank Transfer, the charges can only be known from the side of the bank itself.
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 620 5777: So should i ask the bank teller
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can take their help as well.

19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask are you planning to make the direct Bank Transfer to the university please?
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 620 5777: No ,to the local one that uses FBC bank
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, I would like to mention that the amont will also change since the transfer charges will be 12.5% therefore, the total amount that you should pay becomes $300 + 12.5% = $338.
