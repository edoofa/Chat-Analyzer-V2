07/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
07/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
07/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 771 4290: I didn't understand clearly step 1
07/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Is it that l will undergo a video conference or
07/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. You will be provided with a series of videos that you can undergo for content consumption, and once you have completed this, you will have finished step 1. May I know if we are on the same page here?
07/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 771 4290: well understood sir
07/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
07/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes this is clear and direct
07/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

08/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 771 4290: It's okay I am ready
08/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
08/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

-an edoofian should have an open minded
- be able to follow instructions and having a teachable spirit 
- they also discuss about the benefits of the scholarship or the scholarship cridits(EWYL) which enables students to have a feeling of independence

The the second video that is Edoofas vision for the students 
They were discussing more about the most important character that distinguishes a successful student from the crowd as they gave reference of a certain student who was from Gana
-the main purpose of the Edoofa scholarship program is to atleast solve problems being faced by students world wide by giving scholarship and making the education affordable
- they also discussed that their main point as parents  is to increase the capacity of success thus making students more responsible and independent

Then in the third video they were discussing about their hard works in identifying good school s,colleges and universities which is good for students with good accomodations 
-and they also said that three important things to instill in a student is good attitude, knowledge and skills  as they are prepared mentally so that they are able to serve the community that is their main point 

In the last video in which they were discussing about the importance of statement of purpose as they say it is were you convince them about your uniqueness, strength, academic progress , reason why you chose that program or even your achievement s
09/09/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as an unforseen work that just came up. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconvene on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
09/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Thanks it's okay enjoy the weekend
11/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Danga. How are you doing this lovely evening?
12/09/23, 12:52 am - +263 77 771 4290: Good morning sir how are you, sorry for the late reply can you schedule my session at 7:30pm that's when I would have come back from school
12/09/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Good evening
12/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes I am ready
12/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered. <This message was edited>

13/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! The question is asking you to provide an introductory statement that briefly showcases your skills, along with an illustrative example, all presented in an audio format. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the question means:

*Give a Brief Introduction*: Start by introducing yourself in a concise manner. Mention your name, a brief background, and possibly a sentence or two about your expertise or field of skills.

13/09/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 771 4290: 2- psychology is the study of human mind and human behavior.How human mind works in different situations,how it develops perception and the various circumstances which affect the development of human behavior.It includes four major concepts which are clinical , cognitive behavioral and biopsychology.It is a science because as the definition state that psychology is a scientific study meaning psychologist employ the scientific method through the stating of the question, offering theory and constructing rigorous laboratory or field experiment to test the hypothesis .This shows it is an exact science but a social science.Research serve to enable psychologist to have an evidence based strategies that solve problems ,and to determine whether the treatment is effective enough

13/09/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Stigma arises from lack of understanding of mental health , ignorance and misinformation and also because some people have negative attitude or beliefs towards it.Thus can lead to discrimination against people with mental illness .Stigma often comes because of fear, inaccurate or misleading media presentation of mental illness .It mostly comes from sources such as personal, social and family beliefs.In the contrary it can be reduced through raising awareness compaigns to educate people the dangers of neglecting others and the benefits of supporting each other which results in a healthy society
13/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 771 4290: 5-

15/09/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Danga

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Danga EWYL23E0591*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Bw8zZ5qCPfP41FlAmAXEoK"
15/09/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Danga Evernice and my EWYL group name is Danga EWYL23E0591.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
15/09/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
15/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Danga. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Good evening yes I am ready
15/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Psychology)  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 771 4290: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes you are correct
15/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
15/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes l am ready
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
15/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes that's impossible
15/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Could you please explain a bit further here l did not understand clearly
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it is referring to the university registration fee. The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
15/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 771 4290: I understand
15/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
15/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes well understood
15/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
15/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
15/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
15/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes I have
15/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
15/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
15/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 771 4290: This is clear enough
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
15/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Not yet maybe later
15/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process.  In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
15/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Monday at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.

15/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we shall connect at the said timeframe.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes well understood
19/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course that is my wish also
19/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
19/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes I am ready
19/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
19/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Thanks l have read them
19/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
19/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Very clear
19/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course well vibrant
19/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes sir
19/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Well understood
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/09/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Nothing
19/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!
20/09/23, 5:20 am - +263 77 771 4290: No nothing yet
20/09/23, 5:23 am - +263 77 771 4290: Okay thank you
20/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Good afternoon l hope you are doing well
20/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Thank you it's a wonderful evening indeed
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes I am well prepared
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 771 4290: It would be my pleasure if you provide more information for me to understand better
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay I get it well understood
20/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course it's impossible
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course atleast they are some of the best ways to solve the situation
20/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Very clear

Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?

20/09/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for pointing out the error. There was a technical error on my end. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 771 4290: No l don't have any
20/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. We are yet to discuss the remaining points 2 and 3. Shall I share I am staring with the poin 2 now.
20/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Well understood
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 771 4290: This is very clear and resonate
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I shall be concluding our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

25/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 771 4290: No l don't have any at the moment
25/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Danga's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Danga's is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
25/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 387 2106: yes
25/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Danga's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course.

2-3 years (6semisters)
3-300USD
4-my registration fee is $750
29/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay I understand
29/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 771 4290: So how many months does each semester consist
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Each Semester consists of a total of 6 months including the active months in which the curriculum is carried out as well as the break time too. I hope you are clear with this?
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes very clear
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 771 4290: So one person has to pay a minimum of $2000 !?
29/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Now, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes  l understand
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes please proceed
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 771 4290: So I have to pay an amount of $750
29/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay I understand
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 771 4290: No l stay in Mhondoro Ngezi
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Mashonaland West
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 771 4290: So is it the only way to make the payments
29/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes please
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Thanks
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 771 4290: So l have to pay the full $750 now
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through these messages of mine please?
29/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes please l am sorry to ask l understood this message l just wanted to clarify  only like is it supposed to be this year only
29/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, you do not have to say sorry. Now, on that note, the registration fee is to be paid as per the deadlines that I have mentioned.
29/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay thank you
29/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
29/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay now it's clear
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes very clear
29/09/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
29/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course I understand
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 771 4290: No l don't have any
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 771 4290: You may proceed
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

29/09/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
29/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay thank you

Due to the Diwali Festive Holidays, our team was unavailable and not working for the past week. Unfortunately, we couldn't connect with you during this time to obtain an update on your payment status.

Moving forward, could you please provide an update regarding the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well?

21/11/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Danga!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
