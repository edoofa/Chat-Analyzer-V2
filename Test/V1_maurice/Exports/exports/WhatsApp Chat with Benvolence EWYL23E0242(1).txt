The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/08/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 680 2311: Okay l will do so
25/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing this Friday?

May we begin with our session🌟
25/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 680 2311: Iam good thanks
25/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 680 2311: Yes please
25/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you form the WhatsApp group that we have last discussed?
25/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 680 2311: Not yet

Im still in the process of compiling a list of students who are writing this year
25/08/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, please make sure that this weekend you form the group and connect with as many students as possible.
25/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

26/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Benvolence!
How are you?
26/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent job on submitting the form! I've promptly shared it with our highly dedicated counseling team. It's essential that you keep up consistent communication with the student and promptly attend to any questions or concerns they might have. Your proactive engagement will ensure a smooth process.
26/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 621 0247: We are facing challenges of electricity and network here in Zimbabwe thats why we are failing to connect on time
27/09/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Benvolence!
How are you?
27/09/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I can understand that.
27/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 680 2311: How are you doing
28/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Benvolence!

I am doing well, thank you.
28/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session🌈
28/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 621 0247: Morning how are you
28/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
28/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 621 0247: Lets begin
28/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Benvolence can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
28/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 621 0247: Yes madam noted
28/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
28/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
28/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
28/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

04/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 680 2311: Okay I will do so madam
09/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 680 2311: So shall we keep saying "Iam a proud Edoofian" even when the sessions have been put on hold?
09/10/23, 12:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
09/10/23, 12:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have adjusted to your school schedule because I believe you must be occupied in exam preparations and therefore, I want you give you complete focus there. So I would recommend that we connect on the EWYL Group only in case you require me else, you don't need to follow any process meanwhile.
16/10/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

I am excited to hear your views on it?
I think Zimbabwe and India, despite their geographical and cultural differences, share certain similarities in their festive traditions. Both countries celebrate major festivals with vibrant colors, music, and a strong sense of community. Both nations also celebrate various agricultural festivals, reflecting the importance of farming in their societies. Additionally, the idea of family and community bonding is central to both countries' celebrations, emphasizing the significance of togetherness during these festive occasions.
27/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 680 2311: In Zimbabwe we celebrate the National  Heroes'Day ,The Defense Forces Day as well as the Unity Day in aAugust and December respectively
27/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 621 0247: In zimbabwe we also celebrate the 21st movement and our presidents birthday
30/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 680 2311: Iam good 

How are you doing
01/11/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, esteemed and proud Edoofians parents!

I trust your week is off to a fantastic start, and I'm absolutely delighted to be a part of this remarkable family that nurtures such brilliant students and parents who envision a bright future with us. Your trust, faith, and confidence in us fill me with immense pride.

Today, I'm thrilled to introduce you to our exceptional team, the _Department of Student Welfare_, who will be your child's guiding light once they arrive in India. Their unwavering commitment is to foster your child's growth and development throughout their journey. They'll be there to support your child in the extraordinary EWYL Program and address any concerns, from admission to accommodation, and everything in between📈
01/11/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: I'm excited to share some heartwarming stories of the interactions our officers have had with our students✨.
