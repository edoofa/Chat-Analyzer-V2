Lately, I've noticed that some of you haven't been consistently following your EWYL ritual on the EWYL line. I want to stress that this small gesture plays a significant role in maintaining your attendance records and ensuring you receive the full benefits of our program.

So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to kindly remind you that we have our sessions regularly scheduled, and it would be great if you could join us without needing a reminder each time. Your participation is valuable, and it helps you get the most out of our sessions. I believe in your ability to take this responsibility seriously and be more punctual in our sessions.

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

So, I wanted when would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
