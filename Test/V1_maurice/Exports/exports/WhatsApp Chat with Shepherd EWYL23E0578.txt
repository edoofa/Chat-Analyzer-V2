I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/10/23, 8:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/10/23, 5:48 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok I understand my mentor.As I am still on the exams I will be not available during mid weeks usually. But sometimes I may be available. I will make sure that I'm available during that time on Saturday's. Thank you so much my mentor

Kindly excuse me fro the delay, I was attending an important meeting with the head of our department.

21/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok madam thank you for connecting
21/10/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
21/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 524 3459: My name is Shepherd Chokuwa. I come from Zimbabwe .I am 18 years old and I am interested in music. I am talented in music especially singing and playing pianos. I am a person who is very patient and passion. I am also a confident person and I can also consider my self as a hard-working person and someone who can face any challenge and overcome.
21/10/23, 9:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you. It's awesome that you're into music, especially singing and playing the piano. Sounds like you've got some serious talent there! Being patient, passionate, confident, and hardworking are all great qualities, and they'll definitely serve you well in pursuing your musical dreams. Keep that determination going, and you'll overcome any challenge that comes your way. Rock on! 🎵🎹🎤
21/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so much Ms Ananya. I really appreciate your inspirations
21/10/23, 9:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 524 3459: No I don't understand. I would be glad if you can explain.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok ok I understand madam thank you so much for explaining
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 524 3459: I am through madam thank you
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here! I would suggest that you read the document and share your understanding with me on Monday!

I'll be away from 10th to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

I hope you are doing well. I want to highlight that, despite constant reminders and messages, you have crossed the deadline for completing your orientation with me.

Please remember that you signed a document committing to finishing your orientation program with me to proceed with your scholarship procedures.

Today being the last day, it would be great if we could either connect today or schedule our session for the day. This way, I can ensure a hassle-free and progressive journey for you.
20/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya I am sorry for not connecting. I had been finishing the exams and I am glad to let you know that the exams have come to an end. I also faced another challenge of a phone break up but I am glad to be back to you and I hope that I will be available regularly for all the sessions thank you
20/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Shepherd, I understand that however, you could have informed me earlier about this, and I could helped you with a fast track process.

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
20/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I am clear with that. Thank you so much

20/11/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Shepherd, can you please specify the break you are talking about?

21/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I am glad to connect with you this morning and I hope you are doing well.
21/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 524 3459: According to my understanding the EWYL program is a very good and best program. According to my analysis I found out that the EWYL helps students to benefit to a greater extend by getting in touch with different organisations that may help in employments as soon as a student finish the course in India. Particularly I also realized that the program reduces the costs of the fees required by allowing students to earn scholarship credits. I also noticed that the EWYL helps according to the efforts and hardworking of a student.
21/11/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning! 🚀
