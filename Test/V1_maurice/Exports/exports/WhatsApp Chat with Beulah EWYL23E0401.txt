04/08/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
04/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 938 5837: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much, Beulah for introducing yourself so gracefully!
04/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 938 5837: You welcome
04/08/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 938 5837: No I don't
04/08/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/08/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 938 5837: Ok thank you I understand
04/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
04/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 938 5837: Wooow nice
04/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 938 5837: I read it
04/08/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
04/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 938 5837: Nice to meet you Ms Deepali and Ms Davi
04/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
04/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 938 5837: I am done
04/08/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
04/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 938 5837: I liked all sections too😊
04/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
04/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 938 5837: Yaah it's a great deal
04/08/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Beulah?
04/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 938 5837: It sounds good ma'am
04/08/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
04/08/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
04/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 938 5837: Yes I am ready
04/08/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.

12/09/23, 8:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Beulah!

That is alright, I understand. However, why didn't you contact me?

Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school.

12/09/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:27 am - +27 74 483 6816: Thanks you so much, when  Beulah is back from school she will notify you,YOU are right she is under pressure of preparation for final exams but for her not to lag behind she will choose on the outlined working hours you extended for her and we greatly appreciate.
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great!
19/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 938 5837: Greetings to you Miss Ananya .I wasn't online for the past few days because of my exam preparations.I can attend a session on Saturday

21/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 938 5837: Okay
22/11/23, 6:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Beulah!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my student's exams are over now, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step toward their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted when would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
