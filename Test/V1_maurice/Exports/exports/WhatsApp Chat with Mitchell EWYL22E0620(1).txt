I understand that you may have opted out of the EWYL Program, but I'd like to offer you an opportunity to explore EWYL projects. By participating, you can not only earn credits but also acquire valuable industrial skills. These skills go beyond the program's scope and encompass various areas such as webinars, creating a digital workspace environment, including research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content development, influencer marketing, social media engagement, and blog writing, to name just a few.

In the outside world, acquiring these skills can be quite expensive, but we're making them accessible to you right at your doorstep. Could you please share your thoughts on this?

04/10/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share just one thing with me that will just take 2 minutes:

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call

I would want that your parents also acknowledges the same so that they are aware of it.
04/10/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As I mentioned in the call about the video, it should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

Please include:
a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
04/10/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *DEADLINE OF THE SAME* - 05/10/2023, 8 PM IST
05/10/23, 4:37 am - +91 75081 21762: Good morning ma’am
05/10/23, 4:38 am - +91 75081 21762: I’ll be able to share Friday evening
05/10/23, 4:38 am - +91 75081 21762: I have assignments and CAs today and tomorrow
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mitchell!
How are you?
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I will wait till Friday.
Meanwhile you can add your parents in this group and share what you understood from the $300 plan, so that they can acknowledge?
05/10/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will ask the admin to make you the admin of the group so that you can add them directly. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 2:00 pm - +91 75081 21762: Good afternoon
09/10/23, 2:00 pm - +91 75081 21762: Can I add my parents now ?
09/10/23, 2:05 pm - +91 75081 21762: My journey with Edoofa has been fruitful and beneficial yes in the beginning it seemed too good to be true but they have been the Best 
They helped me out with the school paper work for Freshers and the FRRO documentation processing 
India has different weather conditions from those in Zimbabwean 
Commodities are relatively cheaper and the average man can thrive 
I had difficulties settling in at first and adjusting to my demanding timetable at school but I am striving to pull through and manage it 
My block has everything necessary for my program and education
09/10/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mitchell!
How are you?

Yes, you can add your parents now.
09/10/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing Mitchell, can you share this everything via a video as mentioned in the message?
09/10/23, 2:21 pm - +91 75081 21762: I’m sorry ma’am but I don’t feel comfortable 
I can however make an audio if that is still okay ?
09/10/23, 2:21 pm - +91 75081 21762: Alright
09/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video serves twofold purposes:
First, this video will be shared with all the students whose forms you will be sharing. In case we don't have the video, those forms will not surpass the counseling stage hence no credits will be given for the same.

Secondly, there is a bigger picture that you have to see for the same. When you go for interviews and sit in front of recruiters, they will see your confidence and presentability. Therefore this is the beginning of that phase where you start building it.
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
