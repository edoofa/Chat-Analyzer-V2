05/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 832 8898: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the identity proof?
05/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 832 8898: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I dont remember well but i think that were were on step 3
05/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, may I know if you remember anything about the registration fee?
05/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I dont remember on the registration fee
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes you may proceed
05/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
05/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
05/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes we are clear lets proceed
05/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
05/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778328898 greetings may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope this message finds you well. No need to apologize at all. Technical issues and forgetfulness happen to all of us from time to time. I appreciate you getting back in touch. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Good afternoon ma'am
Yes we may continue
06/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear so far?
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes it is clear
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
06/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 832 8898: For now everything is clear
06/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Humble greetings ma'am
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778328898 good evening to you too. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Humble greetings ma'am
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263778328898 may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes we can connect
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 832 8898: We can proceed
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Takudzwa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 832 8898: That sounds good
12/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes it does
12/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes it makes sense
12/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I am following
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 832 8898: What if i fail to pay the remaining part within a period of 30 days , will i be given some time to complete it or
12/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely that, however, let me help you understand that the generation of offer letters depends upon the university please, every university has a different timeline for evaluating the applications and then generating the offer letter, so please do not worry I am sure this will not be the case, since you as a parent would want the best for your child also and do not wish to miss this opportunity.
12/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Thank you for explaining further on that. We may continue
12/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 832 8898: You can provide me with some information
12/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I understand it
12/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes
12/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes i agree
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 832 8898: My phone is about to shut down because of lack of power. So can you please allow our session to be conducted tomorrow.
12/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Of course, there's no problem at all. However, the if your battery allows the discussion will only take your 10 minutes time.
12/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Ok fine you may
12/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes its clear
12/10/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
13/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Takudzwa.

13/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 832 8898: That's okay we will resume at 07:30pm then
13/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Humble greetings ma'am

13/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes i would like to know about the costs
13/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand better, earlier when we connected in March the costs were explained to you however If you want I can definitely help you recall the cost break down.

13/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
13/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes you may proceed
13/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
13/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
13/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes we are
13/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
13/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
13/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes its clear
13/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
13/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 832 8898: No questions.
You have explained it in an understandable way
13/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Tadiwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that tadiwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes i am
13/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Thank you
14/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Humble greetings ma'am
16/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as it was the weekend hence we were unable to connect with you, may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
17/10/23, 10:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
17/10/23, 10:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
17/10/23, 10:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/10/23, 11:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 886 6272: Good morning ma'am, we are indeed super excited. Takudzwa starts his final end of year examinations this morning with a paper from 0900 to 1200,  If it's possible we could reconnect at 1400 after he is done, hopefully the time suits you well
18/10/23, 10:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Parents and Takudzwa, and thank you for sharing the update regarding Takudzwa's exams. We wish him all the best, and I am certain he will perform well.
18/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks for the best wishes
18/10/23, 10:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. As you requested, to ensure we can discuss the offer letter well and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if you will be available to connect with us today in the afternoon at 02:00 PM? 

This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete your admission formalities. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 886 6272: On the time do you mean 20.00 or its 1400 cozifits 1400 it's our afternoon this side
18/10/23, 10:41 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for acknowledging that, @263778866272. The scheduled time for us to reconnect is in the afternoon at 02:00 PM as requested by you. I hope you will be available at that time?
18/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 886 6272: I will be available
18/10/23, 11:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing @263778866272. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 02:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion and will be fully prepared to assist you. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks, we reconnect then
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Good afternoon, yes I went through the offer letter and we are equally excited about it. However I wanted to find if this then means that you will not be submitting any other applications to other universities
18/10/23, 5:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Wellington, I was looking forward to receiving your response, but since I haven't received a message, I wanted to follow up and see if we are still connected and if you have had the chance to review my previous messages? 

Your timely response is valuable to us, as it will enable us to move forward with our planned discussions.
18/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Sorry work commitments, I had to attend to something urgent. Getting back yes I understood the accommodation options available. For off campus accommodation what mode of transport will they have to use to get to the university college
18/10/23, 5:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, @263778866272, there is no need to apologize. I completely understand the work commitments you have.
18/10/23, 5:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Continuing our discussion, it is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.
18/10/23, 5:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, addressing your query about transport facilities from the off-campus accommodation, most off-campus housing options are within walking distance of the university. This proximity usually eliminates the need for additional transportation and related expenses. However, in cases where a student prefers to stay further away from the university's immediate vicinity, they can easily find daily commute options at an affordable cost, typically around $10 per month.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks you were very elaborate. It makes it easier for the student to then make their informed choices once they get to the university
18/10/23, 6:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263778866272. Moving forward, as you can see in Takudzwa's offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Absolutely clear,per year 2 semesters so that is $100 *2=$200
18/10/23, 6:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Takudzwa's overall cost of education.
18/10/23, 6:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 886 6272: We are together, but on the $750 I was asking if it can be paid in installments
18/10/23, 6:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Wellington, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Takudzwa through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Sure please kindly go ahead and explain how it works
18/10/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Mr. Wellington. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Takudzwa's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/10/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Takudzwa's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 886 6272: I get you the full payment option and the instalments option are now clearly explained. But a point to note it's Takudzwa not Yemurai as written in your last message
18/10/23, 7:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, Mr. Wellington. I was interacting with one of our other students, and it seems like I mistakenly used her name while addressing Takudzwa. I have edited the message so that we can be on the same page. I appreciate your attention to such details.
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Appreciated ma'am, I understand you having to juggle multiple parents isn't kids play. Indeed we are on the same page
18/10/23, 8:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you @263778866272. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 886 6272: We stay in Harare, please go ahead with the alternative mode available for the payments
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks for the contact I shall be getting in touch with him
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 886 6272: Please kindly provide the account details, then I can have all the options open. When making the payments I can then make the final choice.
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly Mr. Wellington, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
19/10/23, 7:01 am - +263 77 886 6272: Morning ma'am , sorry I dozed off without notice, I was tired.
19/10/23, 8:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Mr. Wellington,

I understand, and there is no need to apologize. We all need our rest, and it is perfectly normal to doze off when we are tired. I hope you are now feeling refreshed and ready to continue our discussion about Takudzwa's offer letter. We are here to commence our discussion and address any questions or concerns you may have regarding your child's university admisison.
19/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks for understanding. The fees and accommodation issues we are fine with however if you can allow to look at other issues regards the course
19/10/23, 8:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263778866272. I understand that you are comfortable with the fees and accommodation aspects. As you mentioned that you would like to discuss other matters concerning the course, please go ahead and share your concerns or questions. 

We are here to assist you, and your child's education is our priority.
19/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 886 6272: On the course i did not see where it talked about industrial attachment or work internship. Please help fully understand how the course will unbundle.
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Wellington, let me provide you with a clearer understanding. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In the context of industrial attachment in Zimbabwe, India refers to it as "placements." Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
19/10/23, 9:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
19/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 886 6272: Please simplify it further for me, does this mean that only in their pre-final year that's when they conduct placement searches. This side of the world during their course the student sends a full year in placement with real work situations interfacing with customers and clients so that when they are done with their course they have an exact feel of how it is like at the workplace
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand your concern, Mr. Wellington. In India, the placement drives typically occur during the pre-final year of a student's education. This is when students interview with companies, and if they are successful, they receive job offers and work with the companies in their final year. 

Hence, the practical work experience usually happens after this placement in their final year of graduation. While the approach might be slightly different from what you mentioned, students do get real work experience through these placements, which helps them prepare for the workplace. I hope this addresses the query in a better way now?
19/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 886 6272: Many thanks it's now settled, I have understood it now. Furthermore, this placement in India is usually for a full year or just a semester. Please elaborate
19/10/23, 9:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Wellington, the duration of the placement depends on the company offering the job and can vary from six to twelve months. However, most companies provide a year-long placement.
19/10/23, 9:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, now to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Takudzwa at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 886 6272: Very well understood ma'am, the cost of Takudzwa's education per annum us$2800
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Takudzwa's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 886 6272: It is very clear ma'am, the EWYL program actually encourages the student to be self reliant and to work understanding that the more effort you put in the more financial rewards you will get
19/10/23, 10:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Rightly said @263778866272. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Takudzwa with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 10:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Takudzwa can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 886 6272: It demonstrates clearly how it's important for us as parents to encourage Takudzwa to work more in order to reduce the financial strain on us as parents. Takudzwa as the student will have to be headstrong and smarter in order to earn more credits. Its pretty clear
19/10/23, 10:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Mr. Wellington. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Takduzwa will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education. His mentors will undoubtedly provide him with valuable guidance to help him reach his academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 10:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 886 6272: For now I am good thanks, please good ahead and share the university insights
19/10/23, 10:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, @263778866272. However, before I address the payment details, I would like to revisit a concern you raised in our previous conversations regarding other offer letters that Takudzwa might secure. Would you like us to address that concern before proceeding further?
19/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 886 6272: Please do address the concern
19/10/23, 10:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
19/10/23, 10:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As of now, Takudzwa's application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
19/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 886 6272: A bird in the bag is better than a thousand in the wild. We are good with what we have. Meanwhile we wait to get any other responses, if none it's still okay we will work with what we already have
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Rightly put @263778866272 and I resonate with your perspective. At the same time, our goal is to ensure that Takudzwa gets the best of the options and hence, as you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, in that case, there is a transfer option. 

Let us say, you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A, and in the same process, you end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias University. With this, Takudzwa would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias University and wouldn't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, the transfer option comes into play. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 886 6272: No I wasn't aware, it's important to always have a head start hence we are taking the offer while we wait to see if others will be availed
19/10/23, 10:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, to provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve Takudzwa's scholarship seat at Galgotias University by paying his registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if Takudzwa receives a better scholarship offer and decides to change his university, he will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that Galgotias University's offer is still the better choice, he can pursue his education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for Takudzwa's academic journey.
19/10/23, 10:49 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To illustrate this with an example: Let us assume you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve Takudzwa's seat there. Later on, Takudzwa received a better offer from University A, where the registration fee is also $750.

If you decide to switch his admission to University A, in that scenario, you would need to pay $750. However, because Takudzwa had already paid $750 to Galgotias University, this same amount would be adjusted against his fee at University A. Therefore, you would not need to pay any additional money to secure his scholarship seat at University A or to make the switch.

I hope this explanation clarifies the process, addresses your query and provides you with a better understanding of how it works?
19/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 886 6272: Thank you for the explanation, all our fears have been laid to rest. I really like the flexibility
