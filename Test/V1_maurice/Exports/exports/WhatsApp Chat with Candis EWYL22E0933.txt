I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00 - 07:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

18/10/23, 4:12 pm - +91 90560 10746: We shall see
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 90560 10746: Okay, this is noted
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:19 pm - +91 90560 10746: Okay noted
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I hope you will be able to create a video by Friday evening, right?
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - +91 90560 10746: Sunday evening would be  better because tommorrow and Friday my timetable is packed and I have assignments due I might not be able to reach that deadline

01/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
01/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 90560 10746: I just read the eligibility criteria
01/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 90560 10746: I think via social media , provided a well crafted poster is made  so that I can use it as an advertisement
01/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, let me share a few more then!
01/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 90560 10746: Noted!
01/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 90560 10746: Those are all great ideas
01/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 4:14 pm - +91 90560 10746: This is duly noted
01/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - +91 90560 10746: Yes I have read that in the document
01/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 90560 10746: I will, thank you!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?

15/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.

15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 90560 10746: Okay I will do so
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding today's session here.I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
