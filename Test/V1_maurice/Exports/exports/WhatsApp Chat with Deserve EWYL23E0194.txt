15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Deserve

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning sir....
How are you?
We are all fine 

Thank you so much sir...l will go with the second option for Saturday morning

09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Deserve
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
