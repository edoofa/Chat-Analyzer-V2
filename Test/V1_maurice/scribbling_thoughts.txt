Day 1 - Process the chats and check for duplicates
PART 1

import required_libraries  # (like os, pandas, etc.)

Function to navigate directories and fetch chat files:
    Initialize an empty DataFrame with columns: ['Date', 'Team', 'Person', 'Chats URL', 'Chat Name', 'Chat Group Name', 'File Size', 'Expected Format']
    
    for each Date directory given:
        for each Team subdirectory in Date:
            for each Person subdirectory in Team:
                for each chat file (students.txt) in Person:
                    Extract required details:
                        Date = Date from the Date directory name
                        Team = Team from the Team subdirectory name
                        Person = Person from the Person subdirectory name
                        Chats URL = [logic to be defined later]
                        Chat Name = Name of the chat file
                        Chat Group Name = [logic to determine this from Chat Name]
                        File Size = Get size of the chat file
                        Expected Format = [to be discussed later]
                    Add extracted details to the DataFrame

    Return the populated DataFrame

Main Program:
    Call the function to navigate directories and fetch chat files
    Display the DataFrame or perform any initial analysis (if required)


PART 2

import required_libraries  # (like os, pandas, re, etc.)

Function to parse chat group name and check format:
    Input: file name (string)
    Output: chat group name (string), expected format (string)

    Remove "WhatsApp Chat with " prefix from the file name
    Check if there are any duplicates (like "(1)", "(2)" etc.) in the file name
    If duplicates exist:
        Keep the file with the highest duplicate number (max value)
        Trim the duplicate part from the file name
    Split the file name into parts (separated by space)
    Ensure there are exactly two parts:
        First part: Name or word in code
        Second part: Combination of letters and numbers
    If the file name meets these criteria:
        expected_format = "yes"
    Else:
        expected_format = "no"
    Return chat group name (without the .txt extension) and expected_format

Function to navigate directories and fetch chat data:
    Similar to previous function, but without 'Chats URL' and with the new logic for chat group name and expected format

Main Program:
    Call the function to navigate directories and fetch chat files
    Display the DataFrame or perform any initial analysis (if required)


PART 3 (actually a revised version for SALES group names)

Function to parse chat group name and check format:
    Input: file name (string), team name (string)
    Output: chat group name (string), expected format (string)

    Remove "WhatsApp Chat with " prefix and file extension from the file name
    Check for duplicates in the file name and remove them
    Split the file name into parts

    If team name is 'SALES':
        If there are exactly two parts in the file name:
            expected_format = 'yes'
        Else:
            expected_format = 'no'
    Else:
        Check for special characters in the first two parts of the file name
        If found:
            expected_format = 'no'
        Else:
            expected_format = 'yes'

    Return the chat group name and expected_format

Main Function to navigate directories and fetch chat data:
    Similar to the previous function, but call the updated parse_chat_group_name function with team name as an additional argument


PART 4 (final and refined version of table 1 code)

import required_libraries  # (like os, pandas, re, etc.)

Function to parse chat group name and check format:
    Input: file name (string), team name (string)
    Output: chat group name (string), expected format (string)

    Remove "WhatsApp Chat with " prefix and file extension from the file name
    Check for duplicates in the file name and remove them
    Split the file name into parts

    If team name is 'SALES':
        Use regex to check:
            - Pattern for 'EDOOFA' variants (EDOOFA, edoofa, Edoofa, EA) after an underscore
            - Bracketed date format like (16_11)
        If any pattern is found:
            expected_format = 'yes'
        Else:
            expected_format = 'no'
    Else:
        Check for special characters in the first two parts of the file name
        If found:
            expected_format = 'no'
        Else:
            expected_format = 'yes'

    Return the chat group name and expected_format

Function to navigate directories and fetch chat data:
    Initialize an empty DataFrame
    Walk through the directory structure (Date/Team/Person)
    For each chat file:
        Parse the chat group name and determine the expected format
        Populate the DataFrame with chat details

Main Program:
    Call the function to navigate directories and fetch chat files
    Split the DataFrame based on 'Expected Format' into 'df_king' and 'df_joker'
    'df_king' contains rows with expected_format = 'yes'
    'df_joker' contains rows with expected_format = 'no'
