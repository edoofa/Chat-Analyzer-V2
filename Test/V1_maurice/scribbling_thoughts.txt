    Initialize an empty DataFrame with columns: ['Date', 'Team', 'Person', 'Chats URL', 'Chat Name', 'Chat Group Name', 'File Size', 'Expected Format']
    for each Date folder in the root directory:
        for each Team folder in Date:
            for each Person folder in Team:
                for each chat file (students.txt) in Person:
                    Extract required details:
                        Date = Date from folder name
                        Team = Team from folder name
                        Person = Person from folder name

                        Chat Name = Name of the chat file
                        Chat Group Name = [logic to determine this from Chat Name]

                        Expected Format = [to be discussed later]
                    Add extracted details to the DataFrame

    Return the populated DataFrame
