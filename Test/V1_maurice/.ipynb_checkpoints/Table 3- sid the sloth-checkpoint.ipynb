It is called the $300 dollar package. All I have to do is invite people to join Edoofa and make sure they go through all the processes and finally come here to India. I have to invite atleast 3 students to join the program and for each payment they make for the enrollment, registration and departure i will be given $100 which totals to $300. So if i manage to get three students to come in a year, I’ll have $900 which will go to my school fees. This amount is almost my entire school fees for two semesters! All I need is your support and I know I will definitely pull through\n",

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.\n",
      "Extracted message: 22/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tanyaradzwa* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.\n",

      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 733 4920: OK well understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Yes it does\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Okay the other 50% has to be within the timeframe of the deadline\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the deadlines will be given by the university after the offer letter is generated. The above deadlines are tentative for your better understanding.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Alright\n",

      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 733 4920: OK noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 733 4920: I would appreciate it if you provide some information\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Yes it is clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",

I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 19/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 733 4920: Yes it is clear\n",

It has organized this task by  delegation to its subsidiaries, the energy generating company Zimbabwe Power Company and the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company. ZESA is the only power generator and supplier for the public grid, for many years the company has failed to produce enough power to meet the demands that's why load shedding is used on a routine basis and some rural areas don't have electricity over long periods\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee.

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I understand well\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we are\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So hw do you pay the total fee\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So I have to pay 100 then 900 and the other 900 on payment plan\n",

      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Let me help you understand your query above. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your \"Earn While You Learn\" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences.

      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes.

Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your o-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes plz\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 295 0153: More information\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their o Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their diploma degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their o-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Clear now\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two o Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok\n",

I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",

      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 715 2664: So usually the universities  will present their fee structure less the scholarship contributions?\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Thank you i understand.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: This is fantastic, thank you.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood, thanks\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Waiting for this message\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Crystal clear thanks for the explanation.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes. Less than 6points is a fail.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure, she will bring more than that and make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yes, totally\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yessss\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please your diploma grades would be enough for you to start with your bachelor's degree.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Oky, l understand\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Very beneficial.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,700 to $3,700 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2700 to $3700).\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: True.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Victoria is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I would rather save 850 annually.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $2,500 - $1,000 = $1500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 29th, 2023*.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Victoria through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Please explain.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 29, 2023*.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772332464 she has already met the admission criteria and that is why the university has offered her a scholarship, please.\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment.

      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Noted, it sounds  interesting\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Yes it does resonate\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 634 2510: Yes it does\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I'm following  ,so far I have nothing to inquire\n",

Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I'm available for the session\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 634 2510: It's now clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 634 2510: I agree\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Pride* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.\n",

We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.\n",

I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/09/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

This came as a surprise to him and his family, as they had already made extensive preparations for his departure, including booking his flight ticket. When he raised concerns about the short notice and the $625 payment, the Admission Officer admitted to an error, stating that only $250 was required to cover this semester's fees and enable Darlington to begin his studies. However, due to the confusion and uncertainty, his parents opted to cancel the ticket.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

I do not mean to solicit any angst or invective reprimands as that would only serve to distract me from my main agenda for being in India. I understand that as a member of Edoofa I have to participate in these extra carricular activities and I shall as soon as I have all my ducks well lined up.\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 11:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.\n",

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *\"I am a proud Edoofian*.\n",

On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Takura* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.\n",

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best.

For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.\n",

      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",

      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes\n",

      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 31/10/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 31, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 31, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 31, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yes , a student can only study at one university\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yesss we discussed on it\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.\n",

      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess we are\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Okay I understand sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess I understand sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your \"Earn While You Learn\" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Meaning that the fees will be reduced while im doing the EWYL\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Okay\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Your EWYL Journey will help you earns the credits which can be used in paying your tuition fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.\n",

      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please.

      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess Sir I understand\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yes sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess sir I followed\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it? <This message was edited>\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 126 2077: No sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Okay sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yess but I insist on 1\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 126 2077: Yes sir okay sir\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/11/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781262077 May I know if you have taken a note of the above messages?\n",

      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:17 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:27 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:31 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I understand all the things that you are saying I am wondering why is this process very long and this 750 that you are talking about I hope it is to be paid after the A level results are out\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 Today hopefully we will conclude our session, the delays has been occurred due to the delay in the forms. However, we are on the right track now, kindly don't worry. Although, I want to share that the Registration fees will be paid before the A level results as the offer letter will be shared with you soon once we complete this process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:41 pm - +27 84 448 3976: The only thing is that I am a parent I have a lot of things to do during the day it will be better to continue with Lenny I willbe there to help him because so far there is a lot of things that he is supposed to know also about this scholarship after his exams I am sure he is supposed to go through these things the videos and everything so that it will be easy for him to understand the EWYL program, I can't explain everything to him, I won't be able to say everything\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We truly agree with you understanding @27844483976, and you are absolutely right. It's important for Lenny to understand the whole process and I am sure she will go through our conversation and follow them the same. However if she would have any concern we are always here for her to help her out and understand everything.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:01 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Let's proceed\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:32 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:45 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:49 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?\n",

      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:45 pm - +265 885 25 22 54: Yes it does\n",
      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:48 pm - +265 885 25 22 54: Its quite helpful\n",

      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 07/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you so much well understood..\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok l understood everything but l can't get the concept of the paid registration fee is *adjusted* within their first year fee, effectively reducing it to *zero*.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you explain. This fee of $500 to $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok ok yah l get the sense now\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you,\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you once again for making it loud and clear by giving example..\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Wow its loud and clear,\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your \"Earn While You Learn\" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted,\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with that, the Visa fee is for $83, please.\n",

Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.\n",

With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Bathandile with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",

      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.\n",

As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 29th 2023.\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind.

      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm following\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes go on\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 71 833 7127: nothing ,lm understanding\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 833 7127: uuum lm not aware ,you can provide\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family.

Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",

      "Extracted message: 30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",

      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:16 pm - +260 96 6414725: Well understood. This is of great help to the stability of fees and ensure effective planning\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:45 pm - +260 96 6414725: The explanation is understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 5:44 pm - +260 96 6414725: This is a great offer to the parents\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 5:46 pm - +260 96 6414725: Yes, we have followed and understand the application of financial ease\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:41 pm - +260 96 6414725: No am not aware\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 7:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: Noted.\n",

      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 7:01 pm - +260 96 6414725: Indeed, the endowment plan gives a real edge to the students. Well noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",

      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.\n",

      "Extracted message: 30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",

Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",

      "Extracted message: 30/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

Thanks for the admission update and stuff. However, honestly the guy is quite unhappy with the university you gave him so far thus he was expecting an university with a global rank of 1000 and below. According to the research we have made as a family, MVN University ranks around 11000 out of 14000 something. From my viewpoint, the fact that the university was established in 2012 depict that it's still in infancy. So can you kindly help us out find a better one.\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750.

      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/10/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 5:30 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning, I will be available thanks.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Subilo,\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:54 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning, Available yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:57 am - +260 96 5393861: Understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 8:59 am - +260 96 5393861: Need more information\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:28 am - +260 96 5393861: Clear now\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:37 am - +260 96 5393861: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 10:18 am - +260 96 5393861: Yes agreed as the available options.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:34 am - +260 96 5393861: In an event that her final examination results will be ready by FEBRUARY 2024. What do we make of this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: yes, please as mentioned above, if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. If the results are not favourable she can reappear in her grade 12 and arrive in India in 2025.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:45 am - +260 96 5393861: Not very clear, if she proceeds with diploma then the results assessment proves otherwise would she need to start all over in her barchester's journey or it will be a continuation from there?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: No, please, let me help you explain, the second benefit here we give is that if a student does not wish to reappear in A- level, they can proceed with a diploma course, a diploma is an equivalent course so when a student is done with a diploma they can directly move ahead with a bachelors degree with the diploma grades.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 11:57 am - +260 96 5393861: If the duration for a diploma is 3 years, if she proceeds to barchester's she will do another 3 years making it 6 years in total. Is that the case?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:00 pm - +260 96 5393861: Ok noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:01 pm - +260 96 5393861: Understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:03 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes it is well understood.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Subilo's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that subilo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, the scholarship is determined by the student's extremely great merits in their grades 12 and 10, co-curricular actives, the SOP of the student, and Edoofa's recommendation too. I hope we are clear here?\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:32 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes, cleared\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:46 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes please\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly.

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 9:52 pm - +260 96 5393861: Will explore it\n",

      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +260 96 5393861: Following\n",

      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:14 pm - +260 96 5393861: Correct\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:44 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:52 pm - +260 96 5393861: Sending a child abroad to study is not an easy undertaking, anything across the border is costly due to the involvement of exchange fluctuation rates of the foreign currencies. Hence sending my daughter abroad on a 50% scholarship will somehow be  challenge to us back home. Despite the edoofer program being in place the strain will still be there. We looked at the initial proposed scholarship offer of 90% could at least help.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 1:54 pm - +260 96 5393861: In view of the aforesaid, since the measure was on the grade 10 results, can't we wait for the final Grade 12 results in order for the admission team to re-evaluate the scholarship offer as 50% would be costly to us to manage?\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +260 96 5393861: Good day once again, in our earlier submission and assessment for the acceptance onto the edoofa program, that's where they were advised how much scholarship you would gain. I could have missed the point that each university would give its own scholarship based on their assessment. I stand to be corrected?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:12 pm - +260 96 5393861: In addition, Are we expecting many more other offers from different universities with different percentages or its just one?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand the confusion that you must have had however, I believe that now we are on the same page each university has its own metrics based on which the scholarship quantum is evaluated to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their garde12, and 10 results, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:09 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well explained and clearly understood. Like I earlier on stated, while waiting for other university responses and the girl obtains her final grade 12 results, will there be room to resubmit the application based on the latest results for consideration?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias , you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias  and won't be able to join it in the future.\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:35 pm - +260 96 5393861: I do understand\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your second concern if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E/45% pasing grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:55 pm - +260 96 5393861: Very clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).\n",

Edoofa offers mind transformative education, it creates the feeling of independence on students. Edoofa has robust systems for ensuring that students get the best  education program that ultimately improves the capacities of the students . Edoofa boasts of years of experience which are paying dividends - students are passing with flying colors, overtime they created a network of well accredited universities in India where edoofians are placed for the right kind of knowledge, attitude and skills. The SOP is very critical as the learner will get an opportunity to convince the admission board why they should admit her in that program of study. Application form should be taken seriously, completed on time with efficacy.\n",

      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams.

      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities.

      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?\n",

      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. Please go ahead\n",
      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.\n",
      "Extracted message: 08/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. We are following. Please proceed\n",

This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Clear. Thank you for that, it will help us as a family during these harsh economic times\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear. We appreciate the contribution from Edoofa\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, as you are aware that we are connected with 250+ universities hence providing you with a list will be impossible for us, however, yes you do have the complete right to decline the offer letter from the university if it is not according to Thandekile's preference.\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Ok. Will check them over the internet\n",
      "Extracted message: 23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now.

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here. The off-campus accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 360 7200: That's clear. Thank you\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?\n",

      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear. Let me Google  the universities in India and will let you know. I currently do not have any preferences at the moment\n",
      "Extracted message: 15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future.\n",

Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?\n",

Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.\n",

This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.\n",

Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 622 4662: I've managed to go through the conversations and im happy please clarify on the total cost per annum with on campus accommodation\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes its  clear and im happy for the opportunity\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes its clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I  have managed to catch up. We can proceed\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 360 7200: All is clear. Let's proceed\n",

      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes he did\n",

      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.\n",
      "Extracted message: 05/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 715 2664: So usually the universities  will present their fee structure less the scholarship contributions?\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Thank you i understand.\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: This is fantastic, thank you.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood, thanks\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Waiting for this message\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Crystal clear thanks for the explanation.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes. Less than 6points is a fail.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure, she will bring more than that and make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yes, totally\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Very beneficial.\n",

Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,700 to $3,700 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2700 to $3700).\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: True.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Victoria is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $2,500 - $1,000 = $1500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted.\n",

This sets the *deadline date as November 29th, 2023*.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Victoria through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Please explain.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly.

      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 260 6194: 3)prosecuter is a lawyer for the state who represent the complainant in a criminal trial while an attorney is a lawyer who is not a state lawyer  and not limited to only criminal matters.The only difference is that prosecutor is employed by the state whilst an attorney can be in private practice etc. Basically all prosecutors are attorneys but not all attorneys are prosecutors. A prosecutor is responsible for representing individuals and corporations in civil cases and ensuring that the law is followed in criminal cases. As a consultant to their clients, lawyers serve as a resource to them, educating them about their rights and guiding them through the complex world of law. Moreover, one of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts ti to maintain their client's innocence.\n",

      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities.

      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?\n",

      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Very clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.\n",

Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750.

Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",

The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",

So my main question was am I going to pay half of the accommodation or I am expected to pay full amount for accommodation. As I have already pointed out that will help me to know what I afford and what I don't afford. I'm afraid to repeat what happened in the past when I assisted another girl and everything changed when the girl was already abroad. She was almost stuck in Cyprus when my contribution was no longer enough to cover her fees and accommodation. That's why I want to be clear with everything before I commit myself\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your concern as a parent where you are coming from, if you opt for on-campus you will have to make the payment all at once since it will be an annual deposit and it also includes food. However, it is expensive for our students and hence we prefer our students to opt for off-campus since it is cheaper and students enjoy the freedom of cooking their own meals and since all the students stay near it makes them feel like home away from home.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 369 1078: You know better than I and I am ready to follow your guidance. My biggest concern is not on  the type of accommodation but on my monetary contribution to it. I repeat, I am afraid of accepting responsibility on something that is not well defined in terms of how much will I be paying. The reason being I don't have a salary but I hustle to raise money to pay for education of disadvantaged children.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773691078 I completely understand what you are trying to say, however, as we discuss the letter in detail the annual break down will be more clear to you, please.\n",

Concerning our discussion, I just have one query which needs clarification. I am very clear with all other things you have explained to us. Only the issue of accommodation payment. I have had what you said that the University offers two types 2000 and 2500. Outside campus it is 1200 and own food. I have understood all that. My one query which I need you as my guide to be honest and straight forward is just to tell me whether I am going to cater for all accommodation and food issues for my girl or there will be some aid from somewhere. That one question addresses the remaining concerns I have. So my request to you is at 8:30 you can answer me on that question. Just send me your response.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 4:54 am - +263 77 369 1078: I am sorry that sometimes I sound as if I am not polite when you request time for discussions. The reason is the nature of my work does not give me time to be on WhatsApp discussions everyday. I am driving most of the time and meeting clients. Like today at 8.30 I have an unmovable session with a client my phone will be on silent until 9.30. By 10am I will be driving out and that means no time for WhatsApp until 2pm. From 4pm I have sessions until 6pm. So in such a day you are left without time for meetings that just pop up daily. Hence when you request a meeting I find space for it and book it. If we can discuss everything in simple, open and straight forward terms that helps me a lot and I appreciate. The reason being I have tight schedules almost every day which makes it very difficult for me to attend to our WhatsApp discussions if they are to come everyday. I really like discussions with you but time limits me.\n",

Our operational hours from Monday to Friday are from 12:00 PM to 08:00 PM, Zimbabwe time. Given that India is 03:30 hours ahead of Zimbabwe, extending our availability beyond these hours becomes impractical.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Noticing that we haven't been able to connect over the past couple of days, I have personally made myself available to address any concerns you may have and assist you in planning your child's education effectively. Therefore, once you share your availability with us,  we will arrange a suitable time for our discussion. In the meantime, let me address the concern you have in your mind.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 8:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: When you talk about the accommodations, it is important to note that options vary between on-campus and off-campus choices. Some students prefer on-campus housing, while others opt for off-campus arrangements. The decision often hinges on factors such as expenses, available facilities, the community of students, food choices, and other personal preferences. Recognizing the significance of comfort in their chosen environment for higher education, Galgotias University offers students the flexibility to make this choice.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 8:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: On the same note, when you analyze the expenses, students or parents are responsible for covering these costs. However, as you may recall from our initial discussions, the annual cost of a degree education in India typically ranges from $6000 to $8000. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you have qualified for a scholarship on your tuition fee, substantially reducing your overall education costs to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This amount includes not only your tuition fees but also accommodation fees, food costs, and basic amenities such as 24/7 wifi, electricity, and water bills.\n",

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.\n",

      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Good to hear it lessons our burdens\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I liked that thank you for that program\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Understood it is divided just like when we paid $350\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: That will ease our pockets\n",

      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Provide more information\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 647 4974: How many points are considered for a student to be elligible\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Ok noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes i understand\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope your query has been answered with the message above?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes answered\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 647 4974: He will work harder so as not to fall into that category\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is really good to know however, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Very clear\n",

      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Clear\n",

      "Extracted message: 21/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree.\n",
      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Understood\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 647 4974: So this means if he want to stay at compus it means $900 tuition fee plus $2000 accomodation to make a total of $2900 per semester\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please this is correct, and we will discuss more on this later on. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.\n",
      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes together\n",

      "Extracted message: 27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?\n",

      "Extracted message: 25/08/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/08/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Clear\n",

As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.\n",

Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750.

When ever she buys new stock she always turns up to me so I can help her to record and make sure we price the new stock in a way that will give us some profits. I also think that as someone who works in the business sector we have to be able to convince customers using the sweet business language.

Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that's clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.\n",

      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky I understand no questions so far\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your \"Earn While You Learn\" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 459 2418: I am done\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes yes very clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yeah you may continue it's still as clear as daylight\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No you may continue\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Please provide me with the Information\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky it's now clear thanks\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that's true\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes true\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 385 2216: I have reviewed them. Let's proceed\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 385 2216: Wow meaning my place will be already secured before everyone else applies\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 385 2216: Yes it resonates with me\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 385 2216: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 385 2216: Yes I understand two payments after a month is better will do that\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 385 2216: No iam not aware of this process you can provide the  information\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800.

Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 25/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",

It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?\n",

      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:02 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1350, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:04 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes clear ... following\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes following\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:00 pm - +27 64 208 8655: So I will pay $1600 plus $1000 for the first year?\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, it is not it will be adjusted meaning only you will be paying $1600. Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well.\n",
      "Extracted message: 18/11/23, 1:07 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thank you ..same to you\n",

      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:05 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm not getting you\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:06 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per the cost of education that was offered, it ranged from $2,000 to $3,000. Do you recall?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:07 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Offered to me or?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. May I know if you are recalling your counseling sessions?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:13 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to heart that. When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes following\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: To save at least $850\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I agree\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.\n",

Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 20/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050.

      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Okay\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes l have followed\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes l would like you provide more information\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes l am now clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes l agree\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 378 4298: Yes l am clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*\n",
      "Extracted message: 09/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",

      "Extracted message: 10/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum\n",

      "Extracted message: 10/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university.

As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established.

From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences.

Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",

Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?\n",

      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Let's proceed\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?\n",
      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 pm.

      "Extracted message: 16/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good evening sorry l had challenge of electricity and network because of heavy rains we received.  We can start if you are available.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I'm here and ready to proceed with the session.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Answer number 1\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes it's clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 456 2494: This one is also good. But l think it's good to have good A level pass\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Now, let us move forward to the last point,\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok.\n",

      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok it's clear\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Sure yes if it is 100% because get US dollars is a  problem and will be very difficult in few months to get it.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Tavonga's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course.

      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 456 2494: I understand. I'm residing in Bulawayo.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.\n",

This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.\n",

Right Name, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes understood\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.\n",
      "Extracted message: 17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?\n",

      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Yes\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Law\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Legislative Law\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 374 9598: That's correct...thank you\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Yes ...we can\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 374 9598: So in that case is well be possible for one to choose\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, and we will be there to guide you through the process and help you choose the right university of your choice. May I know if you are clear here?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Very much clear thank you\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted so may l ask that in the event of failing to meet there requirements on out come of Alevel is there a refund on that 500-1000 fee\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to if the A level turns out to be unsuccessful meaning failed?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Exactly\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you have any concerns that you might lead to this scenario, dear?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Just wanted to know if we came across to that what would happen\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, we would be able to provide you with various options available with Edoofa, as we value your career and grades as a student. For now, you don't need to worry about that. May I know if that is clear to you?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Very much clear now  we can proceed\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Yes we are on the same page\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 374 9598: What about the $1000 for registration\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1350 , In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350  as per the above example.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Noted\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your \"Earn While You Learn\" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 374 9598: No questions\n",
      "Extracted message: 14/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have no query, now, that you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2025 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2024 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well.\n",
