24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
24/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 149 3054: Yes l am confident
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 149 3054: No didnt
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 149 3054: Ok
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 149 3054: Ok
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tanaka I was reviewing your application above you mentioned that you are not aware if your parents will able to manage or not, and now you are saying they can because I can also understand for being parents and there occupation as vendors there might be fluctuations in the income so, have you thoroughly discussed about the remaining expenses with or not

24/11/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Friday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
