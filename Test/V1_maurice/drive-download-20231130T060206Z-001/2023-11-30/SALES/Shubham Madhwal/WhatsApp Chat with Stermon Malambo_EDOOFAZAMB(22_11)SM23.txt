23/11/23, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Luyanda?*
23/11/23, 11:17 am - +260 97 6182543: 1) My motivation to apply for Adoofa scholarship program is due to the fact that all  adoofians are pursuing their careers with a wide range of opportunities offered by the scholarship program.Not only that the program make it possible for African students as in my case to go and study my dream career offered by best schools in India despite having financial challenges.I was also motivated to apply for this program because of Love, care and support the adoofian's mentor they offer to the students.This proves enough the ground of Guardianship.
23/11/23, 11:37 am - +260 97 6182543: Our discussion was quite interesting, firstly I understood that the program mainly help the deserving students (such as upper six students, former A level students even lower six).Apart from that I came to know that the program is not 100% sponsorship. However,there is also a perspective of earn while you learn which enables students to self finance their education and career.The program unlocks the great potential in various scholars with a view to  imparting skills, knowledge and confidence in students for their preparations to participate in the global arena
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 6182543: Yes
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

*Please let me know once you have added them*

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
23/11/23, 10:34 pm - +260 96 3408171: Well 
As the father for Stermon Malambo, let say just a little on how much I know Edoofa while already appreciating the programs such as the Scholarship on offer and the services you as an Institution provide to learners, 
In a nutshell let me just say I say yes for the programs and services you are about to offer my son.
Go ahead and help him by unlocking set backs in order for him to attain greatness for programs, services and any other related issues related to scholarship alongside it.
For me I agree,
