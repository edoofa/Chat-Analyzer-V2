Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
23/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 723 1295: Oky go ahead

23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Chimhowa @263732428998 @263773512301 
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
23/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:24 am - +263 73 242 8998: My name is Godfrey Chimhowa. I am forty eight years old having been born on 14 July 1975. I am the father to Shalom Chimhowa. We are both christians and we believe in God. I was from a peasant rural background and studied upto 'O' Level and passed.  I then proceeded to study at Mutare Polytechnic College for a certificate in Business studies for one year, and proceeded to study for a further two years and graduated with a Diploma in  Business Accountancy. I then enrolled for a Higher National Diploma in Business Accountancy which is equivalent to a Bachelor degree in Accounting. I also enrolled at Zimbabwe Open University and graduated with an Executive Diploma in Business Leadership. I then worked in various organizations as clerk,  and Accounting positions before I was employed by my current employer, a subsidiary of a government department specializing in taxation and customs administration. I was employed first as a trainee cadet and I am a Revenue officer. During this period of employment I have interacted with various students at the country's borders and airports as they depart to study abroad and also as they return. As part of my job and as a team I have facillited the smooth arrival and clearance of students '  personal effects such as personal clothes and baggage  as well there new acquisitions such as personal vehicles to enter the country duty free as part of free rebates granted by the government. 
This is when I first admired how good it was for a child to work and study well so that one can study abroad and still come back home to work for the good of the country. I was motivated most when parents, relatives and guardians would wait jovially at airports to receive their child who would be coming after a period away studying. The reunion was and is always fantastic. I wished that one day one of my child would be studying abroad and lift the country and world flag high as a good ambassador.  As today I have no doubt that my child Shalom Chimhowa will be a good ambassador. She is well behaved and she is willing to learn. We as a family will support her to study in the best way possible.
Her mother Charity is a nurse here in Zimbabwe. She has come face to face with the suffering of the general public as they try to access health care. We are united as we support our family to study and work hard. The Edoofa program is the best way to go for our child. Our combined income as parents will provide a better benchmark to support her even as the grant will be 50% or higher. Recently I have witnessed a rise in the number of students studying abroad and going to India in particular. In short I pen off saying godbless to all the facillitators and students.
24/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 723 1295: Good morning everyone
24/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 73 242 8998: Good day good morning

24/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 723 1295: I was raised in a family of 5, 4 girls and a boy. My sister who is the biggest of us all is doing nurse aid and  she is followed by my brother who is now completing his degree in fuels and energy. As for me l'm still about to complete my A level next year and I'm in a science class. Last year I wrote my O level exams and l excelled with flying colours. As for the courses, l would like to do Biomedical engineering or BPharm. My parents are all well educated and both of them are employed. My father graduated and have a diploma in Executive Business Leadership and my mother have a diploma in Nursing. Both of them support me in terms of my school fees and they're all willing to support me up until l complete my studies abroad. I'm currently learning at Sakubva 1 High which is located in Manicaland province. As for fees we pay $200 per term. I also have two younger siblings who are all learning at a boarding school.

24/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 723 1295: For the last 4years l learned at St Augustine's high where l did my O level. This was a nice and brilliant school where l gained a lot of experience with a lot of things. This school made me who l am today because of its descipline. I also gained experience on how to be independent and not only to relay on my parents on whatever l want to do since it was a boarding school. At this stage this was when l learnt to fix my own problems and to do my own agenders without my parents being involved.My physical state was also groomed since we were involved in a lot of sporting activities such as tennis, swimming and basketball which was my favorite. I also gained confidence in myself since we met different kids from different backgrounds.. A lot of subjects were done including Mathematics, French, English, Computers only to mention a few and Mathematics was my favorite subject. The fees there where a bit high and we paid $500 per term excluding pocket money and groceries. Not forgetting my current school Sakubva 1 high, Centre of Excellence . It is well-known for competing for the lst or 2nd position with its A level results. It only accommodate those who are serious with their school work and l am very glad with that. I have had a lot of experiences which inspired me a lot throughout this period.

I have grew up to be a girl child with principals and manners through my childhood and high school experience. I am now someone who is responsible and very careful with the decisions make in life.
