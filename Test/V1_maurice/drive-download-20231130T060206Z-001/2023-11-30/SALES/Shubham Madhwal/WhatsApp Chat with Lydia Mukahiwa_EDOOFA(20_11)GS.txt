20/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 590 6860: Thank you, Sir
20/11/23, 11:57 am - Sagar: Alright, so Mrs. Gatsi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Rufaro, is that correct?
20/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 590 6860: Yes and there was someone called Reece
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Rufaro, also do tell me whether you learnt about Rufaro’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I was given a group link to join so that I can apply for my daughter to be considered for the scholarship programme so I just grabbed the opportunity to apply and I remember in that they sent us some photos from an event which had been held at Dominican Convent in Hre and there was a document which was sent in the group in which the programme is being used to fund other students to go to school like St Davids Bonda, St Albert's and so on.
20/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sagar: Noted.
20/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sagar: Now let me brief you about the program myself.
20/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 12:09 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Lydia so that just like these students she can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards her higher education by herself and help her parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes that what I'm looking for
20/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I'm single mother taking care of 2 children singlehandedly
20/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sagar: Great, Is Lydia available for the session?
20/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Currently she is writing her Ordinary Level results, she is at a boarding school she is finishing her examinations next week on 30 November
20/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Noted.
20/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: Okay so Mrs. Gatsi, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
20/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 590 6860: By the grace of the Lord I'm confident I have what it takes to meet those two significant metrics.
20/11/23, 12:28 pm - Sagar: Alright so Mrs.Gatsi, I would like to know you better as a parent, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish Lydia to study, her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your work (Place) in your country or any other country that you have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do you specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
20/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 590 6860: My name you already know I was born in a family of 5 children both my parents are still alive and look upon me financially and I'm the only one who lives in Harare formally employed I'm the 4th born, I'm a christian I was married and both my children are from that union though we later separated, i studied Pensions management in College and currently employed in the Public Service Commission in Zimbabwe as a Pensions Officer, I have an Honours degree on Insurance and Risk management, Lydia is an intelligent girl at grade 7 she came out highest in class with 5 units I didn't want anything to disturb her studies that's why I looked for a boarding place so that she could excell in her school work, I just hope she  passes her Ordinary Level examinations, she is self motivated like me, enjoys reading, she loves music and dancing and loves to be independant
20/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: So Mrs.Gatsi, could you kindly tell me how much *St Paul's Musami* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Lydia is in the Sciences class at St Paul's High School and was paying $540usd per term, when I was employed by the Public Service Commission, Pensions Agency on 23 October 2013, I was an Office assistant and had 6 Ordinary level passes at High school when I sat for the paper in year 2000, so for me to afford to care for my children I had to upgrade my education, I started by writing Mathematics paper at Ordinary level in 2014 and passed I was doing both going to school and working at the same time, i enrolled for night school with Harare Polytechnic College in 2015 and obtained a Certificate in Pensions Management I passed and was promoted at work to be a Pensions Assistant in 2016, that same year in August I enrolled with Midlands State University and started my honours degree in insurance and risk management weekend classand finished the programme in July 2019 and graduated, I financed myself because my children were still young and at Primary school level plus I would work overtime at work it was tough but by grace of the Lord I managed to pull through and pass. Right now fees for  Lydia were taking a toll on me because I had to take loans from banks to finance her education life is now tough and the salaries are not enough to cover for the costs that's why I looked for a scholarship so that I can be able to send her younger brother to a good school
20/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: I admire your spirit to complete your studies while working and self-financing that too.
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction, you did not mention the course, Lydia would like to study, could you please share that and what motivates her behind this field of study?
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Well she wants to be a Pharmacist as I have mentioned earlier that she is doing Sciences and she told me personally but I believe if she passes well she would want to become a doctor
20/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I had no option but to study hard and take care of my children though it was tough
20/11/23, 1:33 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 590 6860: From my side she is going to be the first one but from her father's side her uncle owns a pharmacy and has a child who is a pharmacist
20/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: Alright so now can you share Lydia's O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation? <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 590 6860: She is writing her Ordinary Level examinations this year I believe I would send them to you next year when the results are published in January
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sagar: Can you send me her form 4 term results then?
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok will send when she comes back from school next week on 30 November
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Thank you Sir
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sagar: You can send me the results in the chat too if possible?
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 590 6860: The report is in booklet form and every parent has to sign each term as a form of acknowledgement and return it to the school when they open
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 590 6860: So I don't have it right now
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sagar: Do you remember the grades?
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 590 6860: What I know is she did not do well in physics, maths and chemistry she had Ds and had to pay for extra lessons during the August holiday
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Sagar: Well  Mrs Gatsi as you mentioned that it is your desire that Lydia studies medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sagar: But I realize that you want to make her do a course that makes her parent proud and also align with her passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*Diploma in Medical Lab Technology*

This course has lesser duration than Medicine and is more affordable for students. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Beautiful so I believe she will like the course let's just wait for the results then.
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 590 6860: And for her to make her decision
20/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: Should I brief you about the course?
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes go ahead Sir
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: *Diploma in Medical Lab Technology*

20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: Medical Laboratory Technician: Medical Laboratory Technician has the job of labelling, Receiving and analysing samples like blood, tissue and toxic. This job also involves designing and executing laboratory testing with the standard testing procedure.
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 590 6860: They are the ones who carry out experiments in laboratories
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Sagar: Yes they do the testing in the laboratories.
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Beautiful
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: Did you understand the course?
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes I understood and the qualifications what do they require for this Diploma
20/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Uuuuuum is this question directed to me or Lydia
20/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok I will answer
20/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sagar: You can answer for her.
20/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 590 6860: She would be analysing bodily fluids and tissues for proper diagnosis and treatment of diseases usually technicians work behind the scenes researching and advancing the medical field, she will be more like working hand in hand with the physician to diagonise and treat diseases so in 5 years time through the scholarship programme my daughter would be more than the doctor because she would be the one  researching and coming out with solutions on how to treat patients waal this is amazing she can be able to finance herself and advance to a degree programme and she can be independent and be able to care for her needs lessening the financial burden on me through Edoofa Scholarship programme
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: That is really great Mrs Gatsi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is Lydia willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way inorder to transform her career?
20/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Uuuuuuuum I'm more than grateful for what you have shown me today this Diploma is amazing
20/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I think I need to guide her and take her through this diploma so she can make a better choice
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want her to study abroad and not in your country?
20/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 590 6860: If you are able to sponsor her here in Zimbabwe I would be happy.
20/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I thought you only sponser students if they are studying in India
20/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct, we do prefer to give scholarships to students who are studying in India, but you need to understand why is that, the superior education and the vast opportunities that students get here is why we want the students to study here.
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 590 6860: So I prefer she studies in India were she can be able to do her Diploma in the rightful place with vast opportunities and resources
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have Lydia maximum exposure in her life because of which you are planning to make her study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity for Lydia to pursue her higher education through this scholarship, how is she planning to contribute her learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 590 6860: There are so many children in Zimbabwe who are academically gifted it's only that you are in India I would have  loved to take a tour with you in those areas, i wish she could just select those academically gifted ones and sponser their education she would have given back to society or even to open and school and cater for everyone in the society or even start a college majoring in medical technicians or clinical technicians she would have developed something big in the education system of the country by imparting what she would have learned in India to those in Zimbabwe
20/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mrs Gatsi, but in order to do that for Lydia she would have to study with her utmost dedication which would only be possible if she will have a conducive environment around her. 

Don’t you agree?
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes I agree and the conducive environment is in India
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sagar: Yes Mrs Gatsi, that is correct.
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
20/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes why is it so because me personally I admire your culture
20/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: And we admire yours Mrs.Gatsi
20/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 590 6860: It's deeply rooted in unity of families and religion
20/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
20/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

I hope this message finds you all in the best of your spirits.
21/11/23, 9:33 am - Sagar: So are you available for the session?
21/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 590 6860: Morning how are you Sir
21/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 590 6860: Yes
21/11/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: I am fine Mrs Gatsi.
21/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: So now Mrs Gatsi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
21/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 590 6860: You did not specify on the duration of the Diploma
21/11/23, 10:08 am - Sagar: Mrs.Gatsi, the duration of the diploma is mentioned in the first paragraph of the program description itself and it is for 3 years, did you not read the brief?
21/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 590 6860: My apologies I think I was too excited about the course
21/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 590 6860: I have no other questions
21/11/23, 10:14 am - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
21/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 590 6860: No Lydia would be the first one to move abroad can you kindly share with me the costs involved  for a student without scholarship
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 590 6860: Interesting does the scholarship cover transport costs
21/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 590 6860: Are there employment opportunities whilst the student is studying
21/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 590 6860: It's affordable I'm happy
21/11/23, 10:31 am - Sagar: Can you please elaborate the question?
21/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 590 6860: Does the scholarship cover airfare from Zimbabwe to India
21/11/23, 10:33 am - Sagar: Yes Mrs.Gatsi, the University holds a campus placement drive in the final year, which gives a lot of employment opportunities to our students, also being already skilled in essential skills required for future jobs through our EWYL program will help the students to secure a job.
21/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 590 6860: Thank you so much it helps again in easing the financial burden she would be independent
21/11/23, 10:36 am - Sagar: Mrs Gatsi, the cost of travelling to India is a one-time expense that has to be born by you, but the Edoofa program still makes sure that you are assisted in all your visa applications and the travel to India.
21/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 590 6860: Ok I understand
21/11/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: In simple words Mrs Gatsi what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 590 6860: It's way more affordable than even in Zimbabwe
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: Yes Mrs Gatsi, that is correct.
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 590 6860: I'm thrilled so what payment platform would I be using to pay for tuition from Zimbabwe to India
21/11/23, 10:52 am - Sagar: Please lets continue the session, your question will be addressed ahead.
21/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 590 6860: Ok thanks
21/11/23, 11:00 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
21/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 590 6860: Yes go ahead Sir
21/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: Mrs. Gatsi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
21/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 590 6860: She is doing computer science as well I believe this would be an eye opener to her
21/11/23, 11:08 am - Sagar: Yes that is correct.
21/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 590 6860: Yes they need to be fully equipped inorder for them to face the real world and it's challenges
21/11/23, 11:08 am - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/11/23, 11:08 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
21/11/23, 11:08 am - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

21/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 590 6860: Uuuuuum I have learnt a lot about Edoofa scholarships and it's interesting so when are you coming to Zimbabwe so that we can see you explain all of this in person
21/11/23, 11:25 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
21/11/23, 11:25 am - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
21/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 590 6860: Yes my girl's life after completing her education would be inspiring to others just like what I have seen above and you are ever encouraging them to work hard which good because it yields good results wherever they go they would be recognized as an edoofian
21/11/23, 12:20 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Mrs.Gatsi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
21/11/23, 12:21 pm - Sagar: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I hope she will earn as much as possible those scholarship credits
21/11/23, 12:47 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sagar: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding Lydia's international education? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Thats what I want I hope she will be able to self-sponser herself
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 590 6860: That's exactly what I have been looking for
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sagar: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sagar: Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sagar: While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
21/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Thats very true
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 590 6860: That's why I'm looking for sponsorship because I cannot afford to send my child to a tertiary school
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sagar: Alright Mrs.Gatsi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members and you would be the ones who would be supporting Lydia for her higher education.
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I would be responsible for supporting her my family members are looking up to me
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes I'm ready
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Network is the problem
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: Mrs.Gatsi as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 590 6860: $1500-$2250 would be spent
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: Exactly Mrs.Gatsi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750
21/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok I understand
21/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
21/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
21/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I'm listening go on
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: NAME basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: However Mrs.Gatsi, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok i know to raise such an amount in a short space of time is hectic
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: That is why the plan to give payment in two halves exist Mrs Gatsi.
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes still connected
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 590 6860: It's fine
21/11/23, 2:22 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
21/11/23, 2:22 pm - Sagar: Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 590 6860: No I'm not familiar with it
21/11/23, 2:35 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: Stage 5
Alright Mrs Gatsi, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
21/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sagar: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
21/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sagar: Stage 6

Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 590 6860: No questions
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
22/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Hello how are you I'm Lydia's mother
22/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?

22/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Does the scholarship have a deadline
22/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Isn't it supposed to cater for the child until she has finalised her diploma
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on the question so that I can help you understand the same better?
22/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 590 6860: A deadline for helping out students  cater for their educational needs whilst they are still going to school
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: By securing a scholarship now, @263775906860 you ensure financial support for Lydia's higher education, which is to reduce the burden of tuition costs. This will allow your child to focus more on their studies without the stress of financial constraints. Additionally, reserving a scholarship seat early offers ample time for preparation for you as parents, ensuring they meet all requirements and excel in their final year of high school. It's a proactive step that not only eases the financial aspect but also provides peace of mind, giving your child the opportunity to fully concentrate on their education and future prospects.
22/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok so does the scholarship cover  the duration of the diploma or it partly covers for the duration of them diploma
22/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the scholarship will cover the entire duration of the  diploma please!
22/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Thank you

22/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 590 6860: 7. Very very clear
22/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263775906860*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
22/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263775906860* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Lydia* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Lydia's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
22/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I'm grateful and you too thank you for your patience
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *28th or 29th of November 2023* for $200 and the *28th or 29th of December 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *28th or 29th of November 2023*
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Right now I cannot afford why don't you move to January or February 2024
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on the isssue you are facing?
22/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Deep financial burden her younger brother is enrolling for form 1 next year so I would be paying his fees in December 2023 for first term next year
22/11/23, 5:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you do not mind me asking, May  I know the amount you would be paying for the form 1 registration fees in December?
22/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 590 6860: I need about 500usd to ba safe for fees
22/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I totally understand please!
22/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Thank you Sir
22/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As a Senior Academician at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your child's education and guide you through the details of our scholarship program. We understand that ensuring your child receives a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for Lydia's brighter future.
22/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Following
22/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.
22/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes especially in Africa the only option would be to be an entrepreneur
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I help you create a financial plan so that you can complete the formalities and Enroll Lydia in the scholarship program as well so that she does not miss out on the opportunity, Since the number of scholarship are limited in number. So I do not  want you too risk the opportunity for the same!
22/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes please
22/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Ms Mellania*, @263775906860 as you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, to your situation and since Lydia has cleared the required set of eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you would have to *complete a part fee of $100, Ie 29th of November*. That if Lydia can be found selected for the program
22/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You would have time till the 29th of  December, to complete another $100, and then the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 20 days which would be around the 15th of December 2023.  All in all, for $350 you will have about 55 days to complete the formalities.

Considering your situation, I believe this financial plan would be convenient for you and your family, please?
22/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Ok will see what happens if I don't meet the deadline
22/11/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: There is a reason that we have provided this 7 day period, which is that the number of applicants for the scholarship is more than 1000 on a daily basis and the number of seats is limited, So if In case the student when selected after the interview fails to provide the enrollment fees on time, Then there will be no extension as it will block a seat for some another student, We are the leading scholarship providing organization to Meritorious students of Africa and we do not want that the deserving students miss on this opportunity, I hope you understand!
22/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 590 6860: Yes I understand I will try to meet the deadline
22/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263775906860* are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case *Lydia* gets selected into the program?

*Please answer in a Voice note format*
22/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 590 6860: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775906860 As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counselling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
