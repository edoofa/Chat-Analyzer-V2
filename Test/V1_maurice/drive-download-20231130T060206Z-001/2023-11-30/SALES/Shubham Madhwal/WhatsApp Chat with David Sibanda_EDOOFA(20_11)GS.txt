21/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 406 6663: What's going on here???
21/11/23, 9:58 am - Sagar: Good Morning David Sibanda, Mrs. Elisa Makhese!

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for David from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sagar: Hi David Sibanda, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Sagar: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm Ghana Time Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

22/11/23, 10:10 am - Sagar: I am fine David.
22/11/23, 10:11 am - Sagar: Alright, so David, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, is that correct?
22/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
22/11/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Takunda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
22/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 489 4538: No , he didn't tell me about his journey
But ,that Edoofa was founded for students to be able to take their first step , through studying abroad . He also emphasized that ,they help you in Visa application, providing plane ticket as well as providing comfortable accommodation
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Sagar: Noted.
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Sagar: Now let me brief you about the program.
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/11/23, 10:27 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes it is
22/11/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: Okay so Jonathan, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
22/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
22/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
22/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
22/11/23, 11:14 am - Sagar: Alright so Jonathan, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

22/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sagar: David, it is totally commendable that you wish to pursue your education by putting an extra effort by doing part-time jobs and reducing the financial burden from your parents. Still, after the scholarship, there would be finances involved, which you and your family would have to cater to. So is your family willing to support you for the same financially?

22/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes sir
22/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes 
Can you brief about it ?
22/11/23, 3:57 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

22/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Ooh that's wonderful
22/11/23, 4:08 pm - Sagar: So now David, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes I understood

Are Edoofians enrolled in different areas over the country
22/11/23, 4:12 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 489 4538: No 

I just know that it costs a lot , but not specifically
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Okay noted sir
22/11/23, 4:19 pm - Sagar: In simple words David what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>

Noted
22/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Does Edoofa helps students in Visa application
22/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct, the students are provided with assistance for VISA apllications.
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 489 4538: How many minimum points are needed for students enrollment
22/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 489 4538: So the eligibility has not yet changed
22/11/23, 4:32 pm - Sagar: David, now the eligibility has been reduced to just two A-level passes.
22/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Ok noted
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
22/11/23, 4:35 pm - Sagar: David, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yeah

22/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

22/11/23, 4:41 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
22/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes 
it will
22/11/23, 4:47 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that David, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Ok yeah
I understood sir
22/11/23, 5:07 pm - Sagar: Well David, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care, address my question, and do watch the video I am sharing below.
https://youtu.be/R83JhMfNZfw

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/11/23, 8:17 am - Sagar: Greetings Everyone,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
23/11/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 489 4538: How are are you sir . Here am fine


Yes we can
23/11/23, 8:25 am - Sagar: I am fine,David.
23/11/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 489 4538: Great
23/11/23, 8:26 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 8:27 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes am  now Realising how you are different
23/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.
23/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
23/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
23/11/23, 9:26 am - Sagar: David, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant
23/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes ,I understand
23/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 489 4538: Who is the founder of Edoofa
23/11/23, 9:54 am - Sagar: Mr.Angad Singh is the founder of Edoofa.
23/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 489 4538: Okay
23/11/23, 10:01 am - Sagar: Alright David, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes they will
23/11/23, 10:07 am - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 489 4538: I just highlighted them
23/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
23/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: David as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 489 4538: $1500  to  $2250
23/11/23, 10:32 am - Sagar: Exactly David, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 10:32 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:32 am - Sagar: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes I see
23/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
23/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 489 4538: Yes I think so
23/11/23, 10:50 am - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 489 4538: You are welcome
23/11/23, 10:53 am - Sagar: David basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 10:53 am - Sagar: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
23/11/23, 10:53 am - Sagar: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
23/11/23, 10:53 am - Sagar: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 489 4538: Okay
23/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 489 4538: Noted
23/11/23, 11:09 am - Sagar: However David, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 489 4538: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 489 4538: Okay sir 
Noted
23/11/23, 12:10 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sagar: Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 489 4538: No am not 
What is it all about?
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Alright David, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
23/11/23, 12:31 pm - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
23/11/23, 12:31 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Okay yeah
Noted sir
23/11/23, 12:36 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 489 4538: I don't have questions by now .
23/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Sorry, how long does it take to go through all six stages
23/11/23, 12:47 pm - Sagar: David, It totally varies from student to student.
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Ok sir
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

What happens
28/11/23, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning @263784894538
28/11/23, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Well before I brief you about the same, can I ask you a question?
28/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes
28/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Morning
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: According to you is studying abroad a big decision or a small decision?
28/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 489 4538: A big decision
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so if you do agree with me that it is a big decision can you tell me whether this decision requires a student to be properly prepared for the journey ahead?
28/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes it needs a student to be prepared ahead
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Exactly @263784894538, so if we talk about what you asked, if a student is serious enough for the opportunity and aspires to study abroad, then what you shared is highly unlikely, yes if you would have meant to ask what would happen if a student needs some financial assistance to complete the formalities of $200 in 7 days then the question would have been different. 

Otherwise based on my experience, no serious student wouldn't be mentally and financially prepared, if they have been aspiring to study abroad.

I believe you wanted to ask what would happen if a parent faces financial challenges in those 7 days isn't it?
28/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Yes it is
28/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In such a case @263784894538 if a student needs assistance in completing the fee in due time, they are given extension based on their preparations please.
28/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Thank you sir
28/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 489 4538: Noted
28/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now would you like to ask anything else?
28/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 489 4538: No
29/11/23, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone,
