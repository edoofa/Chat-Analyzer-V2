20/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 715 9643: The law is a fascinating and complex area of study. It touches on so many different aspects of human life, from economics to philosophy to politics. I am particularly interested in the ways that law can be used to promote justice and equality for all people. I also find the process of legal argumentation and analysis to be intellectually stimulating. The law is constantly evolving, and I am eager to explore its many nuances and subtleties. Furthermore, I believe that my analytical skills and impartiality would be improved tremendously.I'd like to add that I see the practice of law as a way to help people navigate some of the most difficult and challenging situations in their lives. As a lawyer, I could provide guidance and support to those who are facing legal challenges, whether it be a criminal charge, a divorce, or a contract dispute. I find this aspect of the law particularly meaningful, as it allows me to make a real difference in people's lives. Ultimately, I believe that becoming a lawyer would allow me to use my skills and knowledge to help others and promote justice in the world.

Me

The objective of this course is to equip the students with an expert knowledge and a unique perspective on it. It enables the students to think critically in a creative way and come up with innovative ideas to tackle the aforesaid legal issues.

The students having an ability to draft formal documents with precision are perfect for this course. This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
20/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 715 9643: Okay
20/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 866 7501: Gd morning.... Law seems to be a vast field... which part would be best for Malebogo given the country we stay in and where to study
20/11/23, 1:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please according to me that would be international law!
20/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 866 7501: Let me try Google to understand more about it
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 866 7501: I believe and have faith that she will attain more than 2 Alevel passes
20/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's amazing, can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

God Bless You!
