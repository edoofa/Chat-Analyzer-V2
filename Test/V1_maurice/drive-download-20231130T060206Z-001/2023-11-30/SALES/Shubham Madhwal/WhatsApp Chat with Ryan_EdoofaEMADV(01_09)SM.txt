01/09/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: Well, to add up to your knowledge, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering *50-100% scholarships on tuition fees*. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/09/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.

With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we now look to close the 2023 academic year with 500 proud Edoofians of Zambia.
01/09/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others.

01/09/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: The Founders of the Edoofa Scholarship Program were invited by the Ministry of Education of your Country to appreciate the success of Edoofa Scholarships. 
You are lucky to get this chance based on the Forms filled by you.
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Ryan, so that just like these students he can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards his higher education by himself and help you, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/09/23, 11:50 am - +260 97 7408010: Yes  indeed.
01/09/23, 11:53 am - Sagar: Alright so Mrs Mwale, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Mwale better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education
01/09/23, 11:54 am - +260 97 7408010: Okay
01/09/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 7408010: I was born on the 25th May 1970, I went up to grade 12, my highest qualification is just Diploma in Human Resource Management. I also studied administrative management and International Diplomacy Protocol and Public Relations. I was working for the Brazilian Embassy till June 2022 when my contact was not renewed. I'm a house wife but also doing little businesses to try and help my husband. I have 5 children Ryan being the fourth child, 3 girls and two boys. Love interacting with people and enjoy travelling 💕. 

Knowledge is power and that's one thing no one can take that away from you. I keep telling my children to work hard at School focus and live better lives than mom send Dad. I'd love my son Ryan to go to a good university and be able to turn into a God fearing and upright citizen wherever he will choose to live in the world Zambia 🇿🇲 or wherever the Lord has destined him to be. I always tell my children you're moulding your life with your own hands faith the pen that u hold throughout your school life. It is the pen that will take them places I always say......The world is such a big place I'd love my Children to work hard so they can live where they want znd enjoy life with what it has to offer but this can only be attained by hard work, surrounding yourself with good friends and focus on School 🏫 because as parents you can only hold their hands for the period you are alive and let go when you disembark from the train of life. Hence motivating him Ryan to work hard and focus.
01/09/23, 12:27 pm - +260 97 7408010: My husband is in a meeting with Bank of Zambia 🇿🇲 they are the ones that regulate Banks in Zambia. He will be able to join us later and give us a brief biography of himself.

02/09/23, 10:22 am - +260 97 7408010: Ryan was born on 15th September 2006. He is the 4th born in a family of five children. He went to Damishel Christian Academy  from grade 1 to 7 then went to Holy Cross Convent where he did his grade 8 and 9. We moved him to a boarding School in his 10th grade and he is currently doing his 12 th grade at EMASS SCHOOL  where we learnt about Edoofa. His career aspiration is to be a mechanical engineer. He is good in Civic education, maths, has a big heart, his weaknesses are physics and additional mathematics but not permanent, he quickly gives up in argument he will say its passed kkkk.

His hobbies  cycling, learning about cars and loves watching National Geographic loves watching animals 😀. He loves Germany 🇩🇪 cars.

We have 3 girls and two boys. And 2 grand children aged 3 and 1 plus me and the father. We love our Sundays because that's a family day, we eat our meals together. Hubby is an IT person am an Administration person and our first born  studied at Cyprus International University and is currently working as Sales and Marketing manager at some company. We pray and eat together as a family. We believe family comes first and education also starts from there. Our hope is to see also our children be God fearing children and also morally upright children in their journey of life. We've also taught them to respect elders and encourage them to attend bible believing church and read the bible. 

My husband will also respond and Ryan is here also to answer questions.

I humbly submit
02/09/23, 10:27 am - +260 96 1242533: Good morning
Our sincere apology for the late response.
We have five children 3 girls and two boys. Ryan is the fourth in line. He started school quite young at Damishael  Christian Academy in Lusaka and went to grade 8 and nine at Hollycross Secondary school. At grade ten we decided that he goes to a boarding school and we settled for Emmass to maintain building the Christian faith besides his academic. Ryan has been a good child and very responsible. As parents we have provided support spiritual, mentally and of course financial. We are satisfied with his academic performance though some times he does not meet our expectations.
02/09/23, 10:29 am - +260 96 1242533: We are confident that he will do well in his grade 12 exams at the end of this year. As parents we shall support him and encourage him to do well in all spheres of his life.
02/09/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: Thank you for sharing more details about Ryan and your wonderful family. It's evident that you have a close-knit and loving family that values education, moral values, and togetherness. Ryan's interest in becoming a mechanical engineer and his hobbies like cycling and learning about cars show his passion for engineering and technology.
02/09/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: It's great to hear about your family's Sunday traditions and the importance you place on family time and faith. These are essential values that contribute to the overall development of children.
02/09/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Thank you for your response and no need to apologize for the delay. It's great to hear more about your family and Ryan's educational journey. Your support in all aspects of his life, including spiritual, mental, and financial, is truly commendable.

04/09/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: B.Tech. Mechanical : What is it about?

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
04/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 96 8651816: @919540301963  I appreciate the great insight shared for it has increased my wild endeavors to get to know more about the course sir.
04/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: I am glad to know that, Ryan
04/09/23, 2:36 pm - Sagar: Did you understand the course properly?
04/09/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 7408010: Yes sir (I'm currently using my Mom's phone for the meantime my phone ran flat)
04/09/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Alright, Ryan
04/09/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?

And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/09/23, 3:09 pm - +260 97 7408010: Well in the next five years I have dreamed of working for Mercedes-Benz as an engineer and hopefully becoming a manager as years to come 
Being prevallaged to get into your highly respected organisation can grant me the chance in pursuing dreams my dreams by pushing myself to get the best of me
04/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sagar: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Ryan

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
04/09/23, 3:14 pm - +260 97 7408010: Yes sir I would be pleased to, they say opportunity comes once and when it cometh your way you are sure to grab and secure that one opportunity that can later lead to success
04/09/23, 3:16 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/09/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 7408010: From my own understanding I believe studying abroad can expose me to high quality education and a new way of living can allow me to fulfil my ambitions and I feel Zambia hasn't yet got that standard of quality education for instance lack of leading vehicle manufacturer plants at the moment but I believe in working for a better tomorrow for Zambia once I'm done with my studies sir.
04/09/23, 3:51 pm - Sagar: *I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?*
04/09/23, 4:07 pm - +260 97 7408010: Yes I did 
I learnt Germany (is the world leader in innovations related to engineering),The USA(for being top in the automotive segment along side Germany) and United Kingdom(exemplary education courses and high quality manufacturing base) e.t.c all have quality education concerning the course I would like to obtain .
I haven't applied to any university abroad
04/09/23, 4:17 pm - Sagar: Alright, I understand that basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad, so if you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship which would help you have the kind of exposure you are aiming to have, Can you tell me about how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/09/23, 4:42 pm - +260 96 8651816: In Hope's of obtaining greater insight in the productivity industry in engineering I have planned on opening a junior engineering club to educate young people on engineering and offer basically the practical steps one needs to follow
04/09/23, 4:42 pm - Sagar: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!

04/09/23, 4:45 pm - +260 96 8651816: Thank you for your time sir
Hope's in hearing from you tomorrow.
04/09/23, 4:58 pm - +260 97 7408010: Thank you Sir, for your time and a shot for Ryan to get an Edoofa Scholarship.

Pleasant evening 

Mrs. Bella Mwale.
05/09/23, 9:08 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

_"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go."_

 Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/09/23, 9:11 am - +260 96 8651816: Good morning to you sir
05/09/23, 9:14 am - +260 97 7408010: Good morning Sir, am on my way to Chipata in Eastern province of Zambia 🇿🇲 am on a bus so network will be intermittent but iv asked the father to keep an eye here, just that he is the IT manager of First Alliance Bank and it gets hectic for him....
05/09/23, 9:14 am - +260 97 7408010: All the best Ryan 🩷🩷
05/09/23, 9:22 am - Sagar: Good morning! Thank you for the update, and I appreciate your efforts to stay connected despite the network challenges. Please take your time, and when you and the father have any questions or information to share, feel free to reach out. Safe travels to Chipata, and I look forward to assisting you both with any inquiries or discussions you have regarding education and career opportunities.
05/09/23, 9:22 am - Sagar: @260968651816 I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
05/09/23, 9:29 am - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir, indeed utmost dedication is required inclusive of a conducive environment which acts as a catalyst to help to achieve greater heights.
05/09/23, 9:34 am - Sagar: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
05/09/23, 10:15 am - +260 96 8651816: India has surely proven to me that it has a really strong back bone of successful people and there is no doubt about it. It would be an honor to learn in a country like India which hosts the third largest education in the world and obtain innovational traits obtained by their own successful people.
05/09/23, 10:21 am - Sagar: It's wonderful to hear your appreciation for India's rich educational landscape and the accomplishments of its people.
05/09/23, 10:21 am - Sagar: May I know if you understood everything properly?
05/09/23, 10:37 am - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir I did, thank you.
05/09/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/09/23, 11:20 am - +260 97 7408010: No I'm personally not aware.
05/09/23, 11:22 am - +260 96 8651816: I'm not quite certain sir
05/09/23, 11:24 am - +260 97 7408010: Only Govt sponsored scholarship are fully paid for
05/09/23, 11:24 am - +260 97 7408010: There's a portion which family has to pay. Yes we are aware
05/09/23, 11:26 am - +260 97 7408010: From my husband he is in a meeting with Bank of Zambia which is the Central Bank and all banks regulator
05/09/23, 11:33 am - Sagar: Alright, please.
05/09/23, 11:33 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
05/09/23, 11:33 am - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/09/23, 11:34 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 11:45 am - +260 96 1242533: Ok thats understandable and affordable
05/09/23, 11:46 am - Sagar: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
05/09/23, 12:10 pm - +260 97 7408010: 🫣😩 yoh
05/09/23, 12:11 pm - +260 97 7408010: This sounds interesting yes please can you brief the Mwale's we are all ears and anticipating
05/09/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/09/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/09/23, 12:31 pm - +260 97 7408010: Wow this is so commendable of you. They not only get educated by you but also job on training and get paid for that, wow. This is really a unique aspect of the program 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾😍
05/09/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 7408010: I may in in a bus but pray my Son Ryan gets into Edoofa 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
05/09/23, 12:34 pm - Sagar: Yes, ma'am.
05/09/23, 12:35 pm - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/09/23, 12:35 pm - Sagar: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/09/23, 12:35 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
05/09/23, 12:45 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes it is absolutely amazing how this program works to provide sustainability in all areas sir.
05/09/23, 12:48 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
05/09/23, 12:48 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/09/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7408010: I know Ryan has answered but as a mother I feel this Scholarship is the best especially with the EWYL and I love Asians you are serious with School no wonder even back here in Zambia Asians excel in academics. The bank my Husband works for is owned by an Indaian man. Mr. Sam Patel. Please afford my son this Scholarship he will turn out into a fine young man coupled with EMASS that has trained his head, heart and hands.

This is a chance in a life time even when he gets onto employment I see him excelling at the place of work with the programs and the EWLyY
05/09/23, 12:54 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir I'm ready
05/09/23, 1:03 pm - Sagar: Thank you for expressing your appreciation for the scholarship opportunity and the Edoofa program. It's clear that you have a strong belief in the value of education and are eager to see your son, Ryan, excel in his academic and career pursuits.
05/09/23, 1:05 pm - +260 97 7408010: Yes indeed as is my husband just that it's hectic for him at the bank right now as they are being audited by Central Bank
05/09/23, 1:10 pm - +260 97 7408010: It's every parents dream to see their child/Children excel in the school and tertiary education so that they are able to fend for themselves and look after us hopefully in our old age lol 😁😌🙏🏾😍💃🏾
05/09/23, 1:12 pm - Sagar: Absolutely, seeing one's children excel in their education and future endeavors is a dream shared by parents around the world. It's a testament to your love and dedication as parents to provide the best opportunities for your children.
05/09/23, 1:13 pm - Sagar: Ryan as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/09/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7408010: This message was deleted
05/09/23, 1:25 pm - +260 96 8651816: If one applies at a university which costs $300 it is $1500 which is approximately k30,519.48 kwacha equivalent and if it costs $450 per application a student is required to spend $2,250 which kwacha equivalent is k46,093.39.
05/09/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 7408010: MAY I BE EXCUSED WE ARE IN BETWEEN TOWNS BUT EVERY SO OFTEN IIL BE PEEPING
05/09/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: Alright, please.
05/09/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/09/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 1:45 pm - +260 96 8651816: With no negotiations required that is an astounding amount for a university student to pay for which it is as paying for a primary/secondary student  back here sir 🙂.
05/09/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
05/09/23, 1:50 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir, I do believe so
05/09/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 7408010: Wow 🙏🏾😍💃🏾💃🏾🥳🥳🥳
05/09/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Ryan basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sagar: @260968651816 are we connected?
05/09/23, 2:43 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir
05/09/23, 2:50 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
05/09/23, 2:52 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir I understand it fully now.
05/09/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself. <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/09/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 7408010: Am equally following Sir.
05/09/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/09/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$750) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
05/09/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/09/23, 3:06 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 7408010: Following
05/09/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 7408010: Following
05/09/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 7408010: 👍🏾
05/09/23, 3:08 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir
05/09/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/09/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/09/23, 3:12 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* I would be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.
