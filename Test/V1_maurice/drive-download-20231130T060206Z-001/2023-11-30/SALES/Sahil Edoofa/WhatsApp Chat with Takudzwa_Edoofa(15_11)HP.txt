15/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Ok well noted and understood
15/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Thats exactly what am looking for.

15/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Am not that much aware of that?Hope i will be one of them
15/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: I hope it's exciting to know the same now, Takudzwa?

15/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
15/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 932 0941: They are fully behind me and aware of my plans to study abroad bdca they want the best out of me and they know i have the potential
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: It's great that they are supportive, Takudzwa.
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 932 0941: I get it Ms. Harmehak
And am very confident to aim for the maximum points
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: That's good, Takudzwa.
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine, Takudzwa?
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 932 0941: I had 5 A’s and 6B’s including an A in Biology
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Do address the other part, Takudzwa
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 932 0941: I grew a passion and anxiety of wanting to understand each and every on how the human body functions.
The wide dynamic drove me into this having to find more knowledge on what the designed model of the human body is
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: I can see you are intrigued towards learning more and that's great, Takudzwa.
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: So why didn't you pursue Physics in your A level, Takudzwa?

I believe it's a crucial subject, isn't it?
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Yes i do believe the something but doing something its all about passion, you havr to take time and discover what you want to do in life and then research on the requirements of what you want to do so as not to regret later.
So i discovered my passion in liking what to do with the human body and did research and saw that it linked with Biology.
Then grew and gave my time to grow passion in Biology
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Takudzwa.

However let me share the requirements with you.
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 932 0941: That will be worth taking
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 932 0941: So i guess i meet the mandatory subjects since i also do Chemistry to add on to Biology
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: Physics is required as well please.
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 932 0941: So on these programs Physics is not mandatory
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: No please, Takudzwa.

You are eligible for them as per your subject combination and they are closely related to your desired field.
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 932 0941: So which means i can persue them with my current combination

16/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Thank you for the enhancement of knowledge.
Noted with pleasure
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

You can go through the same and inform me.
16/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Okay i have gone through it and am excited to know more information about India
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Takudzwa 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 932 0941: No!
They are not familiar
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: I understand
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Oh okay noted 
Its my pleasure to know
16/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Thats is blessing !
It is really helpful and enough gratitude to them
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
16/11/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 932 0941: I guess the Earn While You Learn Program is very useful and helpful in reducing the costs.Thumbs up to this program
16/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Takudzwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Thats true !
The cost of living here is high
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now having gone through the cost are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Given the opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program as well.
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Absolutely its making the learning path for everyone very affordable and easily accessed by the less privileged students
Thumbs up to Edoofa
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through these resources and information, Takudzwa?
16/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 932 0941: It indeed a very crucial program to help the young students as they engage in their studies.I have read and understood it cleary
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Okay i will try my best
Usually the network will be giving me problems
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Takudzwa.
16/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Ooh okay understoood 
Noted
16/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

This is a really must take program
Thumbs up for this program!
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Takudzwa, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Yes i am
16/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Takudzwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Ooh so its not guaranteed even after paying that amount?
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: This is the case for students without Edoofa.
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: Please?
16/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Applying 5 universities would cost between *1500USD* to *2250USD*
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Sure
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Very affordable indeed
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Takudzwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Yeah i think so!
16/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Woow that very flexible and fair to the parents
16/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that
16/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Sure Ms.Harmehak
16/11/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 932 0941: They are clear and understandable very well 
Thank you
16/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

16/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Thats the formality of the visa
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Understood
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Do connect her with your parents too!

Are you aware that Senior Academician Mr Piyush, also visited your school while he was in Zimbabwe?
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 932 0941: No am not aware
16/11/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

He happened to take a seminar there for Upper 6 students.

Mr Sahil would be sharing pictures with you tomorrow as well.
16/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

17/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

21/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 932 0941: Yes we can
21/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: noted
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26TH or 27TH November 2023 for $200 and the 26TH or 27TH of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26TH or 27TH  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

23/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 913 8389: How are u Sir ,
Network problem ,
I went through your conversation and l acknowledge it go ahead.
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 913 8389: May l ask.
Our child is Form 5 ,we pay this year or next year when in form 6
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: This year for enrollment fees to reserve the seat
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Takudzwa's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
