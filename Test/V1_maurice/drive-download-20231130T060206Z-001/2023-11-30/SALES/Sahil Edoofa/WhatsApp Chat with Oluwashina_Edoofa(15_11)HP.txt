Edoofa provides students with the opportunity to gain practical experience through internships as well.
15/11/23, 5:17 pm - +234 704 103 0083: This is what I've learnt so far
15/11/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

15/11/23, 5:42 pm - +234 704 103 0083: When I messaged Edoofa on WhatsApp, I'm to fill a form so u can be connect to a senior counselor.
I believe that the form to to just connect me and not the scholarship form.
I plan to discuss this with my parents when I visit them next month.
15/11/23, 5:43 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I am sure it will be better than discussing it on a phone call.
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Oluwashina.
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Oluwashina, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I will start with my background.
My parents both obatain First Leaving School Certificate, my father is a driver and my mother is a trader.
I have three younger siblings which two of them are still in High school while the eldest completed his high school education in 2021. (Told you I'm the first child).

I completed my high school education in 2019 as a science student, before that, I develop passion for electronics and computer programming, so I enrolled in an apprenticeship program which I learnt how to repair electronics devices since my family don't have the financial capacity to support my tertiary education.
I begin to improve my skills in electronics with the help of free online tutorial (most YouTube and Blogs).

I'm a self motivated and passion driven technology enthusiast. I finish whatever I start and I'm a fast learner as well. I love technology and I can say it's my hobby.😊
I wish to study Electrical and Electronics Engineering and I'll be so glad joining this great *Dynamic Student Community.* <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Oluwashina, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

15/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Well Oluwashina now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, the opportunity to relate with people from different backgrounds, cultures, races, with different upbringing, mentality and different view of life.
I believe it will be super amazing staying around these people collaborating, sharing knowledge and life experience and even come up with solutions to unsolved technological problems. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Oluwashina.

Would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, I'm mentally prepared for a life abroad. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - +234 704 103 0083: My parents are now aware, same as my guardian. Yes, my family members are willing to support.
@2348140830225 ?
15/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Oluwashina.

May I know your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?

I believe you must have read in the document too.
15/11/23, 7:32 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, I read the document.
It states that the scholarship covers the Tuition fee and the quantum of the scholarship depends on my performance in the interview with the program director.
So, I and my family are responsible for the rest of the expenses such as feeding.
15/11/23, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: Very well, so what are the finances involved as per you?
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Study materials, accomodations, logistics, feeding....
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, do you recall the figures?
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, the average cost of education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year.
15/11/23, 7:46 pm - +234 704 103 0083: But with Edoofa, this can be minimize to $2000 to $3000
15/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.

So are you parents willing to support you financially with $1500-2000 a year, Oluwashina?
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Not only my parents now, but my family members.😊
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Can you please rephrase, Oluwashina?
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I mean "My parents and my family members are willing to support financially."
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Oluwashina.
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: So why didn't you opt for pursuing your higher education after 2019, Oluwashina?
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Like I said, my parents did not have the financial capacity to support but we have been saving up since then so I can further my education later on, till I came across Edoofa while searching for scholarship opportunities.
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: That's understandable and I thoroughly appreciate their efforts to support you, Oluwashina.

Could you please share your academic results and certificates with me?

16/11/23, 4:25 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Glad to know all this about India.😊
16/11/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Oluwashina.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 4:33 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I am aware, the average cost of education in India without scholarship is $7,000 per year.
16/11/23, 4:36 pm - +234 704 103 0083: And average of $30,000 for international students.
16/11/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Oluwashina
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Let me add, about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.* <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:45 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I really appreciate the effort of *Edoofa* and it's parent company *Anhad Edutrain Solution* on making higher education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words
16/11/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - +234 704 103 0083: This is a great initiative! Making education more affordable and accessible is always a good thing, and Edoofa program seems to be doing a great job.
Additionally, giving students the opportunity to earn while they are learning is valuable, because it can help us to develop our skills and have hands-on experience to become more marketable.
Lastly, I think this program is a great way to help us (students) attain our educational and career goals.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Oluwashina!

I thoroughly appreciate your thoughts and kind words.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 5:08 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I see that Edoofians are having a great experience.
16/11/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Oluwashina
16/11/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 5:10 pm - +234 704 103 0083: That's great. 😀
16/11/23, 5:11 pm - +234 817 230 1447: Good evening I asked him how he got the know about the program
16/11/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
16/11/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Oluwashina
16/11/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, Edoofa is totally unique.
*Persitance is Persistent.* 
I want to be like him. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Oluwashina, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 5:30 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes I am ready.
16/11/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Oluwashina, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 5:34 pm - +234 704 103 0083: $1500 - $2250
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 5:37 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes, Edoofa is making it easy for us
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 5:44 pm - +234 704 103 0083: The flexibility........😀
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 5:47 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Yes I do.
16/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 5:52 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Understood, but I have a question if I may ask!
16/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
16/11/23, 5:58 pm - +234 704 103 0083: If possible, I'm one of the 2024 academic year intake, when I'm I required to pay the Edoofa program fee and when I'm I required to move to India.
16/11/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Your intake would be August 2024, thats when you would be travelling to India!

The program fee is paid after you are found eligible for the program and you receive an acceptance letter, the same happens after your parents appear for a Video call interview with the Program Director.
16/11/23, 6:04 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Thanks for the clarification. While applying for this counseling, I choose 2025 as my preferred academic admission year. I hope this is feasible.
16/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

You can opt for either, becoming a part of the program now would help you earn credits under the Earn While You Learn Program way before coming to India!
16/11/23, 6:08 pm - +234 704 103 0083: I choose *EWYL*
16/11/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Alright, you can go on.
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
16/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

23/11/23, 4:33 pm - +234 704 103 0083: Despite the fact that I'm interested in studying abroad in which Edoofa granted me a great opportunity, I might not be able to make the first payment in before 7 days because presently, my family is facing financial instability.
This is the major reason I chose 2025 as my academic year. I really appreciate Edoofa program and I will be glad if there Stage 2 can be put on hold because I know the payment is required immediately after Stage 2 which is Acceptance into the program.
23/11/23, 6:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Share students current age ?

23/11/23, 6:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: By 2025 education gap won't be justified so students application for education abroad will not approved by embassy so if you have plans for education abroad you have to start education by july 2024 after that there are no chances at all .
23/11/23, 6:57 pm - +234 704 103 0083: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +234 704 103 0083: And if I want to start my education by July 2024, I have to make the payment of the enrollment fee in 7 days right?
23/11/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes
23/11/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The 2024 intake for education abroad is closing soon. The process for studying abroad is distinct, involving the preparation of various documents. Students typically apply 8-10 months in advance, considering that classes commence in July.
23/11/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Unlike local universities, the process for education abroad is not as flexible. It requires meticulous planning and document preparation, and intakes have specific closing dates. It's a structured system that differs significantly from the more flexible admissions process at local universities.
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In Nigeria, local education faces challenges in terms of quality and infrastructure, with a ranking of 129. In contrast, India is positioned at 2, reflecting a significantly higher standard in both education quality and infrastructure.
