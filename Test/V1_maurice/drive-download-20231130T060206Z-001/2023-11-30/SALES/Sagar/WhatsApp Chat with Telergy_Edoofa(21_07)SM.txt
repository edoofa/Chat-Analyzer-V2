28/07/23, 9:46 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/07/23, 9:46 am - Sagar: Your results are currently being evaluated by the Edoofa Academic Board, In the meantime, I would like to share a very important document with you. As you know, you are stepping into a very significant phase of your career where you need to identify the right opportunities as we are well aware there are illegitimate organizations and programs that may misguide you. In order to help you differentiate the same, we have started an *Awareness initiative*. Make sure to go through this document thoroughly.
