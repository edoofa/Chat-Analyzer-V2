You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Entumbane high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 465 9791: Right now I finished my olevel and currently doing bit of parttimes my school usually charged 60 us termly along I wish to study sciences but now working on having maths in June my strengths are in physical education more than mathematical and as much my favorite hobby is reading especially facts
28/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 465 9791: When it comes to my family grew up in a grandparent family due to some circumstances as for my parents my father ended up in zjc level and is currently a gardener as for my siblings most of them they attained o level

28/11/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Well Paidamoyo now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 465 9791: I think it's just a life changing experience but also a way of engaging and understanding different culture that is now we know there is Diwali yet we don't really understand what it is life is not always about life changing but also adapting to different conditions and situations hope u understand what I'm trying to elaborate
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Paidamoyo.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 465 9791: With my enthusiasm I don't think even mentality would be a barrier
28/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
28/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 465 9791: It might be a surprise but greatly indeed they would be happy because they already admire some of my friends abroad
28/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 465 9791: But as far much my father is aware coz he is with us
28/11/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, and what is his financial planning to support your higher education in India financially please?
28/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 465 9791: For now him alone he isn't capable but I guess if I'd get a scholarship he might try by all means to support
28/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 465 9791: His financials now balancing all the needs to attain higher education in India might be a great burden for him but maybe with the help of a scholarship he might be able to access small basic needs
