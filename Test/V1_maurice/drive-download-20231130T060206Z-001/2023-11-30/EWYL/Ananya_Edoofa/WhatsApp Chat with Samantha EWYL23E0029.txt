You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

18/08/23, 7:59 am - +91 76965 68232: Okay. I understand.

18/08/23, 8:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now shall we move forward with the grant discussion?
18/08/23, 8:03 am - +91 76965 68232: Yes, please!
18/08/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
18/08/23, 8:07 am - +91 76965 68232: Yes
18/08/23, 8:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
18/08/23, 8:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
18/08/23, 8:10 am - +91 76965 68232: Ok. I understand
18/08/23, 8:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
18/08/23, 8:15 am - +91 76965 68232: No ma'am
18/08/23, 8:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
18/08/23, 8:16 am - +91 76965 68232: Okay. Thank you.
18/08/23, 8:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
18/08/23, 8:23 am - +91 76965 68232: Alright. I understand.
18/08/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
18/08/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 8:31 am - +91 76965 68232: Okay
18/08/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
19/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Samantha!

I will be available
03/10/23, 8:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:06 pm - +91 76965 68232: Ma'am, you just asked me what is impressing in this video.
03/10/23, 8:07 pm - +91 76965 68232: And l already replied to that.

This was my reply.
03/10/23, 8:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Samantha, did you even watch the video. As per our discussion you on the call you have to share a review on Facebook and Google.
03/10/23, 8:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It is written here as well.
03/10/23, 8:28 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay. I'm sorry l didn't notice that message.

I noticed you've submitted a video for the video editing internship application. It's great that you're eager to showcase your skills. However, for this type of opportunity, it's important to maintain a professional image.

Here are a few suggestions to enhance your video:

Add Subtitles: Subtitles can make your video more accessible and demonstrate attention to detail.

Incorporate Transitions: Smooth transitions between scenes can make your video more engaging.

Include Creative Elements: To stand out, you can add creative elements like animations or special effects to make your video unique and memorable.

Remember, this video is your chance to make a strong impression, so it's worth putting in the extra effort. Good luck with your application!

To begin our session today, I have a really interesting video that will make your life easier and more interesting! You are going to love it! 🚀

https://youtu.be/2HfhqzlqLHY?si=ZGBW5lB4gLN6h5Y9
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 76965 68232: I watched the video Ma'am, l have learnt something new and helpful. 

It is on the Leonardo AI. This is very useful in businesses and brands since they need innovation (in order to make a great impact), hence they can use AI. On that platform, one can create lots of stunning logos. You use the search bar to select the logo you want and download that logo. You can also edit that logo to your own preferences.
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful! You know, *Samantha*, it has been a while since we introduced the $300 plan to you.  However, our entire team has been analyzing the facts and figures and has come to understand that our students are facing numerous challenges. As your mentor, we have collectively decided to provide you with structured training that will not only help you achieve your goals but also save your valuable time. So are you ready for that?
01/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 76965 68232: Yes. I'm ready.
01/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay.
Well noted Ma'am.
01/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've read the first step, could you please share the various types of channels from which you believe potential applications can be found?
01/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 76965 68232: I'm sorry, l am not understanding your question?
01/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have you understood the first step of the document which is about - *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*?
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 76965 68232: Yes, l did. 
But on Step 1 on the types of channels, it is mentioned that it has to be discussed with the mentors.
01/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Samantha we will discuss that now!
01/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay. Now l understand.
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
01/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now I want you to move forward with the second step of our training which is the "Student Admission Eligibility Check"!
01/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information.
01/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
01/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing the Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 3:24 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay.
Well noted.
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
15/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 76965 68232: I don't have any questions.
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.

15/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 76965 68232: Yes
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
15/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
15/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
15/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Students,

Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

24/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
24/11/23, 3:15 pm - +91 76965 68232: Yes
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me brief those again :
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
24/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay.
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 76965 68232: Ma'am, is that the attendance for the webinars I participated in?
24/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 76965 68232: But Ma'am, I still don't understand. 

Does that mean that l did not attend three webinars?
24/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As per our records, you have not attended three webinars out of six.
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.

Before I move ahead, May I know if you have any questions that you would like to ask?
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 76965 68232: I don't have any questions
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 76965 68232: Yes
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Samantha can I see you grant letter?
24/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 76965 68232: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Samantha now as you can see you have received a grant of $300 which will be distributed over a period of 4 years. So you will receive $75 annually toward your tuition fee. However, as you are aware you can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
24/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let me inform you that you have earned $171.20, so you can redeem these in the coming semester.
24/11/23, 4:15 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
24/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Samantha, you are one of those brilliant students who have earned more than their Grant. You have understood the fact that many of our students are not realizing, that while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
24/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
25/11/23, 8:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Samantha!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope that you will now be available.
Cannot wait to see you!🤝🏽
25/11/23, 11:30 am - +91 76965 68232: Okay Ma'am.
Thank you.
25/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 5:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
25/11/23, 5:41 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay.
Well noted.
27/11/23, 9:59 am - +91 76965 68232: Focus and attention create individual ownership of the big picture goals of the whole team. Competition leads to people doing their best being the driver for success.

Individuals and teams who demonstrates a competitive spirit display this by pushing harder than others, demonstrating a higher level of skill, consistently performing at an elevated level, and are the people that others look up to as leaders and role models. In today's life, the spirit of competition can also be a way to improve efficiency and formula of products in companies so as to attract more customers thus achieving higher profits. 

However it can also lead to toxic ego driven mentality which undermines and destroys team objectives and company culture.
27/11/23, 11:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Samantha!🌟🏆

Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
29/11/23, 7:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

29/11/23, 8:17 am - +91 76965 68232: Okay. Well noted.

29/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 76965 68232: It is explaining on the different ways to start a productive day.

Some of the steps include planing your tasks, going to bed on time and having enough rest. Always do tasks in chronological order to develop an organised mindset. Set the goals for your day is a priority. Choosing a nice working environment is also essential to avoid disturbances. Being positive minded also helps to archive the best.
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 76965 68232: I think through social media marketing.
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay. That's great
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 76965 68232: Okay
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
