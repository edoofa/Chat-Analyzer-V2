06/11/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand!
06/11/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 643 4112: I not sure of the two key objectives you can explain to me
06/11/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/11/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l understand  now
06/11/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since today's session is over, let's plan to connect in our next session, which is scheduled for tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.
06/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you for todays session Ms Ananya . I really do appreciate
07/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I am well thank you .
07/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before diving into our today's session, Meet Mr. Anik, our esteemed Career Development Officer, who has carefully curated a selection of the top 5 books that you absolutely shouldn't miss on your personal growth journey

Share the names of the books you have read or want to read soon in the comments!
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Am trying to log in
07/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, you can watch it later.
07/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week.

07/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
07/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Wow thank you. I am so motivated thank you for sharing this news letter with me
07/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
07/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I was so moved when l heard that l am going to die, not that it scared me but it gave me the power to utilize every chance that l have in life

07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am
