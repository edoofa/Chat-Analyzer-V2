28/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 549 8011: Historical novels
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, so have you ever read about the Indian History?
28/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 549 8011: No l haven't
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, if you like reading about history, you should also consider reading about Indian history!
28/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok l will thank you
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 549 8011: They're my parents right now they're at work
28/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 210 6331: Good morning everyone, my name is Eckwell Mlambo. I am Thandoluhle 's  father . I am pleased to be on this program
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 549 8011: No l don't understand
28/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: It is nice to connect with you,@263772106331
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok thank you ma'am l understand
28/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 210 6331: Thank you
28/11/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/11/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, before we sign off, here's a quick one for you: Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything! 😄 Anyway, it was great chatting with you today. 

Let's catch up again tomorrow at the same time, 8:30 AM. Take care and see you soon!
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok thank you ma'am
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 549 8011: Thank you ma'am have a great day
29/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️
29/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 549 8011: Good morning to you too ma'am .... It really is a great country
29/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed,  I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am , yes it sounds interesting
29/11/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/11/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am thank you
29/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 549 8011: I'm done ma'am
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Our session time has come to an end. Let's conclude our discussions here and reconvene tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. for another insightful session. Kindly let me know what exactly did you learn from the newsletter before our next session.

Before we go, as a follow-up to our talk about the *world's highest cricket ground in India*, I've found an amazing picture to share. Take a look!

I look forward to our continued exploration and learning. Until then, have a great day!
