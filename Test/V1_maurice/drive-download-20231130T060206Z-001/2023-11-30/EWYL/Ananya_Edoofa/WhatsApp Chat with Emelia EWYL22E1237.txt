You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay ma'am, noted
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Shall we set a deadline for this task? <This message was edited>

It's wednesday tomorrow, and we are back with our EWYL group session. We will be moving forward with our $300 training session, so do not miss the session!🚀

Time: 6:00 PM
08/11/23, 10:49 am - +91 77175 56230: Noted ma'am
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - +91 77175 56230: Evening ma'am
08/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 77175 56230: Questions which are asked by  international students that I'm supposed to answer...?
08/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 77175 56230: Is that what you meant
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly read the document, Emelia!
08/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Under 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check'
08/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay

1. Why students should choose Edoofa scholarship program and not other agents..?
2. The benefits of choosing to study in India .?
3. Qualifications required to study in India. 
4. The Student's willingness to learn new culture, meet new people and learn a new language
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process by asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
08/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay noted
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay ma'am
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 77175 56230: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:15 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 77175 56230: -Firstly one has to approach eligible students, friends and relatives and offer them the application form 
-Tell them more about the Edoofa scholarship program
-Know about the credits related to the EWYL program when one student successful become a part of Edoofa scholarship program 
-Lastly one has to go to nearby secondary schools informing them about Edoofa scholarship program
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 77175 56230: Thank you 
Noted ma'am
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 77175 56230: Okay noted ma'am
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

The spirit of competition is a dynamic force that propels individuals and groups to strive for excellence, surpass their limits, and achieve their goals.

The spirit of competition is like a fiery forge, where ambition and determination meld into a potent alloy. It’s the heartbeat of progress, urging us to strive, to excel, and to surpass our own limits. 
In this arena, adversaries become allies, pushing each other to greater heights. It’s not just about winning; it’s about growth, resilience, and perseverance. The spirit of competition fuels innovation, propelling us forward even when the odds seem to not be in our favor.

For example during my athletic era. One day when I was on the racing track, as we were about to reach the finishing line after a long marathon .I started losing my breath, I was so tired that I couldn't continue but the thought of other competitors leaving me behind to the finishing line and my team's support, gave me the courage not to give up .Although I  did not take first place finishing the  race was the goal.
28/11/23, 10:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Emelia! 🌟🏆Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
