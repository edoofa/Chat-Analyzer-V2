It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!* <This message was edited>

18/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL group session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. 

To begin with, I believe you must have joined the Career Launch Pad group for your training and internship, haven't you?

18/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 732 3588: Oky I understand what you're saying buy the ghing is right now it is difficult for me but but I assure you that when students finish writing their then we will start to make progress
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's okay, Bryn! So, what do you think are the key points that could be beneficial for students seeking guidance for coming to India for their higher education?
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 732 3588: First indian economy has undergone a great transformation as result of quality of education. India provide an environment for both personal and academic growth.
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Bryn! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 732 3588: Ok noted maam

- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 732 3588: Done
01/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 732 3588: I think social media through share information about Edoofa and how it helped me and connecting through friends and family members to spread the of edoofa throughout the world
01/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, let me share a few more then!
01/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.

01/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 732 3588: Oky
01/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 732 3588: Noted
01/11/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step  *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!

08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
