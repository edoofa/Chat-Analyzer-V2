*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

Yesterday at school I witnessed a procession and there were many people celebrating and throwing flowers. It's really a festive time to be alive and I'm glad I was part of it.
19/08/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, I hope you are doing well.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 92053 63731: Yes it's clear
15/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You can start working on this after the session and make sure you submit the questions by tomorrow.

15/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:

▪️After the introduction, explain the Edoofa Scholarship program.

▪️Describe the application process for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

25/11/23, 1:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
28/11/23, 8:31 am - +91 92053 63731: Part A: Questions.         1. What is the tuition fees that a student pays under Edoofa compared to not being under Edoofa.      2. What percentage scholarship does Edoofa cover for their students.                        3. Please briefly contextualize in your own understand what the EWYL program is.    4. What is the average enrollment fee into a college without scholarship.      5. What is Edoofa's aim for it's students.       Part B: Six points on $300 plan.                     The first point to take into note is the introduction. First impression is important so showing enthusiasm about the Edoofa program towards the students is important as they will feel the need to know more about what you are talking about.                            After the introduction, you delve more into details of the scholarship program. Explain More
28/11/23, 8:31 am - +91 92053 63731: about the councilors and mentors who help every step of your journey before and after coming to India. It is also important to tell them about the financial advantages as it relieves financial stress e.g paying less to study abroad. It is cheaper to use the scholarship program than to go straight to study abroad without it. The next step is to explain about the registration process. Also about the interviews and counseling sessions with councilor and administrators. After that step, highlighting the reasons why to choose Edoofa are needed to make a full proof execution. This is where introducing the EWYL comes into play. Explain more about how the EWYL can further decrease financial stress as a student can cover their whole tuition fees through earning scholarship credits. After that, discussing about why it is considered a dream to study in India. There is a lot of great culture and food to experience. Meeting and interacting with a new group of people is more than exciting and I can really say so myself
