18/09/23, 8:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Leeroy
I hope you are doing well. I am sure that you were told to message first in the group as soon as you have joined, but I can't see any message. May I know if are you facing some challenges?
19/09/23, 5:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa added +263 77 362 7367 and +263 78 358 8882
19/09/23, 8:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 8:30 a.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 8:25 am - +263 77 362 7367: Good morning. Is it not possible to reschedule the session. He will be attending lessons until 4.30. He may not get a chance to attend the sessions.
19/09/23, 8:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, May I know that did you sign the document where you agreed that Leeroy will be available for the sessions?
19/09/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 362 7367: Good morning. Yes I did, I'm only worried about the times. Are they not flexible since he is still a school pupil
19/09/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I would like to tell you that there is a 3:30-hour time difference. So, when it is 4:30 pm in Africa, It is 8:00 pm in India which is quite late for me.
19/09/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Either you can complete these initial sessions on behalf of Leeroy, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) Leeroy can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please make sure that he is regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 362 7367: Ok it can be done but the problem is that right now up to  Friday I am mobile and at times my network is poor. But we can start, I will let you know when I have challenges
19/09/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is Leeroy available on Saturdays?
19/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 362 7367: Yes he is available
19/09/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, then I will take sessions with him on Saturday.
19/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 362 7367: Ok thanks that will be appreciated

10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No need to apologize, I understand. Slow internet connections can be frustrating. Just do your best, and we'll work through it together.
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,

II trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand Leeroy has a lot on his plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to his parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions for Leeroy so that he can concentrate on his upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan, and if you're available for the sessions today?
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 362 7367: Good morning thank you Jasmine. Leeroy is writing his final A'level examinations but whenever he gets a chance he will participate. Im willing to participate in his sessions but it is a time of the year when I travel around a lot on work business and most of the time I will be travelling in the country side where network signal is poor and at times even when there is network I can not use my phone because of the nature of my job. I will try to participate whenever I am available
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 362 7367: Leeroy.vcf (file attached)

It has been a while since we have had a quality conversation.

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Leeroy*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 362 7367: Good morning. Yes  I do recall
18/10/23, 11:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Leeroy* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.

21/10/23, 6:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 802 8306: To help us learn skills that will help us after graduating and help us reduce the our fees while learning and working
21/10/23, 6:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
21/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Yes I now understand
21/10/23, 6:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Yes I understand
21/10/23, 6:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 802 8306: I'm honoured How are you Ms.Sanjana I'm Leeroy Mahuni and thank you for your concern over us students
21/10/23, 6:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
21/10/23, 6:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Ok
21/10/23, 6:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
21/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 802 8306: I understand and also How are you Ms.Davi
21/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Ok understood
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: She is also not online dear
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Oh ok I understand
21/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Ok I will read it now
21/10/23, 6:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
21/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Just finished reading and I really enjoyed reading the newsletter I leant a lot from the letter
21/10/23, 6:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
21/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Thank you I will keep this in mind always
21/10/23, 6:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
21/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Yes I'm always prepared for everything
21/10/23, 6:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 6:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
21/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Yes it's clear I will make sure to submit the answers tomorrow before our session
21/10/23, 6:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if you are available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
21/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Yes I will be available at 5.30 pm during the week is it ok

21/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Noted
21/10/23, 7:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 802 8306: Understood I will always make sure to never forget to remind myself and text how proud I am to be an edoofian

Until then, have a splendid and productive time, dear student!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
