I was unable to add them to the group so I have sent them an invitation. Till the time, I am also sharing the Group Link below. You can share the link with them and they can get themselves added to the group through the link
09/10/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JYrfS0MgvSH16e5QIoWX6k
09/10/23, 8:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know that have you signed the document of being available for the sessions for the next couple of days?
09/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 225 5119: Right now I am at work busy till 6pm .May have the descussion 7pm.Iam sorry for the inconvenience.
09/10/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I understand your work commitments, and I appreciate your willingness to reschedule for 7:00 pm. Regarding the sessions, it's important for us to have consistency in our discussions. Would it be possible for you to attend the session for three consecutive days so that we can complete the introduction of the session and maintain a structured flow of our discussions?
09/10/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like to kindly bring to your attention that there is a significant time difference of 3 hours and 30 minutes between our locations. As an example, when it is 7:00 pm in Africa, it corresponds to 10:30 pm in India. While I am committed to our sessions, I want to mention that this timing is somewhat late for me. 

I believe open communication is key, and I wanted to ensure you are aware of this time difference as we plan our sessions moving forward
09/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 225 5119: OK are you comfortable with 1pm

How are you doing?
09/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 225 5119: We are fine
09/10/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
09/10/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 225 5119: Thank you we welcome u .
09/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
09/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 225 5119: Yes I understand
09/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Lilian is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
09/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 225 5119: That's wonderful we appreciate. These goals.
09/10/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
09/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 225 5119: And vision
09/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 225 5119: Which is a big relieve for the parents I understand.
09/10/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Indeed.
09/10/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
09/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 225 5119: Welcomed
09/10/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 225 5119: Welcome Madam
09/10/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Lilian’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically! <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 995 2536: Amazing   thats good thank you
09/10/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 995 2536: Yes its fine
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lilisn can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
09/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 995 2536: Noted
09/10/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

I trust you all are doing well. I know your child is currently focused on school and exams, and you've formally paused the sessions. However, I want to ensure that Lilian stays connected with the community's progress, and that's why _*I'm willing to share the newsletter from the past week.*_ 📰

16/10/23, 1:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I regret to inform you that you won't be able to continue with the program on Lilian's behalf. This is because, as part of the curriculum, I distribute lessons and activities every Wednesday and Saturday. If Lilian cannot engage with the lessons, I believe it may not be beneficial. What are your thoughts on this?
16/10/23, 1:26 pm - +48 884 767 595: I agree with your opinion ,she will just engage with you when she is done with her final exams
