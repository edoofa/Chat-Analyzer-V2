24/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 000 7228: Yes l am ready mam
24/08/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 000 7228: That is very awesome Ms Jasmine. I am happy that l am able to inspire others to overcome their limits
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 000 7228: Yes mam. It is because of putting a lot of effort and commitment
24/08/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 000 7228: I really appreciate mam and l will continue to aim higher for my future
24/08/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
24/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 000 7228: Thank you Ms Jasmine. I am very excited about this. Currently they are not online but as soon as they come they will comment
24/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 000 7228: So can l print out the grant letter so that we can sign it?
24/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Keith
24/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 000 7228: Okay Ms Jasmine
I will send it back tomorrow morning
24/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
24/08/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 000 7228: Noted with thanks Ms Jasmine

30/10/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Insights and Takeaways from the Webinar*💯

Importance of Internships: Mr. Ian emphasized the significant role internships play in shaping your career and gaining practical experience.

Online Presence: Our character is often reflected through our social media platforms. Mr. Ian highlighted the importance of maintaining a professional and positive online presence.

Following Your Passion: He encouraged the audience to follow their passions, work hard, and be surrounded by people who support and uplift them.

Speaking Your Dreams: Mr. Ian emphasized the power of speaking your dreams into existence and believing in them, which can lead to fruitful results in your career journey.

Skills Development: The discussion also delved into the importance of skill development during internships, helping you become more marketable in your chosen field.

Building a Network: Mr. Ian stressed the value of networking and building professional relationships, which can open doors to career opportunities.

Learning from Experience: Participants learned that real-life experiences, such as internships, provide practical insights and a better understanding of the work environment.

Taking Initiative: Mr. Ian's talk emphasized the importance of taking initiative, being proactive, and seizing opportunities to stand out in your career.
30/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 97799 40390: Good evening Ms Jasmine 😊
30/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes sure mam l will send the answers very soon
30/10/23, 4:39 pm - +91 97799 40390: Certainly! Gaining practical experience through internships can have a significant impact on one's career trajectory. Internships offer an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, allowing individuals to develop practical skills and gain exposure to the professional environment relevant to their field of interest.

Firstly, internships provide a bridge between academic learning and professional practice. By engaging in real tasks and projects, interns have the chance to understand how concepts and theories learned in the classroom are applied in practical situations. This experience enhances their understanding and gives them a more well-rounded perspective of their chosen field.

Secondly, internships allow individuals to build a professional network. During an internship, interns interact with professionals in their respective fields, such as mentors and colleagues. These connections can offer valuable career guidance, mentorship, and even potential job opportunities in the future. Networking is crucial in the professional world, and internships provide a platform to establish connections that can significantly impact a person's career trajectory.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

And finally, we can learn about the significance of light, which represents hope, goodness, and knowledge.

23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $300 annually. 
Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 97799 40390: yes l do remember
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 97799 40390: yes they included total participation in the EWYL group ... a minimum of 75% attendance in class ...maximum cooperation with your mentor
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 


The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 97799 40390: yes its clear to me
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 97799 40390: yes understood
23/11/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Considering a total of 6 sessions with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 97799 40390: okay waiting
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +91 97799 40390: Alright noted
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program - to become job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors & industrial exposure - webinars) plus earning scholarship credits (via working on the projects).
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.
23/11/23, 4:38 pm - +91 97799 40390: Can you please clarify on this mam
24/11/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Keith*,

24/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you visit the doctor Keith?
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 97799 40390: No l haven't
I just took some pills yesterday

24/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 97799 40390: I did tell him
24/11/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nice. I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
24/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes sure mama
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you remember yesterday's conversation.
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes l do
24/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
24/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes l do mam
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Keith. I would like to make it clear that your total Grant Amount is $900 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now is $2.80. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 97799 40390: Okay
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 97799 40390: Okay
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 97799 40390: Alright
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yea done now
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
24/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 97799 40390: The only way to achieve this is to work hard so that l can enroll as many students as possible
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 97799 40390: That is good to hear
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yes sure
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since, we have our call scheduled for tomorrow, I don't want you to miss any call/session from now onwards. 
Will you be abe to that?
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 97799 40390: Yea l will try mam

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth.
