She is currently in school, so I am reaching out on her behalf to express my excitement to begin her EWYL Journey.

03/11/23, 8:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning Makanakaishe and parents*_
My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 03-11-2023 from *8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?

03/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 368 2925: Surely, we can go ahead with the session and excited to have you as our mentor hope we shall work well with you. <This message was edited>

03/11/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First thing first, *_Congratulations_* ✨
On being awarded the Edoofa scholarship, Makanakaishe! This is a fantastic opportunity to expand your horizons, gain new experiences, and make memories that will last a lifetime.
You should feel proud of this achievement, as it is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and determination.
This scholarship is an opportunity for you to grow as an individual, learn about new cultures and ways of life, and achieve your dreams.
All the best!
03/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you, surely we have taken this as a great opportunity to get to know new cultures and way of doing things in an international way.
03/11/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Ideally, our initial orientation involves a comprehensive discussion with students about the mission and vision of the EWYL PROGRAM, followed by a detailed discussion of the various projects. 

However, since you mentioned that Makanakaishe is not available for morning sessions, we will conduct a brief orientation with you. We will provide you with an overview of the program during this short session. We kindly request that you share this information with her or ask her to review the conversation at her earliest convenience. Our full initial orientation process typically spans 2-3 days. May I know if will you be able to attend the session for the next 3 days?
03/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I will inform her. May I know if you hold the sessions over the weekend too? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No, we willl be starting with this schedule from Monday.
03/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I will be available.
03/11/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
03/11/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, thank you very much.
03/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you very much, I'm sure she's ready too to walk this journey with you.
03/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Welcome, I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met.

 Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 368 2925: Two objectives am not sure can guide me there.
I think it has to do with her chosen career that you will be there to guide her. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Makanakaishe is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.

28/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 148 7441: What l got is that before working with a company l should first find out the following

b) Scale of the company - should know their range in terms of number of employees
c) Financial stability - information about their financial status through LinkedIn l can get to know their funding updates
d) background of founder - knowing about the founders work experience and qualifications

*Platforms l can use 
Google, linkedin, inch4media 

Steps l should take 
Step 1 searching about the company
Step 2 study the company
Step 3 study their website
Step 4 checking the various social media pages of the company
Step5 study the background of the founder and the core members
Step 6 reaching out to the marketing manager by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request

29/11/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
29/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 148 7441: Oky so maybe you were going to explain..but wanted to know if the companies we are looking for are based on education..
29/11/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We don't want to restrict you to education-based companies. The goal of this project is for the company to potentially become your future employer, as long as they are willing to offer opportunities to students. Feel free to explore opportunities with any company.
29/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 148 7441: Ohh oky oky l understood
29/11/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
29/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 148 7441: Ohh oky
29/11/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Makanakaishe!
29/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 148 7441: Oky .. ☺️
29/11/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
