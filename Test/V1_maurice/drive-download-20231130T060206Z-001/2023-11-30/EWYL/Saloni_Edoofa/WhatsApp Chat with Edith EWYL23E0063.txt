I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

12/08/23, 12:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

"Every day, think as you wake up: Today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, and I am not going to waste it." - Dalai Lama
Please come on the Dedicated line and follow your ritual to receive your newsletter.
22/08/23, 9:33 am - +91 78273 08969: Good morning! As we gather for our session today, let's remember Gandhi's words: 'The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.' Let's make this session a meaningful journey of learning and growth
Please come on the dedicated line.
22/08/23, 2:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
22/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 455 7715: Yes I am
22/08/23, 3:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
22/08/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 455 7715: Ok I'm following
22/08/23, 4:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
22/08/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 455 7715: Yes I am
22/08/23, 4:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
22/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 455 7715: Thank you ,im following
23/08/23, 8:11 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today? <This message was edited>
23/08/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 455 7715: Good morning maam ,I'm fine how are you and your family
23/08/23, 8:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Every is good, Thank you.
23/08/23, 8:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 455 7715: Well
23/08/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

23/08/23, 9:13 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
In the words of Tony Robbins, 'It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It's what we do consistently.' So, let's embrace the strength of consistency in our journey of learning and growth.

Speaking of consistency, I invite you to join in the proud Edofian ritual on the dedicated Line. Let's come together for our Wednesday lesson.

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your mother are facing. It's natural to feel overwhelmed in such circumstances, You can work hard on the projects and earn scholarship credits to pay the fees. We have students who have paid off their fees completely with scholarship credits.
