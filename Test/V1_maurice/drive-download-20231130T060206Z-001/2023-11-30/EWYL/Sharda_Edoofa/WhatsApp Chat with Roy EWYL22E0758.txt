11/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir.
We are about to start our A level examinations this side and I might not be available online for our sessions for about three weeks.

Thank you so much for notifying about your last examination date.
26/10/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Gerald and parents! @263774923669 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I am not Aware of the festival ma'am and I'd be delighted if you tell me more about it
26/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 492 3669: This looks interesting ma'am
26/10/23, 4:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
26/10/23, 4:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/10/23, 4:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly! Dussehra is a big Indian festival that's all about good defeating evil. It celebrates the victory of a prince named Rama over a demon king called Ravana. Rama rescued his wife Sita with the help of his friends and a special bow. People light up fireworks and have parades to mark this happy day.

But Dussehra is not just about a story; it's also a time for family, fun, and food. People dress up in colorful clothes, visit fairs, and enjoy yummy sweets. They also exchange gifts and greetings. The festival lasts for ten days, and on the final day, giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghnad are burned with fireworks, symbolizing the victory of good over evil in a grand way.

And the best part? Dussehra teaches us some important life lessons. It reminds us that no matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness and truth always win in the end. It encourages us to be brave and stand up against injustice. The festival also promotes unity and togetherness as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate. It's a time to forgive and forget, mending relationships and starting anew.

So, it's like a mix of a thrilling story, delicious treats, and lots of celebrations, all while sharing meaningful messages about courage, unity, and the triumph of good values in life. 🌟🤝🕊️🎆🎁🍬
