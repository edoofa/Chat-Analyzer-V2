How are you?
29/08/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 908 8126: Im good ma'am how are you
29/08/23, 12:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am good dear. Thank you so much for asking.
29/08/23, 12:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
29/08/23, 12:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

Greetings of the day,

I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and sharda.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
29/08/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 908 8126: Ok ma'am
29/08/23, 12:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly do so as soon as possible so that even I can keep a record.

16/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Parent and Nqobitzitha @263789088126 

I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Nqobizitha* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.
26/10/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Nqobizitha and parents @263789088126 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from your end, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

That's fantastic to hear that you enjoy debate! Debating is a great way to sharpen your critical thinking, communication skills, and the ability to articulate your ideas effectively. Do you have any specific debate topics or formats that you find particularly engaging? Whether it's formal debates, impromptu discussions, or specific subjects you're passionate about, I'd love to hear more about your interest in debate.
01/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 908 8126: Well its world school format and any topic is fine
01/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Nqobizitha.

07/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
