03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

I have observed your unavailability in your EWYL Group. You have not responded to even one message which is bothersome.

I hope you understand that I take extra time out of my schedule just to check your performance and share reminders to you so that you do not miss out on any opportunity that other students are receiving by being responsive and available on a regular and timely basis. 

I hope you consider this a priority I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of our interactions in the first place.

25/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Gwitria, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
