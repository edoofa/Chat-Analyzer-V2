Your involvement is crucial to moving forward.

17/08/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 3:16 pm - +91 89686 40316: Good day Ms Aditi .I’m doing just great , hope you are well too.Yes I’m ready for todays session I’m just kinda exhausted I’m coming from school right now but we might as well proceed
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I appreciate your dedication, even though you're feeling tired coming straight from school. It's great to hear that you're ready for today's session.  Let's dive into the session and make the most of our time!
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
17/08/23, 3:28 pm - +91 89686 40316: Sure ma’am I’ll go through the document just now
17/08/23, 3:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That would be great.
17/08/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am waiting for your response.
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - +91 89686 40316: The EWYL program helps me to be ready for my future career by making me aware of the skills that i need in this 21st century as well as acquiring the necessary skills. There are skills that will always be there for example risk taking but there are emerging skills as well such as social media literacy. There are 3 different types of projects with project one being corporate alliances, project 2 is mainly social media related and includes content writing and networking with people online then lastly there is community building where you will be interacting with different schools in your home country. For each task there will be certain credit points that will be awarded.The first project that has to do with corporate alliances helps me to link with companies back home that are technologically driven. I have to create a LinkedIn account which will help me to communicate with different companies as well as the employees and decision makers. This will help me to even get a job later on back home.The main aim is to look for companies that would like to work together with edoofa and they must have something to do with students and their development career wise. There are many things that are put into consideration such as the how stable the business is as well as its size. Thorough research has to be done so as to end up establishing a connection with the companies as well as in relation to the founders.So this is an opportunity to reach out to local schools in my country and to let them know about the edoofa program and I should start with my school. I should let the headmasters or principals know about why i joined the program and the program details as well. After letting them know, I should set up a meeting with the principal and the edoofa program director and i should use the cover letter that you will send to me.
17/08/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is Fantastic, Shammah!
17/08/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
17/08/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's it from my side.
Let's reconvene tomorrow with fresh perspectives and renewed enthusiasm.
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - +91 89686 40316: Thank you ma’am.Enjoy the rest of the night 😊

21/08/23, 3:36 pm - +91 89686 40316: My understanding of the audio is that we should prepare for the future by building a connection right now that is through the creation of social platforms like LinkedIn .You as well shared about corporate alliance which aims to let me understand markets which I’ll enter later in life when I’m still at this younger stage in life
21/08/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic.
21/08/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
21/08/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 3:56 pm - +91 89686 40316: The first project that has to do with corporate alliances helps me to link with companies back home that are technologically driven.

22/08/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great.

22/08/23, 3:56 pm - +91 89686 40316: Understood
22/08/23, 3:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

22/08/23, 4:02 pm - +91 89686 40316: Thank you Ms Aditi
23/08/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
23/08/23, 3:12 pm - +91 89686 40316: Good day Ms Aditi I’m doing quite well , I hope it’s the same your side ..Yes I’m ready for today’s discussion
23/08/23, 3:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
23/08/23, 3:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/08/23, 3:23 pm - +91 89686 40316: Yes Ms Aditi that’ll be excellent
23/08/23, 3:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/08/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
23/08/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/08/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
23/08/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/08/23, 3:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
24/08/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

20/10/23, 2:38 pm - +91 89686 40316: Ok
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

07/11/23, 2:15 pm - +91 89686 40316: Let me think of one , Not any questions close by.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - +91 89686 40316: All is clear ma’am
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
07/11/23, 2:20 pm - +91 89686 40316: I am really excited to hear this ma’am. Such a wonderful opportunity I can say ma’am
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - +91 89686 40316: Very well ma’am , Only SEO had me stuck , what’s that
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Shammah SEO is Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
07/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 89686 40316: Understood ma’am
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
07/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 89686 40316: That’s right ma’am , I am sure I can play along with everything required
07/11/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
15/11/23, 4:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥
