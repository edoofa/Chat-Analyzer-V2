11/10/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Noted,
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Abdul, I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: No it's not like that, we are have netwrok challenges, its not stable
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Strugling to download this video due to network
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Abdul is currently at school, am his parent who you interacting with,
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you for letting me know.
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand.
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you as you have joined our group for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 430 1947: My Name is Petros Rachiti, Abdul-Saeed's father,
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Nice to meet you sir!
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 430 1947: Thank you
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!

12/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with our discussions.
12/10/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Abdul* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
12/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Oky maam

12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Abdul*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Abdul* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Noted
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Abdul* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
12/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Oky

No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
12/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely having this session with you, and I am looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Ms Aditi my I ask a question
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 039 4189: May*

After that, you were contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you to fund your higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build your personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
13/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Noted

27/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 039 4189: I understand that ..in terms of awareness.we should be well informed and have knowledge of current technology  and be updated .. 
Also due to the COVID 19 pandemic where many people lost their job and people where unabke to go to work so due to current technology the businesses come up with I deals of commencing their meetings online through platforms like zoom etc ... .... Also I found out that there a 3 project mentioned there .. 

Project one say that I should make a list of major business that are Fintech and offer service to students. And have to know and approach their decision makers and know their LinkedIn. Also I ahve to know the number of employees that are there ..and their net revenue should be around $1,2 million. 
Activity 2 is to make a sheet in excel of the above companies and have to get their id number email addresses and LinkedIn. Have to arrange the call with them and the Edoofa .. 

Project 2 is about  Community building where student will reach out to the surrounding location and community with the intention to spread out about Edoofa .

 Project 3 
This project is about African school education reform mission 
Under this ..the student will approach different school including his school with the help of outer who have graduated they secondary education. Upon approaching these schools they will help to create a bond between Edoofa and the school principals or headmasters . Any student who will be interested in this program and apply the owner of the project will get scholarships credits .

Under all these projects if the targets are reached and became successful there is a reward is scholarship credits which will held to reduce the burden of covering other expenses..
27/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 039 4189: That's my understanding Ms Aditi
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

28/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 039 4189: May I ask
28/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 039 4189: After I give this to a student a fill it ..do I have to send it to you
28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Abdul!
You have to share the filled out form on this group only.
28/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Oky Ms Aditi thank you
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ABDUL/ADITI*
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Noted Mrs Aditi
28/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Is it possible to do it with form 5 but are going to form 6 next year

28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, if they would be coming to India in the Year 2025.

28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 039 4189: Yes
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/11/23, 6:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

29/11/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
