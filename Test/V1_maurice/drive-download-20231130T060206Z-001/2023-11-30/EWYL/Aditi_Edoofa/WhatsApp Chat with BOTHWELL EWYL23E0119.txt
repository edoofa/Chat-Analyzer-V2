Hope you are well.
14/09/23, 7:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
14/09/23, 7:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.
16/09/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Bothwell!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 650 4403: On Saturday
20/09/23, 8:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
20/09/23, 8:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted, be there on time for your session.
30/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: Bothwell, I need to express my disappointment that you weren't present during the session. I adjusted my schedule to accommodate you, and I had higher expectations from you.
30/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Sorry for that one l had a lesson to attend
03/10/23, 7:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

Okay, I understand but you should have informed me as these sessions were scheduled especially according to your convenience.
07/10/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello BOTHWELL!
I trust you're doing well.

I'm currently in a crucial meeting and need to reschedule our session for 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM.
Thank you for understanding and reflect on the insights gained till now may I know why you haven't acknowledged my last message yet, are you facing any challenges? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 11:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Bothwell and Parents @263772677020 @263776504403 

I hope this message finds you well. As *Bothwell's's exams are presumably completed*, I would like to discuss when he plans to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* His progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know his availability.
