I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Evening.Congradulations to the new edoofians
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes l am available
19/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
19/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 456 2494: The steps are very clear.
19/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes l am following
19/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 456 2494: I understand
19/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes clear and understood
19/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

19/09/23, 10:58 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Thank you same to you

21/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
21/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
21/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes we are on the same page
21/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
21/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 7:30 PM. <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

25/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 356 9702: 2)Cavitation means the formation of air bubbles in fluid in low pressure condition which is lower than the saturation pressure.It is a potentially damaging condition in which the fluid in pipes or  drains is at higher velocities.The Bernoulli equation suggest that at high flow velocities the pressure head of fluid is reduced accordingly since the fluid is less than saturation pressure dissolved gases are released from the fluid and these air bubbles will suddenly collapse when the flow enters into a region of higher pressure.This produces a high dynamic pressure which causes damage to the pipelines due to its high pressure.Generally the reasons for cavitation are decrease in pressure below the vapor pressures , other factors such as fluid contamination and dissolved gas in the which is mostly cavitation occurs where pressure is lowest for an example at the end of the pipes and narrow pipe sections.
25/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes sir. lam sending them.l had planned them somewhere
25/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 356 9702: 3)Soil renforcement is a mechanical means of stabilizing weak soils that involves the use of fibrous materials geotextiles and metal strips.It is a method adopted to improve the strength and stiffness of the soil layers . Different ground improvement techniques are used to enhance the soil strength like vibro replacement stone and sand columns by providing root piles soil nailing ,strips and membranes , stone columns and granular blankets.After the improvement soil can manage to with stand large tensile strength.The above .The soil determine the renforcement required.The vibro replacement stone and sand columns are widely used soil renforcement methods globally.It is commonly used to densify loose granular soils by holes jetted into soft , fine grained soil and backfield with densely compacted gravel or sand .Over the past few years , the technique has been used to reinforce soft and alluvial deposits.Vibro replacement stone and sand columns offer considerable time savings over other ground improvement methods like preloading and vertically drains .It also cost effective.Its disadvantage is that it is limited bearing capacity.
There is soil nailing reinforcement method of reinforcing the soil with steel bars or other materials.It is an alternative to another conventional supporting system as it offers flexibility,rapid construction and competitive cost . There is also reinforcement using stone column and granular blanket.
25/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 356 9702: 4)Mivan is a method by which a structure to the building and the hold the concrete until they gain 50 % of the required strength .This innovative form of work is usually used for constructing houses at a faster speed .The speed of construction is for large projects such as township projects .Mivan method is considered economical.Mivan frame works are mostly split into four parts which are 
1)
a .wall panel
b .Rocker
c .kickers 
d.Stub bin

2)Beam components 
a .beam slide panel
b.prop head 
c.soffit beam

3)Deck components
a.Deck Panels
b. Deck prop
c. Soffit length

4)Other components 
Mivan method is mostly used because of its advantages.It requires relatively less labor.There is also faster completion of floors.There are lesser number of joints and reduced leackages.The walls are finished smooth.It requires low maintenance.There is good quality construction of work and no need of plastering.

Mivan technology is mostly preferred for construction of a large number of houses at a short period of time without any trouble.It permits shuttering for both slabs and columns in construction.The walls are extremely sturgy and strong forms and are constructed with the utmost accuracy plus it is easy to manage.The main features in construction are load carrying capacity,striking time , durability and cycle time.
25/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 356 9702: 5)Prefabricated structures are manufactured off site usually in a factory, and then transported to the construction site for assembly.They are sometimes called modular structures.Prefabrication is becoming more popular these days as it can be more cost effective than traditional construction methods.There different types of prefabricated structures which are called panelized systems , where the walls and floors of a building are pre built in a factory and then transported to the site and assembled like a puzzle. The prefabricated construction can be more cost effective than traditional construction. Since the structures are built in a factory there is less waste and less chance for human errors . Prefabricated structures can also be done faster since work is done simultaneously in a factory rather than subsequently on site.Since also the work done is in a controlled environment.The quality of the finished product is more consistent. Pre engineered buildings are often used for industrial or commercial projects such as warehouses , factories and retail stores .In addition to being strong and durable , pre engineered buildings can be erected quickly and at lower cost than traditional construction methods.
25/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Please help me if there is need for corrections

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 456 2494: A good evening to you .
03/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes we can proceed
03/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
03/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes the information is very accurate

04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 7:30 am - +263 78 356 9702: Very sorry.l had network problems yesterday
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Evening.We are doing fine
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Hope it's the same at your side
05/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes .We can proceed
05/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Definitely l will need to choose.If the offers reach that point.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Following
05/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 356 9702: L had not captured the enrollment fee.

Since it is part of the school fees ,l believe it is workable
09/10/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
10/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Evening our network problem has been resolved
10/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No problem at all. I'm glad to hear that your network issue has been resolved. Whenever you're ready and comfortable to continue our discussion, please feel free to let me know.
10/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 356 9702: We can continue sir
10/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes .We are on the same page
10/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
10/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
10/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Well explained and understood
10/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
10/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
10/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Very clear
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 356 9702: L have no queries .The process looks manageable
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

11/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
11/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 356 9702: L have reviewed them and they are very helpful indeed
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes we can proceed and discuss
11/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 356 9702: That's really amazing.
11/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Edoofa students have the previlege .
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes sir we are on the same page
11/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
11/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Yes sir
11/10/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 356 9702: Thank you  very much. Have a great day .
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Tavonga

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Tavonga EWYL23E0635*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BW5EGh7mhJoJJp8jSOKl9P"
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Tavonga J Mudhe and my EWYL group name is Tavonga EWYL23E0635.* I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
12/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 356 9702: L am joining.My parents are not around l will tell the to join once they are around
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session of your admission process?
13/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was hoping for a response from your end regarding our conversation about the admission process so that we can complete our discussion in due time. However, I did not receive a response from your end. Please let me know if you have received my message so that we can proceed and complete our session for the admission process.
16/10/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
16/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good evening. Very sorry l think he did not notice it. We are not near him, We will call he. He is busy preparing for exams start on Tuesday 17 October . Very sorry
16/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's clear that Tavonga may face some difficulties in attending our session due to examactivities. I kindly request both you and Tavonga to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
16/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Well noted
16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Let's proceed
16/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 pm. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok noted
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good evening sorry l had challenge of electricity and network because of heavy rains we received.  We can start if you are available.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I'm here and ready to proceed with the session.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Noted
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Answer number 1
17/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes it's clear
17/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 456 2494: This one is also good. But l think it's good to have good A level pass
17/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok.
17/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes what are the costs
17/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The exact course will be provided to you once you have received our offer letter from the universities. May I know if you are clear here?
17/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok it's clear
17/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Tavonga's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Tavonga is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Sure yes if it is 100% because get US dollars is a  problem and will be very difficult in few months to get it.
17/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Tavonga's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok thank very much.
15/11/23, 6:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tavonga.

4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Noted
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall wait for your reply.
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. This delay might have led to missing out on this opportunity. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good afternoon very sorry for the delay in responsing. I also hope you are well.  Q1 total tuition per semester is $2000 and l pay half $1000  . Q2 duration 4yrs. Q3 $300 and $100. Q4 $750.
16/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, May I know if semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter is correct?
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Semester tuition if is  $2000 and the scholarship will pay half
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000* 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes l will pay $1000 by *two  semesters come to $ 2000 per year
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Sorry can l come back to you around 6:30 l am not a bit busy.
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely let me know when you are ready to proceed.
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Thank you. Tomorrow 12:30 it's ok
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. I would like to let you know that I am now ready and active to take on your session for the admission process.

I would like you to give your full participation and concentration during these few hours that are required to complete and conclude our session for the day without any delay that may lead to the rescheduling of the session and the delay of this letter. So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good afternoon. I am ready
17/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Understood
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Its clear. Sorry for delaying network problem
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes understood
17/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes you can explain
17/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok understood
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes Sir
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 456 2494: I understand. I'm residing in Bulawayo.
17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Thank you so much
17/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok thank you
17/11/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 456 2494: No have them. Thank very much
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Right Name, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
17/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok understood
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Understood
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes understood
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 456 2494: I do not have. Thank very much it's clear.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

27/11/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tavonga. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I would like to inquire about the first part of your registration fee statement. You mentioned that it would be paid on the 27th of November. Hence, may I know if you were able to make the payment of the fees?
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Good afternoon. Very sorry not yet. Let me see tomorrow if we can get something
27/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, May I know if you are facing any challenges?
27/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Yes sir I am no longer working and my wife is getting Zimbabwe Dollar.  So things are not balancing
27/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand your situation and appreciate your honesty in sharing your current challenges. Financial situations can indeed be tough to navigate, especially with changes in employment and currency constraints. And as your admission officer I am here to help you out. 

Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of 28th November. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
27/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok
27/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, May I know the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of 28th November.
28/11/23, 6:08 am - +263 77 456 2494: Morning. To be honest we are waiting for someone who promised to give. Is it possible to defer to next intake.
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parets and Tavonga!

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your honesty and for keeping me informed about the situation. I understand that waiting for external support can be uncertain and challenging. May I know what exactly happened to that trusted person?
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Sorry for late reply. Things are not going well my dear. I am not working these days so the other salary is not enough for the daily family needs. Maybe in 3 to 4 months l will be up.
28/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing it with me. It is understandable that these difficulties may arise and can impact plans and create uncertainty. Given the circumstances I am your admission officer and I am here to help you out on this to help secure Tavonga's offer letter. Hence I shall be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and in that I shall be addressing this concern. With that I woul like to know how much were you able to gather that can be paid before the end of this month that is 30th of November. The reason I am saying this is that after this month the university will be closing the round of application and I am afraid I will not be able to help you out after this date. So could you please provide me with the amount gathered by now?
28/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Thank very much can you permit to update you tomorrow morning before 08:30 for a better position
28/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and indeed, you are permitted. However, please do provide me with the details before 12:30 PM, as after that, our meeting shall commence.
28/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 456 2494: Ok thank you.
28/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
29/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 456 2494: A good morning. For this month, as it is l will be lying, we do not have.
29/11/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Tavonga!

Thank you for sharing the update with me. In that case may I know if there is any back up plans that you have made for Tavonga's higher education?
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 456 2494: At the moment we do not have. We just hope maybe  by around April I will have any income project. Then I will see his way forward. But at the moment I am in dark moments.
