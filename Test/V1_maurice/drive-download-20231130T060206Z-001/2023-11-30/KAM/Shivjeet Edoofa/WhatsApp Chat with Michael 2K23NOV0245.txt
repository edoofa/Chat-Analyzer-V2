This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

21/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 871 1608: 2)The diference between rights and duties are that Rights are things that a person is entitled to, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Duties, on the other hand, are things that a person is obligated to do, such as paying taxes or obeying the law. While rights and duties are different, they are often related. For example, one person's right to life may come with the duty of others to not harm them. 
On another note Human rights and civil rights are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between them. Human rights are universal rights that belong to every person, regardless of their nationality or where they live. Civil rights are specific legal rights that belong to citizens of a particular country. For example, the right to vote is a civil right, while the right to life is a human right.
21/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 871 1608: 3)A prosecutor is a type of attorney, but not all attorneys are prosecutors. A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their job is to bring charges against the accused and try to prove their guilt. An attorney, on the other hand, can represent either the government or the accused. They can also represent clients in civil cases, such as divorce or personal injury cases. So all prosecutors are attorneys, but not all attorneys are prosecutors.

21/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 871 1608: (5)I think I can be a better lawyer because

6)The ability to stay organized and manage time effectively now l do all my things in time 
7) I have the ability to work well with others as l did effectively at school 
I’m sure with these skills l have l will be a better lawyer , the only thing stoping me is the sound education about law I will get with your help and l will be good to go
21/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Michael!

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said, I will be reaching out to you tomorrow to further proceed with the session. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let me know. I am always happy to guide you through them. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Good evening,we are pleased to have you  ,have a great night too
22/11/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Michael!

I hope you are having a wonderful time. I would like to let you know that I will be available for this evening at 6:00 PM CAT. So please stay tuned and relax for now, and let us connect at the said time frame. Please enjoy your afternoon!
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will help you chose the best out of them based on your preferece.   Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Yea that’s correct
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cThat's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Following
22/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
22/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
22/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Yes I have
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $175 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Understood
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Am excited 😊
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 871 1608: As of now l don’t have any
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Okay have a good night
23/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 871 1608: Good evening yes I’m ready
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.
