Please let me know if you are availabel and ready so that we could proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Available & ready now

19/09/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 228 5306: We are ready Sir. Kindly proceed.
19/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 228 5306: We can proceed. Well understood there
19/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
19/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Very clear
19/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Following…..
19/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 317 1188: All clear
19/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well explained. All clear
19/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

12/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
13/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Video showed Edoofians Hall of Fame, giving pictures of Edoofa Scholarship Beneficiaries from yesteryears. The video also highlighted challenges faced by African Students, despite their high potential, which is the gap that the Edoofa Program looks to plug off.
13/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 228 5306: The video sums up Edoofa’s vision & it’s expectations on the beneficiaries.
13/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 228 5306: I am
Available
13/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
13/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
13/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
13/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
13/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 228 5306: We are very much on the same page, thank you
13/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
13/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 11:00 AM.
13/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/10/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.

20/10/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I will be available till 1:00 PM as I have a meeting with the admission team. So, may I kindly ask if you might be available and ready for now to proceed with the session or schedule our session this evening at 7:30 PM?
20/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 228 5306: 7:30pm is accommodative for me
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Lindsey.

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?
21/10/23, 8:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 228 5306: Available Sir. We can proceed
21/10/23, 9:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 9:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 9:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 228 5306: Kundly enlighten us in how the fees structure of current year can be aligned with that of the following year. I am
Missing that part Sir. Thank you
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
21/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 228 5306: Please proceed
21/10/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
21/10/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
21/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 228 5306: Very clear. Well explained
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
21/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well explained. This is very clear. Thank you
21/10/23, 12:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 228 5306: On this one, I want to understand on which one happens first, getting the Admission Letter or Paying the Registration Fees. Kindly clarify
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your query. In the Edoofa scholarship process, the registration fee is typically paid first. This fee is essential to secure your scholarship seat at the university and is adjusted to your first-year expenses. Once the registration fee is paid, you will receive your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is a crucial document for confirming your admission and obtaining your student visa.
21/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well noted Sir. Thank you
23/10/23, 6:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time
23/10/23, 6:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 6:40 am - +263 77 228 5306: 1500hrs is still good Sir. Thank you
23/10/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Lindsey!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Also available now
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood. I am following
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

14/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Lindsey.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 228 5306: This is very good news.  We look forward to your contacting us at 12pm. Thank you very much
15/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lindsey,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Ready to discuss now Sir
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Perfect approach. We can proceed
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 228 5306: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter? *$900.00*
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course? *5yrs*
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)? *$300*
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well? *$750*
15/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 228 5306: See above highlighted responses on the questions above.
15/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well clarified
15/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Is the fees payable per semester or it has to be paid as a once off annual fee?
15/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the payment, the fees are typically payable on a per-semester basis. This means you'll be paying the tuition fee for each semester before the start of that semester. The annual fee is essentially the sum of the fees for both semesters in a given academic year.

So, to clarify, you'll pay your tuition fees twice a year, at the beginning of each semester. This approach helps in managing the financial aspects of your education more conveniently. Please let me know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood and greatly appreciated.
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Is this payable per semester as well or it has to be paid 100% upfront for the whole year
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 228 5306: And for students who will be unable to come back home to Zimbabwe during holidays, will university accomodation continue being available for them? If so, is there an extra cost to it?
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I shall answer them accordingly tomorrow. Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Blessed night to you too. God bless you
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Ready to roll Sir. We can proceed with discussion. 

How are you today?
16/11/23, 1:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We're all doing well, thank you. We're ready to dive into today's session. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 228 5306: It is quite clear.
16/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 228 5306: I just want to know if students will be allowed in hostels during vaccations in case they don’t travel back to Zim for their holidays
16/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The accommodations in the hostels will be open throughout the whole year, allowing students to either go home or use that time for vacation, travel, and exploring great places in India.
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Wonderful piece of news. Thank you
16/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Is it $100/module per term or it’s $100/ exam session?
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is $100 per exam season which you can refer to as per semester. I hope you are clear on this?
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Very clear now. Thank you
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Following
16/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 228 5306: I can see the payment is being made to a different organisation, not Edoofa and not the University. Kindly enlighten us on that
16/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The payment is not being made on a different organisation they are indeed an Associate working for Edoofa whom they will help you guide you through the payment transfer to our bank. I will get you about this very shortly. So shall we move on with the session?
16/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Let us proceed
16/11/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Kindly enlighten us on this
16/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Apologies, was stuck in traffic. It was rudh hour here in Zim
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. I would like to let you know that I am now ready and active to take on your session for the admission process.

I would like you to give your full participation and concentration during these few hours that are required to complete and conclude our session for the day without any delay that may lead to the rescheduling of the session and the delay of this letter. So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.
17/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Ready now Sir. We can pick up our discussion
17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
18/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 228 5306: This plan is workable with us.  Thank you
18/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 228 5306: We had some commitments yesterday that ran deep into the night hence our failure to communicate. My sincere apologies Sir.
18/11/23, 9:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright,  Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 9:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 228 5306: We do not stay in Hre Sir. We are based in Gweru
18/11/23, 9:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 9:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 9:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
18/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Received wth thanks
18/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well noted Sir. Thank you
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 228 5306: So to be paid urgently is $300? Then balance of $300 by 28 Dec 2023?
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Confirm
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
22/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood
22/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
22/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
22/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
23/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Lindsey !

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter.
23/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
25/11/23, 8:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together.
27/11/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Lindsey!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me if your are currently online so that we can proceed with the sesison?
27/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well noted Sir.
27/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Now ready Sir, we can proceed
27/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
27/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
27/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
27/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood. I just want to know what sort of jobs will the student be undertaking under the EWYL Program
27/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to see your interest in understanding the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program's details. The EWYL Program offers various employment opportunities that allow students to earn scholarship credits while contributing to their education.

Typically, the jobs available through the EWYL Program are tailored to suit students' capabilities and schedules. They often include roles like tutoring, content creation, research assistance, administrative support, and even participation in certain campus initiatives or projects. You can connect with your mentors for more details. May I know if we are on the same page here?
27/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 228 5306: We are now very much aligned. Thank you
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 228 5306: Well understood there. Thank you
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
27/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 228 5306: It is all clear from this end, thank you

I hope you are doing well and blessed. As today marks the deadline of the payment of your registration fees. Could you please let me know if there is any update regarding the payment for your first part of your university registration fees?
29/11/23, 11:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good morning dear parents and Lindsey. 

I hope you are having a fine morning today. I was reaching out yesterday for an update regarding the payment of your first part of your university registration fee. However my message was left unseen and unattended. In addition the payment receipt was not shared with me.

Henceforth I would like to give you a good news that your university has extended the deadline untill the end of this month which is tomorrow and after that they will be closing the round of application for this month. If you happen to miss this I am afraid I won't be help you out on this. Hence may I know how much were you able to gather as of now to meet the payment deadline for tomorrow? <This message was edited>
