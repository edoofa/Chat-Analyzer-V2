Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
19/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Good evening, we got the message sorry for the late reply.
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, how are you doing today?
19/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Not bad doing fine
19/10/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. If you are available shall we proceed with the session.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected @263773610209
19/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes but my internet is poor
19/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the session.
20/10/23, 7:44 am - +263 77 361 0209: Good morning
20/10/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your messages by the time you have shared, as it was past my available hours. I am happy to let you know that I will be available till 1:00 PM as I have a meeting with the admission team. So, may I kindly ask if you might be available and ready for now to proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Tanaka.

I hope you are well and blessed. I was waiting for a response from you, hoping to continue our conversation regarding the admission process. However, I was not able to receive a response from your end concerning the same. I would like to let you know that I am now active and ready to take on our session. If you are available, please do let me know so that we can wrap up our session early.
20/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Good evening was a little busy in the morning till late afternoon. We can proceed.
20/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your response. I understand that you had a busy day. Let's proceed with our session now. With that said may I know if you were able to go through my above message?
20/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes indeed we can go ahead.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you may remember, we've already wrapped up the initial three phases of your admission process, encompassing the Message from the founders (consisting of the 4 videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration procedure we went over).

Now, shifting our focus to the fourth step, the offer letter, it's imperative for us to guarantee a thorough comprehension of the registration process. So, if it's convenient for you, could you kindly provide a brief summary of your understanding?
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 361 0209: After when I receive University Offer letter l will pay $750 registration fee so as to reserve my seat.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes we are on the same page
20/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 361 0209: But from my side it's a request that if possible you can choose a university which is not expensive please.
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, you can. You will be receiving multiple offer letters, and from that, you will be able to decide on a cheaper one. May I know if you're clear here?
20/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes i got it thank you.
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
20/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes iam ready
20/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 361 0209: I am done with the benefits we can go ahead.
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Thank you very much for the good information.
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes well explained.
20/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes yes i do understand the concepts.
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 361 0209: As of i think i dont have any question may in future as we proceed. Thank you.
20/10/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 361 0209: The scholarship quantum are statement of entry, o level results and identity card.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Tanaka !

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to receive a reply from you regarding the admission process for Tanaka , and it seems that my previous message was left unattended.
25/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, as your admission officer, I am committed to ensuring you have a better future and affordable. So please let me know if you are available so that I can share the details of these benefits with you to help alleviate your financial burden. And it is for a limited time, I don't want you to lose out on this opportunity as well.
25/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that being said, I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currenly available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Good afternoon, yes will be available at 7:30 pm
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: very well we shall connect at the said time frame.
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Good evening we are doing fine.
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear you're fine. Shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes we can proceed
25/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust you've had a wonderful day so far. I apologize for not being available earlier as it was beyond my designated hours. However, I am now fully prepared to kickstart our session. It's important to note that I'll also be at your disposal in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's seize this opportunity and make the most out of our session.
26/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Lets kickstart our session.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes
26/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
02/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Good afternoon, yes we are ready.
02/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
02/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes i understand that after when I receive the University Offer I will pay the enrollment fee of $750.
02/11/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 361 0209: You can elaborate on costs of higher education.
02/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
02/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes you can go ahead
02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
02/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes sir
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes sir you can proceed
02/11/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
02/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 361 0209: No I don't have any questions to ask.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
02/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Yes sir I am looking forward.
02/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
02/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Noted sir, I will be waiting for your response.
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
02/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 361 0209: Noted sir, have a great day ahead.
