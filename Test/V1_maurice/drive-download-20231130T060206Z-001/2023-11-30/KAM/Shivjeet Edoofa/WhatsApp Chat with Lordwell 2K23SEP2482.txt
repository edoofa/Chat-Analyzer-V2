03/10/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your perspective on the Earn While You Learn Program. It indeed is a remarkable aspect of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, as it recognizes the financial challenges that many students and their families face. By providing an opportunity to earn while pursuing education, it not only eases the financial burden but also instills a sense of responsibility and work ethic in students.
03/10/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

04/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which are scheduled to begin on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.

However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled, that parents can actively participate in. <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. hence, if you are occupied with school, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program
04/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Thank you sir ,it is highly noted

05/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
05/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 621 5516: okkay thank you sir , we can start our discussion
05/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir you may go ahead and explain the cycle in detail
05/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir these two steps are clear
05/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 621 5516: indeed sir l am following
you may proceed
05/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir they are totally clear steps👏
05/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we can start
05/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir you can send the videos

05/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 238 3956: Thank you sir good night
05/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Good night.
06/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 621 5516: As the founders were sharing,those students who have managed so far to attain Edoofa scholarships the have been going through life transforming education and they are becoming more confident. There photos which were shared are testimonies of Edoofa scholarship credits. Edoofa has helped students across Africa to clear all the problems they are facing in learning. On the first step students should be teachable and should be open minded .They should consistently follow instructions .

From the second video ,It is a smooth process to get an Edoofa scholarship .They gave an example that it only takes 30 days to come from Ghana to lndia when one follows instructions, the process is smooth and affordable. Edoofa has friendly relationship with schools, colleges and universities across lndia .With Edoofa you will increase your capacity for success.

From third video they highlighted why they are sharing these videos ,they said so that one is able to interact with people at the universities. That said Edoofa has a record of students who managed to make it in life.Founders encouraged students to keep on following instructions so as to prepare themselves and qualify for these prestigious institutions.They will call multiple universities so that they will interact with me as a student.

After that the statement of purpose is offered .Every student qualifies themselves into the program and should explain why they are suitable. As a student l should be able to to explain why l chose a particular program and particular university .The admission board will give us a form and we will fill it.There should be no delays .Student should fill the statement of purpose in time.
06/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 621 5516: That was my understanding from the videos👏
06/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Evening sir ,how are you today
06/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Lordwell. 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect at our scheduled time. May I know if you are currently available to further proceed with the session?
06/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 621 5516: l am doing well sir 

no problem sir ,we may proceed with our session
06/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir we are on the same page!
06/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 621 5516: we can proceed
06/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 12:00 PM.
06/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

How are you doing today?
07/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 621 5516: *Q2 Cavitation refers to the transformation of air bubbles in fluid in low pressure condition which is lower than saturation pressure .It is potentially damaging condition in which the fluid in pipes or sewers is at high velocities.It occurs when the liquid in a pipe turns to a vapour at low pressure .When cavitation occurs ,air bubbles are formed when this low pressure reduces to the vapour pressure of liquid .As the liquid passes from low pressure to high pressure region the air bubbles explode.Common causes of cavitation include clogged filters ,pipe blockage on the suction side and poor piping methods.effects of cavitation can be heard as loud noise and vibtlration .The vapour bubbles in the water implode causing the noise .This is followed by a heavy impact .Cavitation causes pitting of the impeller and pump housing.

*Q3 Soil reinforcement is a mechanical means of stabilizing weak soils that involves the use of fibrous materials as geosythesis naturals synthetic randomly distributed fibres. It is a way of increasing strength and stiffness of soil .ln old ways it was used to reduce soil erosions at marshy lands and river boundary sand .Types of soil reinforcement include commonly strips are used eg metals as galvanized steel ,aluminium magnesium alloy ,chrome stainless steel .Some other types of strips are bamboo stripps ,polymer strips and glass fibre strips .Benefits of soil reinforcement are:It uses layers of geogrid to reinforce soil,increasing bearing capacity and increasing resistance to differential settlements in short it prevents buildings from collapsing .Reinforcement bearing pressures ,which can eliminate the need for expensive foundations .Weak foundations may lead to building collapse and also poor architectural methods

*Q4 MIVAN is a quality aluminium structure developed by a European construction company known as Mivan company ltd.Its key uses include :Easy to operate within less time, It includes 3s scheme of construction to give strength ,safety and speed ,slabs and walls are easily formed in one consistent development ,assembly and fitting the part of shuttering and Beam construction and column are removed.

09/10/23, 8:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Lordwell.

09/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 621 5516: thank you sir 👏
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 621 5516: can u please allow me to send my statement of entry later sir
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely. May I know by when you might be able to share it with me?
09/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 621 5516: First thing tomorrow in the morning sir 👏
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that, in the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we can proceed
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir this information is very accurate ...
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 621 5516: we can proceed
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir l am ready 
you may begin
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir indeed that's not possible
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we discussed about it
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we are on the same page 
we may proceed
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir l have taken note of this fee breakup
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 621 5516: well noted sir .....l am following
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 621 5516: no queries so far 
We can proceed sir
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we will be happy as a family
09/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: woww that's so nice .....woww
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir we may proceed with the discussion
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 621 5516: well understood sir 
l am following
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 621 5516: indeed sir
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Okkay sir l am following
10/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 621 5516: so far l have followed the details sir 
not yet sir
10/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 621 5516: No sir ,you may provide me with more information on it
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir now it's more clearer now
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir l agree
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir l am clear about this
10/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 621 5516: we may proceed
10/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 621 5516: this is clear !,we may continue
10/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 621 5516: okkay sir 
so this is the refunding method?
10/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that's correct. If you decide to discontinue your education and not pursue further studies or a diploma course, the Edoofa program provides a refunding method through the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. This refunding method ensures that you receive an earning in cash equal to the registration fee and enrollment fee you have paid, along with certificates for completing various job-oriented projects during your one-year participation in the program. The earnings will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 621 5516: well understood sir
10/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 621 5516: No sir ,l don't have any queries with both
10/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 621 5516: indeed sir l am looking forward to that
10/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 621 5516: you are welcome sir
Yes sir we may proceed ,thank you
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell.

14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 238 3956: Wow congratulations we are happy
14/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Thank you so much sir😊👏
14/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Sir can we schedule the session at 3 pm 
Since it's a Sundae 👏👏
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lordwell!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Afternoon sir how are you today
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes we managed to go through my offer letter ,l am available for the session sir
15/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 621 5516: As for my surname it was mistakenly written sir ,it's MTIKANI not Mikani ......thank you👏
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, we will get it corrected from the side of the university please. Moving ahead, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 621 5516: okkay sir Get well soon sir ,Greetings of the day

1. 1000 USD
2.  4 years
3.  300 usd
4.  100 usd
15/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the wish ☺️
15/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $1000 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $2000. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 621 5516: you are welcome sir
15/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 621 5516: indeed this is clear and straight forward!
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 621 5516: okkay thank you sir 
We will opt for the off Campus
15/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, you can do that please! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir we are together
15/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Sir may l kindly ask! 
So for all the universities you applied for me ,this was the only University that gave me an offer letter?
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir that's clear
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Right now it's more clearer sir👏
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 78 621 5516: no sir l am not aware of the transfer
15/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Thank you so much sir l got the idea now👏
15/10/23, 10:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, I believe you are clear about how the admission process will be carried out, right?
15/10/23, 11:40 pm - +263 78 621 5516: now it's a clear procedure sir
16/10/23, 12:00 am - +263 71 238 3956: How are you sir what is the due date for paying the $750 registration fee and how are we going to pay it
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that please. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 621 5516: l  am well ,how are you sir
16/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 621 5516: indeed we are clear on that one
16/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Yes sir we can move on
16/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 621 5516: how was your day
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lordwell!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: It was very fine dear, let us now move ahead with our discussion. Moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 238 3956: Yes we're good sir
17/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 238 3956: Good afternoon sir we're doing well sir and how are you sir
17/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
17/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*

18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lordwell!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 621 5516: Afternoon sir how are you today
18/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 238 3956: Ok sir thank you so much
18/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 238 3956: We will contact him soon enough
18/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 621 5516: yes sir we stay in Harare in Chitungwizaa
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was going through your admission file and I noticed that you made the payment of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles via Mukuru. So, if you wish to use Mukuru for the payment of your registration fee, you can do that as well through the Mukuru Account of our associates in Africa. Now, while making the payment through Mukuru, you have two options, either you can do it via Mr. Charles for which the transfer charges will be 12.5% of the amount that you will be transferring, or you can do it through Mr. Rajan, for which the transfer charges would be 7% of the amount that you will be transferring. So, shall I share the Mukuru Account Details with you as well?
19/10/23, 12:12 am - +263 71 238 3956: Let me use Mr .Rajan thank you
19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lordwell!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

23/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?

I hope you are having a fine morning today. I reached out yesterday for an update regarding the payment of the first part of your university registration fee. However, my message was left unseen and unattended. Additionally, the payment receipt was not shared with me.

As your admission officer, I have worked my best to extend your offer letter until the end of this month to make you retain this letter and secure your seat. Hence, I would like to give you good news that your university has extended the deadline until the end of this month, which is tomorrow, and after that, they will be closing the round of applications for this month. If you happen to miss this, I am afraid I won't be able to help you out. Hence, may I know your current preparations as of now?
