20/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
20/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I do remember thank you

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes they are so excited and we are all on the same page
20/09/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/09/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/09/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I have received
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes clear
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes it does thank you
20/09/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes it does
20/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 961 8360: OK thank you
21/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Good afternoon ,I am fine thank you
21/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes am ready
21/09/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 961 8360: I am not aware
21/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Oky thank you
21/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Usually at 3 , I will still be at school so I am finding it hard to get in touch with you
22/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 961 8360: OK thank you
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Am sorry I couldn't make it for the session i was at school
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 961 8360: I am not ready , I am still at school
26/09/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, dear. May I know if your parents are available with us?
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 961 8360: They are not available
26/09/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, then, dear. May I know by when you might be available to proceed with the session?
26/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 961 8360: By 6 pm
26/09/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know when you are available so that we can further proceed with the session.
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 7:28 am - +263 71 961 8360: My network was down ,sorry I couldn't make it
27/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 961 8360: My apologies , was still in school
27/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I am
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 11:21 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I understand
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Good afternoon ,  my apologies I am still at school
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. MAy I know if your parents are available with us for the session?
04/10/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Bethel . 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
04/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 961 8360: I am sorry, I am still in school again
04/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you might be available this evening at 7:30 PM?
04/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Oky
04/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Good evening  Mr.shivjeet
04/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Am sorry I couldn't make it due to network problems
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. It is alright. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I am available
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now,  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes
05/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes clear
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes
05/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career.

18/10/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

19/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*


When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in October 2023, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
19/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 768 5647: Greetings how are you

19/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
19/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 768 5647: Yes ready
19/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.

15/11/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if answer to question 1 is correct?
15/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 961 8360: 900 after scholarship
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes it does
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Oky thank you

21/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 961 8360: Good morning I am a proud Edoofian
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 961 8360: It's okay
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 961 8360: I am ready
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that now with further continuation. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes thank you
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes clear
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cAlright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes we are together
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yea it is clear
21/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Yes. I am in Harare
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Okay thank you
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 961 8360: Oky
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve teh details.

23/11/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Bethel. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Bethel!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Bethel.

I hope you are doing well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end to have a productive conversation. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by today, 28th November 2023. However, it has been a few days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
