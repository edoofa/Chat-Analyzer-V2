14/10/23, 7:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

14/10/23, 7:22 am - +263 77 269 8788: Good morning 
Rufaro is still at school starting her final examination on Monday.
14/10/23, 8:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Rufaro may face some difficulties in attending our session due to Exam activities. I kindly request both you and Rufaro to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

17/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before we commence our discussion, I would like to reiterate an update to you about my operational hours, which span from *2:00 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*. I kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots. 

Our discussion sessions have been meticulously organized within these windows to ensure engaging and fruitful conversations. May I safely assume that you've taken note of our designated discussion hours?
17/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes, I have taken note. Also note that during working hours I will be at work.
17/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to see that you've acknowledged our operational hours. Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
17/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes we can proceed,  but that I am the parent and not the student. 

Student is currently writing exams.
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes I confirm its BBA and supposed to start August 2024
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
17/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Unfortunately I had travelled out on a work assignment but can send the documents  tomorrow when I get back home
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Sending the documents once you're back home is absolutely fine.
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the mean time shall we proceed with the session.
17/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes of course
17/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Ok
17/10/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
17/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes, you went through the three steps with Rufaro the student but I was not participating. 

I propose that you wait for Rufaro who is finishing exams on 3 November so that you go through the processes.
17/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
18/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 379 8383: As I indicated earlier Rufaro is currently writing exams and finishing on 3 November. 

I am kindly appealing that we wait for her since as parents work assignments are taking most of our time. We are finding it difficult to focus on the sessions.
18/10/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. May I know if you could suggest a time for the session when you might be available?
21/10/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Rufaro!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. As per my recent question, may I know if you could suggest a time for the session when you might be available?
21/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Afternoon. I had suggested we wait for rufaro since I am pressed on time
23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Rufaro!

I can understand that, and we can do that too. However, there are certain benefits that Edoofa has to offer that I would be glad to share with you. Please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session and discuss these benefits.
25/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Very well. It's a good evening  indeed
25/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes we can
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Certainly we will very excited
25/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Thank you
25/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Ready and excited
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
25/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Have read through the benefits
25/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 379 8383: This is great
25/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Huge savings in this case
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes it does
25/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Well understood. Its clear.
25/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 379 8383: I need more information on this
25/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon.

I will be concluding our session for the day and look forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow, starting from 3:00 PM. Additionally, I will also be available in the evening from 7:30 PM onward. In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful evening, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Thank you.  Good night
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Currently busy can we have the session at 730
26/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall connect at the said time frame.
26/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes I am ready
26/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Agreed
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 379 8383: It's clear
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Very clear
26/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Noted
26/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 379 8383: So far so good. No queries to this stage
26/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Rufaro's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Rufaro is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
26/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Yes am looking forward to the next steps
26/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Rufaro's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 379 8383: Thank you
26/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that the documents are yet to be share please do shar it with me early tomorrow so that I can share the same with the university officials to proceed with the scholarship application.

I'm glad to receive this from you!!
I will be available tomorrow at 12pm to discuss
Thank you
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rufaro,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Good day Shivjeet!
I once again thank you for your efforts in finding me this University.
We may begin
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm thrilled to hear your enthusiasm, and I appreciate your kind words. Let's indeed begin our discussion. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yes
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 378 3220: 1. 900USD
2. 3 years
3. 300USD
4.  750USD
15/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yes totally
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University - <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Understood <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yessir
15/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that @263773783220 . Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Clear!
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Together!
15/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yessir
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Clear
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yessir
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 378 3220: That is okay
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: . Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Good day @918384048513 
I'm still very grateful for your efforts in finding Galgotias University for me. 
Throughout the day, I was carrying out some research on the University to ensure my safety and to make sure that it is a university where I can reach my maximum potential without any troubles. 

I managed to look on the internet and ask a few friends, and family, who have been in India or are still in India about Galgotias. 

I managed to discover that Galgotias is unfortunately not in the top 100 schools ranked by the NIRF(National Institutional Ranking Framework) by the Indian Government and that was a worry to me as this has to do with the overall quality of my education and the accreditation of my degree which I would like to persue.
 
Because of this,my heart dropped as I imagined being in one of the best universities in India as you once assured me as a fellow Edoofian. 

I went on to ask a few friends and family like I mentioned earlier and their reviews on the University weren't as lovely. Out of 5 stars it got an average of 3 stars from my friends and family who seemed not to enjoy the idea of me going to Galgotias.

Additionally, as I calculated the costs involved in coming to India they approximately reached a whooping 2000USD and this is without living expenses, let alone costs of getting a visa or passport. My parents and I were very disappointed because this is very expensive for us. 

Im really thankful, but I'd like to ask if there are any other Universities I could get so I can also compare and contrast with my parents through research. 

Your efforts are very appreciated
Thank you!
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concerns with me.

16/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Sure
16/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now coming to this.  If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.
17/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Yessir
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. So, would you please let me know if we are still connected with this session so that we can conclude our session for the day?@263773783220
17/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 378 3220: My parents will answer the questions concerning the admission process as they know the payment process better
17/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely they can answer anytime. In the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Rufaro!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
18/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 378 3220: Yes sir. There is a major challenge. Mr parents are not curr available to help answer the questions
18/11/23, 9:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand you can discuss them at your convenience, but for you to have a better understanding, completion of this offer letter discussion is mandatory. Shall we proceed with the session?
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

May I know if you are on the same page here?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Rufaro !

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter.
23/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
25/11/23, 8:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Rufaro!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So shall we proceed?
25/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 378 3220: Yes definitely!
My only worry was my queries which you too overlooked
25/11/23, 10:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed. I have also mentioned here that  "Regarding your concerns, I'd like to let you know that most, if not all, of them, will become clear once we complete this session and gain insights. Shall we proceed with the session in the meantime?"
25/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 378 3220: Yes
25/11/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
25/11/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/11/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
25/11/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
25/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 378 3220: Yes understood!!!
25/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
25/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Rufaro!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 378 3220: We may proceed
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
27/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 378 3220: I'm still very grateful for your efforts in finding Galgotias University for me. 
Throughout the day, I was carrying out some research on the University to ensure my safety and to make sure that it is a university where I can reach my maximum potential without any troubles. 

I managed to look on the internet and ask a few friends, and family, who have been in India or are still in India about Galgotias. 

I managed to discover that Galgotias is unfortunately not in the top 100 schools ranked by the NIRF(National Institutional Ranking Framework) by the Indian Government and that was a worry to me as this has to do with the overall quality of my education and the accreditation of my degree which I would like to persue.
 
Because of this,my heart dropped as I imagined being in one of the best universities in India as you once assured me as a fellow Edoofian. 

I went on to ask a few friends and family like I mentioned earlier and their reviews on the University weren't as lovely. Out of 5 stars it got an average of 3 stars from my friends and family who seemed not to enjoy the idea of me going to Galgotias.

Additionally, as I calculated the costs involved in coming to India they approximately reached a whooping 2000USD and this is without living expenses, let alone costs of getting a visa or passport. My parents and I were very disappointed because this is very expensive for us. 

Im really thankful, but I'd like to ask if there are any other Universities I could get so I can also compare and contrast with my parents through research. 

Your efforts are very appreciated
Thank you!

27/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I truly appreciate your dedication to researching Galgotias University and sharing your concerns. Your energetic effort is commendable, and it's essential to make an informed decision about your education.

I completely understand your desire to explore other universities for comparison. It's crucial to weigh all aspects, from academic quality to financial feasibility.
27/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, Galgotias is recognized for providing quality education and is without any doubt better than the education standard of the University of Zimbabwe. While perceptions can vary, I am certain that the facts are something we both can rely on. Hence, I want to ensure that you have accurate and detailed information.

Could you please share who mentioned that the quality of education at Galgotias University is not good? Additionally, if there are specific concerns or factors influencing this perception, it would be helpful to know. This information will enable me to address your concerns more effectively and provide you with the necessary details to make an informed decision.
27/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 378 3220: My research completely praised Galgotias' standards and it's overall review In India was half and half, however, while Galgotias is still a good university, its reputation is mostly within India and not international. It also showed through research that Galgotias has a small alumni network, which means I'll probably have problems when looking for a job after graduation and that really puts my future plans which we discussed in my counselling sessions into shambles.
27/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply Rufaro, I completely understand the significance of choosing a university that aligns with your career goals.

28/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. Please excuse me for the late arrival. How are your days going?
29/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
29/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Hello. We are all well this afternoon
29/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As your admission officer, I have worked my best to extend your offer letter until the end of this month to make you retain this letter and secure your seat. Hence, I would like to give you good news that your university has extended the deadline until the end of this month, which is tomorrow, and after that, they will be closing the round of applications for this month. If you happen to miss this, I am afraid I won't be able to help you out and you would lose out on this opportunity.
29/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But for this, I would also need your help. Hence, could you please provide me with an update on the minimum amount that you were able to gather for your registration fees to meet the deadline for tomorrow and we can discuss the remaining amount next month?

Giving this update to the university officials will help me convince them to secure the seat for you so that you can be a part of your friends coming to India for their dream. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Unfortunately, my parents are unable to gather the funds for the admission into Galgotias however ,we thank you for you all your efforts that you have put in for us. Maybe, another opportunity will rise as time goes on.
29/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your update and your family's efforts in trying to gather the necessary funds. I understand that the current situation poses financial challenges for you. Your honesty and communication throughout this process have been greatly appreciated.
29/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I don't mind asking may I know is your parents has made any backup plans for you higher education?
29/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 378 3220: We are currently looking forward to the August intake for Zimbabwean universities
29/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad that you shared that. May I know if you would be able to provide me with the cost of education for  Zimbabwean university?
29/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 378 3220: Im not so sure unfortunately
29/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, let me help you explain since you mentioned that in Zimbabwe per semester fees are $400-$500 to be on the safer side let us assume it is $500, now as you must be aware each academic year consists of 2 semesters so that will make your per annum cost of $1000 only for the tuition fee. 

Now, if Rufaro goes to a university he will eventually move out and live close to the university, and for that accommodation, the cost could come up to $50 per month which will make your yearly accommodation cost $600, and moving on to the food, for a decent meal it costs $2 per meal, and for shephard to have 3 meals it will cost him $6 and this will also cost you yearly $600. Plus some miscellaneous costs of the examination fee which can cost up to $150 per annum.
29/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now if we sum up the cost here, $1000 + $600 + $600 + $150 = $2350, and this will be the balance if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for shephard to make him employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education Shephard will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
29/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
