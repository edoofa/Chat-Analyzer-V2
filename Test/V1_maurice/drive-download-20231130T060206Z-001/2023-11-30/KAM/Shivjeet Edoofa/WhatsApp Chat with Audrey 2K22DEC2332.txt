18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Thank you noted and have recalled them.
18/10/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
18/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Registration process is whereby the University authorizes a student to be a member of that institution.It includes a process of filling forms such as name of student ,age,sex,course, identity numbers,passes obtained at O and A level ,course applied for among other requirements.
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes we are on the same page ,do we receive offer letters from one institution?

18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes we are ready for this
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok noted
18/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes,I can see the importance of Edoofa in assisting students even without results yet based on previous results.Its a great advantage.
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected? @263715108655
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Benefit 5 is best in our case.
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes we are connected maybe some network delays can delay the response.
18/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Am a little bit lost we want an option whereby she can enroll for 2024 August of which we expect to get her results by February 2024 and subsequently start her degree program by August same year which is the best option for us?
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is the case where the results may come out unsuccessful. May I know if you are clear?
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok noted.
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Clear now
18/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted .
18/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted
18/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Audrey's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Audrey is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes am looking forward for the next step.
18/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Audrey's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok thank you.
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to move on with your admission process, for the process of the offer, I will be requiring the documents. I would like to let you know by when you might be able to share me with the documents?
19/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 510 8655: Morning will try to find the remaining document by weekend latest.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted you can motor-on.
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I shall wait for your reply.
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok almost
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 510 8655: 1- $usd 900
2-5yrs
3-$usd 300
4-$usd750
15/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Very well said.
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the kind words and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted on accommodation but is there room for sharing amongst students to further reduce the costs for example on the off campus USd 800?
15/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, that's a great question. For the off-campus accommodation option costing $800 per annum, students do have the flexibility to share living spaces.

Many students opt for shared accommodation to further reduce costs. You can collaborate with fellow Edoofians by the time of arrival and choose to share a living space, making it a cost-effective arrangement. I hope this is clear to you?
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Crystal clear ,thank you we can proceed.
15/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Very flexible approach which tries to accommodate everyone on board,but however l would like to take you back a little about part four of those questions when is the amount required the 750 us dollars?
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that to be well-discussed very soon, and I am coming to that. So without further ado, shall we move on? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes we can go ahead .
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok noted are there any payments plan on this figure  for example  you say deposit half down this month and the remaining December?
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, there is and I am coming to that now. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Yes you can go ahead.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Very clear and flexible !!!
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 510 8655: We reside in Gweru.
15/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok noted
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Thanks for the contact
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles' FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 510 8655: I think Mr Charles' s method is better since we do not reside in Harare you can send account details then we compare the 2 Methods.
15/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Thank you for the account.We the find the best method for us obviously with less costs .
15/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Sorry to take you back are there other offers from other Universities or  else we deal with this one.
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Sorry for   a response delay  l had  network challenges now it's clear we can proceed .
15/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No problem at all, I understand that technical issues can happen. I'm glad to hear that the information is clear for you. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted with thanks
15/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted thank you
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Interesting but am about to travel back home from work  now which means may delay in responses.
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable. Your schedule and travel plans are important, and I appreciate you taking the time to engage in this discussion.
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 510 8655: If could just explain the EWYL process to clear all doubts.
15/11/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, I'm happy to clarify any doubts you might have about the EWYL process. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is designed to offer financial support to students and their families by allowing them to earn scholarship credits while pursuing their education.
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's a concise breakdown of the EWYL process:

Participation: Students actively engage in the EWYL Program by taking part in various activities or tasks that contribute to the university community or specific projects assigned by the mentors.

Accumulation of Credits: As students participate in these activities, they earn scholarship credits. These credits are a form of financial reward for their contributions.

Credit Redemption: The earned credits can be redeemed to offset a portion of the annual tuition fees. In your case, let's say you earn $1000 in credits. You can use this amount to reduce your annual tuition cost by $1000.

Financial Relief: By utilizing these credits, you effectively reduce the financial burden on your family, making education more affordable.

Continuous Support: Throughout this process, students receive guidance and support from mentors who assist them in navigating both academic and program-related aspects.
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Noted with thanks
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?

22/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 524 8850: I have little access to the internet hence I'm a bit lacking in information regarding the university
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright you can do that anytime. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
22/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 524 8850: Thank you
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
22/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 524 8850: If I fail to secure my scholarship seat will there be no other offer letters from other universities?0
22/11/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges that led to that query, dear?
22/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 524 8850: To be honest I think it might prove to be quite a burden on my parents to secure a scholarship seat in an university we aren't quite sure of yet
22/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 524 8850: I'm sure they can only afford to pay in one we are certain is of choice
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 524 8850: In the event that they pay...there's a chance we might see another university more favorable to my insights and we chose that one ...I don't think our financial abilities are  flexible sir
22/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared you application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
22/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.
22/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
22/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 524 8850: Yes thank you
22/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now may I know if you have any more queries?
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 524 8850: No sir thank you
22/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 524 8850: With pleasure. Have a goodnight sir
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Good evening to you too we can proceed.
23/11/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
23/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok as of now we haven't finalized on the issue of payment of fees If I could reach home and come up with an informed decision it's best.
23/11/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, taking your time to make an informed decision is important. Once you've had the chance to review and finalize the decision regarding the payment of fees, please feel free to reach out.
23/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Thank you.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Audrey!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the second part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Good afternoon to you too we will come back to you once we decide as a family.
27/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's been a while since I shared the details with you and mentioned the payment deadline. During that time, were there any challenges or difficulties you encountered regarding the payment whre you havent had this discussion yet?
28/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Good afternoon in relation to payments of fees we thought they were bound to be paid starting next year hence the process caught us by surprise that is the reason behind our failure to meet the deadline if it were for next time we can plan well ahead but as it stands we are facing financial challenges to meet the dateline but if other Universities respond concerning payments starting next year we can meet set deadlines.
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Audrey!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding the unexpected nature of the fee payment timeline. I understand this caught you by surprise and created financial challenges for your family. I understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in January or February next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted your child to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Thank you for the news
28/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, as your admission offer, I wouldn't want my students to miss out on this opportunity. Hence, I would like to ask to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the end of this month, which is the 30th of November. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Will come back to you tomorrow since there are new developments after seating down with family over the matter.
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your prompt response and for updating me on the current situation. May I know by when you might be able to give me an update by tomorrow?
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Audrey!

I hope you ae having a fine afternoon today. I would like to reach out to you today to for conclusion of your discussion with your family. Hence if there is any update could you please let me know of the same to me. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As your admission officer, I have worked my best to extend your offer letter until the end of this month to make you retain this letter and secure your seat. Hence, your university has extended the deadline until the end of this month, which is tomorrow, and after that, they will be closing the round of applications for this month. If you happen to miss this, I am afraid I won't be able to help you out and you would lose out on this opportunity.
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Good afternoon thank you very much for your effort from this end it seems we have failed to meet the deadline which is tomorrow due to financial constraints.
29/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your update and the transparency regarding the financial constraints faced by your family. I understand the challenges you're encountering. However, my sole responsibility for my prestigious students is to help them secure their dream of higher education abroad, and Audrey is one of my students, and I do not want to miss her out on this journey along with her friend for the intake of 2024. Hence, I will be conveying to the university officials the retaining of the offer letter to secure her seat at the university.

But for this, I would also need your help. Hence, could you please provide me with an update on the minimum amount that you were able to gather for Audrey's registration fees to meet the deadline for tomorrow?

Giving this update to the university officials will help me convince them to secure the seat for Audrey so that she can be a part of her friends coming to India for their dream.
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263715108655 May I know if we are still connected with our conversation?
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Sorry for a late response as it stands we don't have anything in our  coffers.
29/11/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case @263715108655 . May I know if you have made any backup plan for Audrey's higher education ?
