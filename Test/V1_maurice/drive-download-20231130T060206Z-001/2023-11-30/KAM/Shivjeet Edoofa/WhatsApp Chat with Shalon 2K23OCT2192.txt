02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we can
02/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 430 4990: That's fine thank you
02/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes they are thank you
02/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes I am
02/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Very clear indeed thank you
02/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I'm sorry my battery is now very low
02/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know when you might be able to proceed with the session next?

02/11/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright then, shall we reconnect tomorrow in the afternoon from 2:00 PM onwards?

06/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we can thank you
06/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

06/11/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
06/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 430 4990: From video 1 I was pleased to hear that Edoofa equips its students with Life transforming education.There is need for feeling of independence. One should follow instructions and be open minded . From video 2 I learnt that Edoofa's vision is to guide and mentor the parent because sometimes as a parent you can give a harsh judgement so you will assist them to have longer benefits by looking at protocols and policies. The Edoofa also helps in securing a letter of acceptance which amounts to US$1000 for the shipment of the documents
06/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Moving on to video 3 I heard that it requires hardworking from the student so as to pass with flying colours and to invest in the creating system into experiencing high quality education.English is the language to be used as the medium of communication.There is lot of approvals needed so one should express that he or she is the right person for a particular course with the right skills and knowledge required.Edoofa will assist in identifying the right schools.Love, gratitude and friendship is also expressed as well as looking at the infrastructure and accomodation.
06/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Lastly on video 4 I learnt that Edoofa helps in the induction process where a form of the statement of purpose shall be filled in stating one's unique ability, skills and strengths speaking out why you are seeking admission into a particular school.With this I rest my case thank you
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
06/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes I do thank you for sharing such crucial information
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

07/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Shalon. 

How are you doing today?
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 886 5952: 2. *Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference between human rights and civil rights*                                         Rights are defined as claims of an individual that are recognized by society of his or her own. Rights can be priviledges and benefits a person enjoys as a citizen of a state. A right can be a legal entitlement or immunity granted by law. A duty, on the other hand, is something that someone is expected or required to do, and it is also a responsibility the citizen owe the state and their fellow citizens. A duty is different from a right because is an also an obligation (responsibility) that was made within another party (such as employer). In a  nutshell, rights protect us from actions taken by others,  whereas duties are actions we are expected to take in our own lives. Furthermore, Human rights and Civil rights are brought to one's attention by the above. Human rights are rights one requires by being alive while civil rights are obtained by being a legal member of a certain political state. Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country while Human rights are derived from natural law regardless of local legal jurisdiction, and it might include right to life and freedom from torture. Thank you.
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 886 5952: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney? 

Prosecutors are responsible for prosecuting the crime that the accused are being tried for.  One of the distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In contrast an attorney will do the opposite. A defense attorney can accept both criminal and and civil cases . A prosecutor only works on criminal cases that involve property. The  attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence. This means that they will work to provide enough evidence defend the the client who has been accused of criminal charges. If facing a criminal accusation one may feel overwhelmed and worried about what the future holds hence the compassionate defense attorneys will listen carefully to one's needs and goals and work with you to get the positive outcome one deserves. Prosecutors are differentiated from an attorney since they work with the federal government whilst the attorney represents the person accused of crime by government.
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 886 5952: 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, corporate or criminal , and why?

Corporate law because it is a legal practice area specializing in the statutory, regulatory, and ethical standards that apply to corporations.  In practice, corporate law touches on a variety of legal subjects which may include formation of corporations, investments, corporate governance, securities, mergers and acqusutions and dissolution. I am basically interested in this type of law since it helps corporations to understand their legal duties, avoid regulatory enforcement actions and litigation, and safeguard their assets. Without having corporate legal advice to guide them, corporations can easily violate laws and regulations and run into contract and licensing issues, potentially costing them time, money and loss of business. Corporate law is there to help clients to identify a purpose and set out purpose-driven goals that are broader and more meaningful than simply advancing shareholder interests. For example, a corporation may define its purpose as helping customers achieve their dreams empowering underderserved populations, or promoting environmental stewardship. Working toward sales objectives related to those purpose benefit shareholders,  but a strong sense of driven goals ensures buy-in at all levels of the corporation and encourages the prioritization of long-term goals over short-term profits.
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 886 5952: 5. What skills do you believe you have have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an explanation.

Various skills such as communication, teamwork, attention to detail, creative thinking and problem solving  are the skills that l have, and l believe that they will help me become a successful lawyer.

To begin with the communication skills, l am able to make negotioans whereby l believe that l will be able to negotiate settlements, liase with clients and draft contracts using different writing styles and registers in key.
Moreover,  l have the ability to work well in a team. I believe that one needs to be able to work in alongside colleagues and clients productively regardless of whether you become a solicitor, barrister or paralegal. I have come up to learn that winning cases is a team effort. 
Furthermore,  l give excellent attention to detail. Giving an eye for detail means that l am able to complete my legal research and writing responsibilities,  error free.
Adding on, l am good at problem solving. Practice makes perfect when it comes to problem solving as does being confident in my approach and not being afraid to think outside the box. I can use my own initiative in problem solving. 
Moreover, the creative thinking whereby l am able to apply alternative thinking and coming up with new approaches comes handy when tackling complex or conventional cases.
In summation,  l believe that having these skills equips me with the potential of being a successful lawyer

07/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes that's correct
07/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we can start
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes that's right
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Very correct thank you
07/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we are I am following thank you
07/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
07/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
07/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
07/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes I have thank you
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
07/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Well understood thank you
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes you may elaborate on how the process will be tackled
07/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it will be wel explained from now on. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
07/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 430 4990: This is fantastic thank you for sharing
07/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
07/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
07/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we are thank you
07/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
07/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
07/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes we can move on
07/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 430 4990: That's great news thank you
07/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Oh! yes thank you
07/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes thank you
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I am following and you are clearly explaining it thank you
07/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 430 4990: May you please shade more light thank you
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
07/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Now it is clear thank you
07/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes I do agree thank you
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes thank you
07/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
07/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes thank you
07/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 430 4990: No thank you we can move forward
07/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
07/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes of course that's our main worry thank you
07/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
07/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
08/11/23, 7:13 am - +263 77 430 4990: Well appreciated with great enthusiasm thank you
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Shalon.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I understand that it will really work that way let's proceed thank you
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Tuition fee per annum is $3500, accomodation $800, annual fee at MVN is $5550, sports and miscellaneous fee is $250 and the Admission and processing fee is$57. Thank you
17/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if these are fees after the scholarship?
17/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 430 4990: That's my understanding l stood to be corrected if I wrongly understood it.Thank you
17/11/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Sorry I noticed that I gave you the wrong figures here are the correct ones tuition $350.Admission575, Accomodation $0, annual fee $1600 misc and sports $250
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Now in the same boat thank you
17/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes it is affordable
17/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1350 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1600.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1350 . I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I see it's less burden now
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Shalon's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes it is becoming more clear now thank you
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes it is very clear thank you
17/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 430 4990: That's awesome I will encourage her to take it seriously so as to lessen the financial burden
17/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I have noticed that the program is advantageous in adjusting financial strain if one takes it seriously and works effectively on it thank you
17/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 430 4990: That's great I understand
17/11/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Correction the fee mentioned here as $1500 should be $1600*
17/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 430 4990: I get it thank for the correction
17/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Very clear enough thank you
18/11/23, 8:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Shalon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am happy to hear that. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
18/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 430 4990: Morning how are you .l am available
18/11/23, 10:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
18/11/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 430 4990: Yes you may explain to be more clear thank you
18/11/23, 11:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 11:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023*.
18/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 430 4990: I opt for the first one of the instalments
18/11/23, 11:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 11:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 430 4990: No I work in the remote part of Zimbabwe in Manicaland Province
18/11/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Ok thank you I will contact him
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Ok thank you I will take the precautions
18/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Ok using the Ecocash way seem to be simpler you may share the details thank you
18/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles EcoCashis a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

20/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you mentioned LPU; it is indeed one of our associated universities. I would like to know how you came across LPU and why you prefer it?
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 886 5952: I came across LPU when l was asked by Mr Austin to contact some of my beneficiaries, and l had a chat with Persistance Muza, hence l had  a great interest since he shared some videos of LPU
20/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the same it is indeed inspiring. The university scholarship application works on a Merit system. As of now, your application has been accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with LPU university as well, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or arrive unsuccessful.
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 886 5952: No, you are not clear. Can you please elaborate?
20/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! When it comes to the registration fee, you can customize it based on the university you prefer. As an Edoofian, you have the advantage of adjusting this fee according to your chosen university. This is one of the perks we offer to make education more affordable and give you more options. Do you have any questions or is everything clear so far?
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Everything is clear.

I hope you are having a fine afternoon. Our DSW (Department of Student Welfare) Team recently had a trip to MVN University this week. During their visit, they had a good time interacting with the students and managed to capture glimpses of your senior colleagues who have enrolled at MVN University this year for the 2023 intake. I wanted to share this information with you to let you know that they had a great time with the DSW team.
