29/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen hope you are well .I go by the name Tawananyasha Gondo and I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to tell you about myself .I am a girl aged 17 and I’m currently doing lower 6 at Christ Ministries in Harare and the subjects I’m studying are mathematics, biology and chemistry.

 I live with my mother my father passed away so she had been raising me well by herself since I was a baby and that only gives me the thirst to succeed in life so that I can our lives completely. At the moment she is an accountant at Earthen Fire which is in Msasa .I look up to her a lot because she is hardworking and is the reason why I am the person I am today. She has always been a mentor to me since day one she had motivated me to be at my best .Personally I think I’m an interesting person to be around and I am always keen to do something new, researching ,analysing data and learning new things.

In an addition, I also see myself as an ambitious person,very focused ,responsible, hard working, As far as my academic performances are concerned  I always do my best and strive to take the highest position .I want to make a difference in my life and prove to myself that I can reach any height as long as I’m focused .

Most importantly that my success is not determined by my background.My goal since I was a child was to study abroad and to be part of the medical field as a Lab Technologist. I do not only want to end there but I also want to open.my own Laboratories in Zimbabwe which are as good as the ones we see in developed countries .

My aim is to help other people so that they do not need to go abroad for their tests due to the lack of particular facilities  that are currently in Zimbabwe .

When I was doing my research I made a realization that India is the best place to study for my degree which will be Bachelor of science in medical laboratory technology for it is well known for its top notch education system.In conclusion, I hope that I will get the opportunity to go to India so that my dreams may be brought to life .
