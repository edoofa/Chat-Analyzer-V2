01/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 887 6246: my problem is also reaching the contact that you had said assists in the payment, he is in Harare and i am in Bulawayo, and i also fear that now i will literally be steering the payments on my own and fear i might not be able to pay this full amount on time by myself.
01/08/23, 11:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Hamadziripi!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/08/23, 11:50 am - Milan Edoofa: I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
01/08/23, 11:50 am - +263 71 798 2528: Good morning sir we are well, how about you
01/08/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well please, thank you for asking.
01/08/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 798 2528: My pleasure sir
01/08/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: So, Hamadziripi, can you please also let me know of this as well dear?
01/08/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 798 2528: Sir l would be lying if l said l new much , that's my aunt's place
01/08/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well dear, can you please come again?
01/08/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 887 6246: good day, i do not have the confidence that i would have USD800 by the 7th of August 2023
01/08/23, 12:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263778876246 Here we are not discussing about making the full payment please. I am advising you to make the payment of the $200 that you have saved for Hamadziripi's admission till now and then once it would be done, we would have secured his seat for the scholarship. Then moving ahead, we will discuss more about clearing the balance fee and will plan a way ahead for the same. In this way, you won't lose on the scholarship itself.
01/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 798 2528: I was saying sir , l don't noe much
03/08/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 887 6246: <Media omitted>

16/08/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well thank you for asking. I have received an update that the payment of $200 that you made towards your registration fee was confirmed from the side of the accounts team so you can rest assured about that please. 

Moving ahead, can you please let me know how is it that you are planning to complete the payment of the remaining registration fee as well?

02/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 887 6246: Good day, my apologies for not sharing but it Seems like monthends the Internet banking is down, so I need to go and make a withdrawal from my bank and then do a direct deposit into Mr Jerera's account

08/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 887 6246: If you may assist, please advise if there are transaction costs to me using Mr Jerera's account and what percentage is it so dat I also incorporate it in making the payments
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 887 6246: Is 11% the correct International transacting fee?
08/11/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for asking that question. Moving ahead, when it comes to the transfer charges, it would be 11% of the total amount. This means that for the total registration fee of $1000, it would be $110. Hence, the total amount becomes $1000 + $110 = $1110.

Now, since you have already paid $750 towards your registration fee, the balance that remains to be cleared is $1110 - $750 = $360. I hope this is clear?
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 887 6246: Yes, very clear thank you very much

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
