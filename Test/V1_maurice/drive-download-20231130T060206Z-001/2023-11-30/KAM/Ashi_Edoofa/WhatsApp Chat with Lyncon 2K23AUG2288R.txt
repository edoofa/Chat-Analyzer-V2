28/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
28/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?

28/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
28/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 09.00 pm?
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 828 4088: I have gone through this video i understand
28/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you have gone through the video then I shall wait for your response.
28/08/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 828 4088: I have gone through this one too
28/08/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can share your understanding of the 4 videos, once you have gone through all the videos at once.
28/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 828 4088: The videos where just explaining on how they help people reach their goals in life
28/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 828 4088: And the guide us through our learning so that we can have a better and higher education
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/08/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 828 4088: OK thank you sir
28/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
28/08/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok sir thank you
28/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
28/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

29/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Tourism boost my country because it creates job opportunity, it strengthens the local economy, reduce poverty and inequality and i also develops the country. They are five important skills which are needed on a tour operator which are communication skills, punctuality, a good sense of humor, impeccable time management and customer services skill. Categories which a tour guide comes across are sports, recreation and leisure, explore their special interest or hobbies and eco_tourist. My own understanding about the travel and hospitality industry is that thre is a vast sector that includes all the economic activities that directly or indirectly contribute to, or depend upon, travel and tourism.

29/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 828 4088: 2. Tourism boost my country because it creates job opportunity for people without jobs. It also strengthens the local economy because when foreigner visit our country, they come to see and learn about our natural and national site therefore it boost the country because they bring foreign currency and it helps in boosting the economy of the country. Tourism helps in developing the country by reducing poverty and inequality because they will be employment creation which gives people opportunity to work and look after their families
29/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 828 4088: 3. The five characteristics of a great tour operator are 
An in-depth understanding of the subject matter, top-notch communication skills, a good sense of humor, punctuality, and impeccable time management — all these qualities make up an effective tour guide and help contribute to a professional tour.
29/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 828 4088: 4. Categories which a tour guide comes across.
Tour guides accompany groups of visitors to tourist attractions, whether on day trips or longer visits, and give them information and insights that help them make the most of the experience. Potential tour guides should be fit and healthy with lots of energy and confidence.
29/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 828 4088: 5. In my own understanding The hospitality and tourism industry is a vast sector that includes all the economic activities that directly or indirectly contribute to, or depend upon, travel and tourism. This industry sector includes: Hotels & Resorts. Restaurants & Catering.
29/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*

29/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
29/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
30/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 828 4088: Goodmorning Mrs kirti
30/08/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Lyncon.

I hope you are doing well, since we could not continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
30/08/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
30/08/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
30/08/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/08/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
30/08/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
30/08/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 828 4088: So i have to accept at one university
30/08/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
30/08/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
30/08/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
30/08/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes sir
30/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
30/08/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Oka
30/08/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Y
30/08/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
30/08/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
30/08/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 828 4088: How much will be covered by the scholarship
30/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, let me help you understand. The above-assumed example is the amount that the scholarship will cover, followed by the Earn While You Learn Program, you can further reduce the cost by earning scholarship credits.

I hope you are clear?
30/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
30/08/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in August 2023. Considering the fact that we start with the EWYL on Monday as informed to you before, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Monday which is 4th September 2023.
30/08/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
30/08/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our discussion for today at 2:30 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this discussion. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
30/08/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
30/08/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 02.30 pm.
30/08/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay thank you
30/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
30/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Thank you sir
30/08/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome,
30/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Afternoon kirti
30/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773442464, I am glad to see that you are on time and so punctual for our discussion, if you are available shall we start with the discussion?
30/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
30/08/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now Before moving forward I would like to ask if you have any queries or concerns regarding the admission process?
30/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yez
30/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 344 2464: No
30/08/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
30/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 828 4088: No
30/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Im not aware
30/08/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Lyncon, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pau would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
30/08/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
30/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
30/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 828 4088: I understand
30/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 828 4088: So the proposal will come through my Gmail
30/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Account
30/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Thank you
30/08/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We shall explain you more about this, in the meantime please be patient, and let us continue with the discussion, shall we?
30/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
30/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes I do
30/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
30/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.
2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.
3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.
4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/08/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.
6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.
7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
30/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok ok I understand
30/08/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
30/08/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok sir
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes sir
30/08/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/08/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
30/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/08/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know you were able to go through this message?
30/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 344 2464: What is the deadline for Lyncon provided that we just paid the acceptance fee   recently
30/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773442464 Yes, I understand, Please do not worry the above dates are an assumption for your understanding as we move forward each and every query will be covered, Please be patient.
30/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok sir
30/08/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Provide with more information
30/08/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
30/08/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
30/08/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
30/08/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A-Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, This means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
30/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
30/08/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes ido
30/08/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
30/08/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for 
another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes i am
30/08/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for her exams and starting with her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
30/08/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/08/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes August 2024 its okay
30/08/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
30/08/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay i understand
30/08/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
30/08/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Lets move on i understand
30/08/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect on Friday at 01.00 p.m. To carry forward your admission process.
30/08/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Thank you
30/08/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 828 4088: I will have a word with them
30/08/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great day and convey my regards to your family as well.
30/08/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay i will
02/09/23, 9:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Lyncon.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you and your parents are available to connect with us today?
02/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 828 4088: Yes we are
02/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 344 2464: Yes mrng Kirti
02/09/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773442464, I hope you are doing well.
02/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 344 2464: Am doing fyne thanks
02/09/23, 9:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
02/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
02/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
02/09/23, 9:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. It would be great if you could let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts regarding the same?
02/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 828 4088: All is good because the benefits are there to help me
02/09/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now let us move forward with our discussion I hope @263773442464 will be active in the discussion.
02/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
02/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Great, now I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
02/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
02/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
02/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 828 4088: Okay thank yousir
02/09/23, 10:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
02/09/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
02/09/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
02/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 828 4088: I have to ask my father
02/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 828 4088: He will talk to you about it
02/09/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, may I know when will he be available for the discussion?
02/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 828 4088: On Monday
02/09/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
04/09/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lyncon.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier as it was the weekend, I want to inform you that we will be having our discussion today at 09.00 pm, I hope you will be available.
04/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes we will be available
04/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes i am
04/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Hie Kirti
04/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @263773442464. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, since I was occupied with some personal work we will be connecting on the 6th of September at 01.30 pm since I will not be available tomorrow on the occasion of my Birthday. I hope you will be available.
04/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 344 2464: It's ok
04/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
06/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 06th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 21st of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay i understand
06/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Oky
06/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
06/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
06/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
06/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
06/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 06th of September, the deadline becomes the 21st of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 06th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 21st of September 2023, making the second deadline the 21st of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
06/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 828 4088: So the other money i will pay nextyear if i come there
06/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, the registration fee is required to be paid so that you can reserve your seat with the university, once you have registered yourself with the university any further expense will be paid only when you arrive in India in August 2024. I hope we are clear here?
06/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes i am. Thank you for explaining to me
06/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do let me know if you have any queries and if you are clear with the two admission procedures?
06/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 828 4088: OK
06/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
06/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 344 2464: 750 then deadline 21st September
06/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you are absolutely correct and this is the Standard Admission Process, may I know if you recall the 2 admission processes that were discussed as of today?
06/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Standard Registration /University Admission process
06/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Early Registration /University Admission process
06/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay so i will tell my father to pay the money
06/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Its 600
06/09/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I think you have misunderstood, let me help you understand again @263788284088.

If you wish to go by the Standard Admission Process then you would be required to pay $750 as per the deadline of 21st September after you receive the offer letter from the University, however, if you wish to go by the Early Decision Benefits, you will be required to pay $600 which can be paid in two parts by the deadlines, of $300 on 21st of September 2023 and the remaining $300 on the 21st of October 2023. Alternatively, if you are sure that you are mentally and financially prepared to pay the registration fee of $600 at once, you can also do that, with the given deadline of 21st September 2023 after receiving your offer letter.

I hope you are clear now?
06/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay i think we can go with the early decision benefits of paying 300 in September the the last 300 in October
06/09/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
06/09/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since you stated that you wish to continue with the early decision benefits and as the name suggests the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *21st September* and *21st October*.
06/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
06/09/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*21st September* and *21stOctober*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Lyncon's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
06/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok
06/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 828 4088: They are
06/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great @263773442464 so could you please give us a (green light/ go ahead ) for Lyncon's application for the scholarship?
06/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 344 2464: We have already paid the 200 us for the scholarship
06/09/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773442464 I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $500- $750 registration fee is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. And we have an early decision benefit for you as well in the month of September 2023, as explained above.

I hope you are clear now?
06/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok I understand
06/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay all is clear
06/09/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great @263773442464 so could you please give us a (green light/ go ahead ) for Lyncon's application for the scholarship?
06/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
06/09/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are giving us a go-ahead for Lyncon's application for the scholarship if yes then I would like you to please say a go-ahead @263773442464 ?
06/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Go ahead
06/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 344 2464: ✅
06/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Lyncon's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Lyncon's higher education well.
06/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 344 2464: No I don't have any queries
06/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ok thanks Kirti
06/09/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
11/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see your excitement please. Now, may I know if you have gone through the offer letter by now?
11/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
11/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 828 4088: But i haven't received it in my email
11/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, you would be receiving the same on your mail shortly. For now, let us move ahead to discuss the letter.
11/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
11/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Is 1000 us if im on a scholarship
11/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
11/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lyncon, please answer these questions as well dear.
11/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Hotel fees there is 3 seater with mess thats 1250 and 4 seater with mess its 1000
11/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Thenmy registration fees is 750
11/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Sorry ma'am for the late reply
11/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 828 4088: My phone's battery died
12/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 435 5345: Hie
12/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 344 2464: Hie Milan Lyncon's father has something to ask if you have time
12/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 435 5345: Is it possible for me to have instalments for the $750 payment. The problem is that the offer letter came at a time we have not yet got our salaries and when we get them they fall far below the required amount
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lyncon!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries and thoughts here, for now, you can stay assured that we will be discussing all these details moving ahead during our conversation. For now, let us move ahead with the same.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1000.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you will have the option to pay the complete per annum fee in installments as well. Now, Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
12/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ithink I would like to choose four seater
12/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Can i ask on the flight payments
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Are we supposed to pay for our flight or we both pay
12/09/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the flight costs, since they are considered to be a student's personal expenses, therefore the parents would have to cater for it.
12/09/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.

In this case, as you want to opt for four-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2000 which can be paid in two parts of $1000 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.

This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
12/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
12/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
12/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2000 and so the balance fee becomes $2000 - $1000 = $1000 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
12/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes i understand
12/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 828 4088: It surely helps
12/09/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
12/09/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2000, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2000 - $750= $1250, and that can be paid in two parts of $625 at a gap of 6 months (August 2024/January 2025). 

Are we on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
12/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
12/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay but you said its 600
12/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the support of the Early Decision Grant of $150 as well as the privilege to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 25th September 2023.*
2. *$300 before 25th October 2023.*
12/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *25th September 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
12/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 828 4088: We were given 2 options which were you paying 150 of 750 and us paying 600 and the gap is 300 until 23 September and the last 300 until 23 October
12/09/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lyncon, may I know if you have gone through this message of mine dear?
12/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes
12/09/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! May I know if you are clear about the deadline date and the payments to be made?
12/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Yes its 25
12/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 828 4088: On both months
13/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lyncon!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that, is right. Now, since you are clear about that, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
13/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Hie Milan we are staying at Marondara
13/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Ithik it's about 100and something kilometres from Harare
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
13/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 828 4088: Okay
13/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
13/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Thank you very much
13/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 344 2464: Yes
13/09/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398

13/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
13/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 344 2464: No
13/09/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
