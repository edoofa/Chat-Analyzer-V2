I am happy to know that you are still ready to communicate that definetly shows your enthusiasm. Let us now discuss your university admission process.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
09/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes we may
09/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 339 0549: We are ready to continue
09/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Noted thank you
09/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Let's move on
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes they are clear
09/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Very clear
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
09/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes we are following
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes they are clear
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes we may
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Go ahead and share
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 220 4972: The network is very poor was trying to watch the first one but it's taking time 
I think it will be quite effective that we schedule for tomorrow morning since the network is more effective during the night
09/10/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand the network issues you're facing, and I appreciate your patience. Scheduling for tomorrow morning when the network tends to be more effective sounds like a reasonable plan. Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 02:30 pm?
09/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:30 pm.
10/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Memory.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good afternoon. Sorry for late response. I was busy with other duties. I am not sure why Memory is not responding. Maybe  it's network issues
10/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I personally was busy and had not had the time to go through the vedios
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your message. It's understandable that sometimes network issues or other commitments can make it challenging to respond promptly. As for Memory, it's possible that network problems are preventing her from responding. It's essential to consider such technical difficulties.
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding the videos, may I know by when will you be able to go through them since Memory is unable to connect with us now?
10/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I am sorry for the hiccups. I am committed elsewhere for now. I can only listen to them after 7 pm tonight. I am sorry I thought Memory would do this.
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. I understand in that case, Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 08:00 pm?
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 339 0549: It depends on network speed.  But I will try my best to be able to do that
10/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 08:00 pm.

10/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I did not manage to listen to the videos. Seems Memory can't connect as well due to erratic network connection
10/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the electricity and network issues. It can be challenging to stay connected in such situations. In that case, will you be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 02:30 pm?

12/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I am ready to move on
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Agreed
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 339 0549: True this was discussed but I missed the point that it is required within two weeks of admission
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 339 0549: It's ok let's move onp
12/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Please do not worry we will help you understand again. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 4:08 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes understood
13/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Understood
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok noted
13/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I think I am clear. Basically after being admitted by the university I pay the registration fees, get an admission acceptance letter, visa acquisition and flying to India. But there is also need to pay half the annual fee within 3 days of arriving in India
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Really interesting. I hope all will move well for our Memory as well. I am worried though with the time frame required to pay the registration fee. I personally thought we will be given more time to do that
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope it works out well for Memory too. I understand your concern about the time frame for paying the registration fee. However, as me move ahead your concern about the time frame will be at ease.
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
13/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes let's move on
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Memory, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok ok interesting. Please go ahead.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 4:04 am - +263 77 339 0549: It's a good advantage
14/10/23, 8:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Memory.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, hence we were unable to get back to you, however, I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
14/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning. Yes I am available.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 339 0549: Let's go ahead with the discussion
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  So may I know if you are clear so far?
14/10/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 339 0549: So far so good. I am home and dry.
14/10/23, 8:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 8:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 339 0549: Oh ok. It's good news really
14/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 339 0549: Quite interesting. We may move on
14/10/23, 8:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 8:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 8:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am very clear. What happens let's say one fails to clear the registration fee in the stipulated time due to circumstances beyond one's control
14/10/23, 9:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, in such a case, the university shall revoke the offer letter, however, if discussed with us and well informed we do discuss the same with the Academic Board and if they consider the reason genuine then they assist us to provide you with a payment plan please, so please do not worry, however, this please understand that it is a very rare consideration.
14/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 339 0549: Understood thank you
14/10/23, 9:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am clear. I hope for the best
14/10/23, 9:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Memory's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Memory is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am excited and hopeful that she will be part of the group for this month
14/10/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am really happy to hear that, looking forward to connecting with her. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 339 0549: I look forward to the offer letter. Thank you so much. Have a blessed day too and I hope the Almighty will guide this process
17/10/23, 11:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Memory,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family!

Keep it up team not only for us but for other deserving families and students. Once again thank you very much

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Very excited and happy as a family. It is our wish to see Memory excel. Yes let's go ahead and discuss the contents of the letter
18/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 339 0549: We may proceed. I had all the time to read and review the letter
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263773390549 and we share the same excitement. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes this works for me. Let's proceed
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is Memory's per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is her per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is her annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are her Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 339 0549: 1. $0
2. $0
3. $1250
4. $250
5. $1000
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details @263773390549. As per Memory's offer letter, MVN University has awarded her a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout her course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in her letter, she has also been awarded a 100% waiver on her accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to her will be free of cost throughout her stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making her education more affordable, isn’t it?
18/10/23, 11:18 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes it is
19/10/23, 8:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see we are together @263773390549. Moving forward, as you can see in Memory's offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, her remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 8:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600. I hope we share the same calculation and are together in our discussion so far?
19/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am a bit lost on the tuition fee. I thought it was fully sponsored. Please enlighten me on that
19/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 339 0549: So I thought the tuition fee is $0 instead of $350
19/10/23, 12:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you, @263773390549, for bringing this to my attention. I sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by the incorrect information I shared. To clarify and ensure we are on the same page, let me provide a detailed breakdown once again.

The tuition fee for your child's course at MVN University is indeed fully sponsored, which means there is no tuition fee cost. I apologize for the earlier message that incorrectly mentioned a tuition fee of $350. That was a mistake on my part.
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Your child's education at MVN University is covered, and you won't have to pay any tuition fees. Your diligence in reviewing the details is greatly appreciated and to ensure that we are on the same page, I have reshared the message with you below.
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you can see in Memory's offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that Memory's per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means Abdul's total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Abdul's annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok thank you this is clarified. I guess the name Abdul is an error. We are talking about Memory. Thank you for the clarification. We may proceed
19/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I guess there is an error here as well. 
$575+$300+$125 = $1000. If we then add EDP and Book bank fee it sums up to $1250 which will be the annual cost of education not $1500.
19/10/23, 1:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this information, @263773390549. However, I am a bit confused by the message you've provided. The annual cost of education we mentioned is $1250 for the entire course duration. For the first year, there are one-time payments, including a Sports Fee of $125 and a Miscellaneous Fee of $125. 

This means that Memory's total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $125 (Sports Fee) + $125 (Miscellaneous Fee) = $1500. From the second year onwards, the cost reverts to $1250.

I would like to confirm if you were able to read my entire message. It's possible that I may have misunderstood your question. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok noted. It was an error on my part. I had not included the sports fee as well as the Misc fee. We may proceed.
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and I am comfortable to know that we're on the same page now and can proceed with our discussion. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Memory's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how Memory can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Impressive. Very exciting
19/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 339 0549: If you are ready to continue the discussion I am here. We can go ahead
19/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I am interested in knowing how the EWYL comes into play
19/10/23, 1:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263773390549, I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Memory's total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.
19/10/23, 1:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 1:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 1:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Very clear and interesting indeed
19/10/23, 1:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Memory with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 1:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 1:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Memory can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes yes. By the way what kind of projects/work will they be involved in
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 339 0549: And by the way when do we expect the Admission letter from MVN University for Visa processing?
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these queries with me, let me attend to both of them one by one -
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you are aware that the Earn While You Learn Program is an initiative by the Edoofa Program for the students enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program to help them make their education affordable, and at the same time, help them learn the relevant industry skills. 

Each student enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program will be a part of the EWYL Program as well. Throughout the EWYL Journey, a student learns various skills such as networking skills, writing skills, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and community building.
19/10/23, 2:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The EWYL Projects that are assigned to the students are designed in a way students start preparing themselves for the actual jobs in the industry and guide them to be on the right path to becoming young professionals. 

Keeping in mind, the industrial requirements and to help them attain the skills I mentioned, the EWYL team has designed 3 projects for them which remain the same throughout their journey, and based on one dedication and performance, the students are assigned more projects. 

Once a student starts with their EWYL Program, they will be allotted an EWYL Mentor who will guide them better. An EWYL Mentor's core responsibility is to guide his/her students on the projects allocated to them, ensure they are working hard and earning credits, and at the same time focus on the skills they will need in the industry. I hope this addresses the first query you had?
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I am clear
19/10/23, 3:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. Regarding your second query, the Admission Acceptance Letter is issued by the university once a student pays the entire registration fee. It is based on this letter that the visa application process can be initiated. The ideal timeline for students to begin the visa application process would be in the month of February since the student's arrival is planned for August 2024.
19/10/23, 3:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Talking about the registration fee, let's turn our focus to the registration fee outlined in Shantelle's offer letter. As mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in her offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after she arrives in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of her arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I thought basing on our previous discussions that the registration fee formed part of the tuition fee and I was assuming since this was fully sponsored it fell away.
19/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 339 0549: $1000 is a lot of money to raise in 15 days even in two months in an economy like Zimbabwe. Are there no other ways of spreading payment of this money given that the student is starting her education in August 2024.
19/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Just thinking. Because I had been assured that the registration fee would not be above $750.
19/10/23, 4:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for bringing this query to my attention, @263773390549. Allow me to address it and provide you with the clarity you seek.
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost, as we discussed in my previous message. For Memory, this cost for her first year of education is $1,500 and thus it will be adjusted toawrds the same.
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, regarding the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned, it's true that you were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
19/10/23, 4:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason your per annum cost of education is only $1,250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Memory's first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose.
19/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I totally understand and agree but my appeal was on payment of the $1000. Is there a possibility of this money being spread over a period of time like maybe 3 to 4 months.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Memory is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that she will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess Memory's scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer Memory has received. Do you not agree with this @263773390549?
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I agree 100%. This is a lifetime opportunity but was just asking in case such allowances exist
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Let us come to that as well @263773390549. As you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*.
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Memory through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I recall. You may explain sure.
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Memory's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Memory's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes we are in agreement.   Will try our best using the first option
20/10/23, 4:06 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I am in Harare
20/10/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 8:03 am - +263 77 339 0549: Noted very helpful thank you
20/10/23, 8:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/10/23, 8:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes for my records please
20/10/23, 8:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263773390549. If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 339 0549: Thank you. Be blessed abundantly.
20/10/23, 8:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am running around to look for the money. Honestly this is a golden chance for Memory and I would suffer a heart attack if she fails to make it. I will strive to pay the $425 before the deadline and also scrounge around to pay end of November. If anything goes wrong I will inform you in advance
20/10/23, 8:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I completely understand your situation, @263773390549. We appreciate your dedication to securing this opportunity for Memory. We will do our best to assist you throughout this process, and I am glad to hear that you're taking the necessary steps to make this happen. If you face any challenges or require support along the way, please feel free to reach out to us. We're here to help, and your commitment to Memory's future is truly commendable. 

Since you do not have any queries as of now, shall we move forward and shall I share the university insights with you?
20/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes please go ahead.
20/10/23, 8:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -
20/10/23, 8:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: MVN University is one of the prestigious universities located in Delhi NCR, India.

20/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 339 0549: Very interesting, thank you
20/10/23, 9:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263773390549. Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing Memory's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/10/23, 9:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as Memory has received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing her one step closer to realizing her dream of pursuing education abroad.
20/10/23, 9:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for Memory's admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am happy so far with the effort and support you have given me and my family so far. If I meet any challenges I will get in touch. Have a good weekend.
20/10/23, 9:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your regards @263773390549. On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed weekend ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
20/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Sorry for bringing this late. What is the status on food in all this? Is food provided by the University or else?
20/10/23, 7:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263773390549 addressing this query of yours, food is not included in the services offered and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this we are together?
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok this is noted. So it means the student must have to budget some money for food. Is that so?
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Memory,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 09:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good evening. Just following up on the discussion we had in the afternoon. As a family we take this opportunity for Memory seriously. I would like to commit myself to a payment plan of $150 a month until this figure of $650 is finished
30/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Memory!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to let you know that Ms. Vilsha could not connect with you here in due time since she is not feeling well and is taking rest till the time she is completely fit. I appreciate your patience here. 

Moving ahead, as you have mentioned that you are planning to go with the $150 plan and will complete the $650 with that, you can surely do that and we will move ahead to discuss this as well. For now, since the deadline for making the payment of your registration fee is of tomorrow, I believe you would be clearing the first part of $200, right?

08/11/23, 5:39 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning. It's good to go hear from you once again. Thank you. From our previous discussion, we had agreed a payment plan of $150 until the remaining balance of $739 is finished. I hope this is still the position. This will then mean that the due date of 30 November 2023 does not apply. May you please clarify on this. Once again thank you.
