26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

26/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok so the first video l understood that students should be reachable and open_minded.Students should follow Edoofa's instructions.

From the second video l understood that the Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEEL program instead students of Edoofa earning and learning to success but it is also focused on increasing student's Capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent.

From the third video l understood that students should understand that Edoofa has invested a lot time ( over 10 years ) to identify good schools and universities of passionate. Moreover, Edoofian's encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious in situations.

As for the last video , l understood that the Statement of Purpose is an important document, student should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form 

In conclusion, overally l understood that a student should listen to instructions and respond appropriately.
26/10/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes David, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/10/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/10/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/10/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
26/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Yes l did
26/10/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:00 PM.
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/10/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
26/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
26/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
26/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Tomorrow 5:00pm
26/10/23, 8:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 05:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and document. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
27/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 106 4898: So which means we can continue without the A level results and  once they are out the Edoofa will re_ evaluate my application
27/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
27/10/23, 4:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 106 4898: I agree
27/10/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
27/10/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/10/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Noted
27/10/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of interest in August 2024 itself.
27/10/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Noted
27/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Clear
27/10/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
27/10/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/10/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 106 4898: No queries for now ...we are clear
27/10/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/10/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
27/10/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
27/10/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night @263781064898
27/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Night
28/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 106 4898: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is  Ms  Jasmine and she has scheduled my session for 28/10/2023

08/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 106 4898: I discovered that the law systems in Zimbabwe and India are quite different and it will be hard for me to practice law especially Legislative in Zimbabwe without proper knowledge of the system ...
08/11/23, 12:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781064898, it's wonderful that you're actively researching the legal systems in Zimbabwe and India as you plan your future career in BA LLB.
 
However, I would like to offer you some encouraging insights about pursuing your dream education in India through Edoofa. Many Edoofians have chosen this path, enrolling in the BA LLB program, and have gone on to establish themselves in their legal careers. So, don't be discouraged by the differences in legal systems.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Noted
17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 6:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Per semester tuition fee $900.  Standard Duration 5 years admission fee $300.  Registration Fee $750
17/11/23, 7:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Yes
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.

17/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 226 9791: From our understanding the 50 % scholarship they said we are going to be offered accommodation and we will only look for stationery and tuition fee
17/11/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263772269791 Let me help you understand that according to your offer letter you have been offered 50% scholarship on your tuition fees. Moving forward with the session your doubts will be assisted, I hope you understand. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Ok
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 226 9791: It does
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Clear
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 226 9791: We are
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Yes
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Please l as a mother want to understand why are the deadlines needed now because as far as the offer letter explains the program will start in November 2024
17/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Please I want to understand
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 226 9791: I really want to but the program David is talking he will be joining in November 2024 because l need time to gather up resources because  as l once told you we are pensioners so we need time to gather up the money
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Currently l am gathering money to finish David’s school fees so that he may be given results once they are published because l am supposed to finish his school fees in January 2024
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 226 9791: To be given his results in January
18/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and David,

Please excuse my inability to continue our discussion yesterday, I had to attend to an urgent call. By the time I became available, it was quite late on our end, and unfortunately, we couldn't reconnect. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared.
18/11/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To address the same, I would like to seek some clarity from your end. As per to the Indian Education System, every year, the academic intake typically commences in August or September. and as per David's scholarship application, it has been processed for the same intake. 

Hence, I am a bit confused because you mentioned the program will start in November 2024, whereas the letter indicates a scheduled start in September 2024.

Could you please provide clarification on this for me? This will help me better understand your messages better, and then I can address the query you shared more effectively.
18/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Good evening, my concern is I have to clear my fees obligations of his school inoder for him to be able to be given his A level results once they are out. As I have said before David is orphan I am trying and willing to help as long as I am able. My problem is that I might not be able to meet the dead lines.
19/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 226 9791: Good morning, I will try to meet the deadlines though tough but I will try my best.
20/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and David,

Please excuse my inability to continue our discussion on Saturday, I had to attend to an urgent call. By the time I became available, it was quite late on our end, and unfortunately, we couldn't reconnect. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared. 

On this note, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Yes please we can continue we are together with David.
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263772269791, Before we start our session, Could you please let me know if you have any concern?
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 226 9791: No
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263772269791, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 226 9791: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 226 9791: We do stay in Harare
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 226 9791: What about sending to the account on offer letter ?
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Are you going to explain more about the program that David is going to take
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263772269791. I will shed more light on your concern however before that let me share the complete details with you please.
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to my previous message, I believe you had a chance to go through them however we have not received your response. Considering the same, I would like to know if you are facing any challenges, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
25/11/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

27/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Hallo ok you can schedule a discussion
27/11/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David, I hope you are doing well. 

May I please know if you were having any challenges earlier as we haven't received your response this long?
27/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Yes l wanted to know you can postponed the date of paying registration fee
27/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Right now I’m busy gather money to finish David’s school fees
27/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 226 9791: Can you please push the date …as l have noted earlier l really want to pay for David but right now things are tight , the economy is indeed in shambles as l am a pensioner and I’m gathering money for David’s school fees so that he can be given results
27/11/23, 5:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the challenge you are facing, however I would like to emphasize that these deadlines are shared by the university your   that's why it's important to complete the registration process within the given time frame. Hence, May I please know what are your plans in order to raise the funds for the registration fees?
27/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 106 4898: We are definitely gong to sell two of our cows and some farm produce
27/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Please resend the last two messages
27/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing about your plan, With this in mind, May I please know by when you think you will be able to raise the amount for registration process?
27/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 106 4898: End of January
27/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 106 4898: 2024
27/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781064898 As you have mentioned that you will be able to raise the amount by the end of January. I would like you to know that the university does not allow such extension as you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats, the seats would not be available if we delayed the payment for registration. I hope you understand?
27/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok so what will be the date ... if yo can say
27/11/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781064898 Before we that I would like to have a better understanding about your situation, hence could you please let me know about your current financial situation?
27/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Right now Mrs Mujaji s gathering money to finish paying my advanced level so that l can be given results
27/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 106 4898: As far as the offer letter is concerned the deadline of the first installment is tomorrow 28 November and I'm sure Mrs Mujaji is not yet ready due to what l have noted earlier
27/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Please help us on that one
27/11/23, 8:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. I completely understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
27/11/23, 8:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you.
27/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in December last or January next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment since your first deadline stands on 28th November so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
27/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted David to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
27/11/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Yes
27/11/23, 10:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781064898 thank you for sharing your response with us, However I would like to share my available hours are over let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
27/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
28/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 106 4898: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 9:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263781064898 Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you today hence I am scheduling our session for *Tomorrow at 2:00 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
28/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 106 4898: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 11:01 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David, I hope you are doing well. 

With respect to my last message, I am here to continue with our session. Could you please share your response regarding the same?
29/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
29/11/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263781064898, As you have mentioned earlier that Mrs. Mujaji is raising the money in order to pay for your A Level, due to which you have no funds for your registration process at Galgotias University, Could you please confirm is understanding is right?
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 106 4898: It's right
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In this case May I please know what are your plans in order to move ahead with your journey?
29/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Our plan is to pay as soon as we get it
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your point dear, but in order to assist you further it's important to know what date do you have in mind?
29/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 106 4898: We will deposit some money for the first installment any day before 20 December or early
29/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I please know how much amount are you anticipating to pay before 20th of December? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 106 4898: We will pay
29/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Can you please explain more about the offer letter since we are done with the registration.
29/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781064898 I'll be more than happy to explain offer letter to you, however I would like to mention that your registration is not completed dear. In order to make sure you complete your registration, I would like to understand the amount you are expecting to pay before 20th of December so that I can assist you regarding your registration process, I hope you understand?
29/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 106 4898: For now l cannot give you the exact amount but what we assure you is that we will deposit some money in accordance to the first installment.
29/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 106 4898: I understand
29/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, I hope you can understand that in order to share your concern with the officials and request an extension for you, we need this information so that we have a strong appeal for you.
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Ok
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 106 4898: can we continue with explaining the offer letter
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear. Before we start explaining the offer letter for you, May I please know if you have gone through the offer letter?
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Yes we did
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, In order to understand the offer letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	
1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
   4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Tuition fee $900
Course duration 5 years 
Admission and procedure $300
Registration fee $750
29/11/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
29/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 106 4898: Clear
29/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*
