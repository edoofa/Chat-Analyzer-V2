24/11/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Harriet! I hope this message finds you well.

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7238203: Afternoon thanks
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7238203: We can continue sir
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please so that we can proceed?
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Also, in this message, where I have mentioned $250, I wanted to type in $750, i.e. the complete registration fee. I hope this is clear?
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 7238203: Why is it so
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is because of the fact that the grant of $150 is applicable only when you choose to complete the admissio process early and as per the dates provided by the university. However, now that you are planning to do that late in the month of December and as per your preference, in that case the grant won't be applicable on Harriet's admission and you would have to pay the whole $750 fee. I hope this is understood?
24/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 97 7238203: Ok then it's better to pay when results are out it's not making sense now to save I have to take my time
24/11/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask how would it be better to pay after the results are out. Because from what I can see, you are getting significant benefits when you complete the admission now, however, you are not willing to do that. Therefore, may you please help me in understanding the reason behind that?
24/11/23, 4:20 pm - +260 97 7238203: How am I benefiting because am paying 750$ full amount, so no need rush
24/11/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me clarify the situation here for you. When you received the offer letter from Galgotias University, and in the offer letter you had the registration fee of $750 please. They had given you the due dates of 28-Oct-2023 and 28-Nov-2023 in order to make the payment of $600 (with the $150 Grant) in two parts. I hope you are following till here right?
24/11/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 7238203: Ok
24/11/23, 7:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, since we have already crossed the deadline once, you have ideally lost the privilege to make the payment in two parts as well as the Grant, however, since I am here to help you for such a long time, I wanted to make sure that you do not lose on this opportunity.

That is why I was asking that you should pay the first part of the fee in this month so that I can have a discussion with the academic board about that. May I know if you understand this?
24/11/23, 7:17 pm - +260 97 7238203: Ok noted
24/11/23, 7:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since you have got clarity on the same, it would be great if you share your understanding with me here.
24/11/23, 7:20 pm - +260 97 7238203: Can we continue Tomorrow sir am at a party 🥳
25/11/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Harriet!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you were at a party yesterday, how was the party? I hope you enjoyed there?
25/11/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 7238203: Morning
25/11/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here?
25/11/23, 12:00 pm - +260 97 7238203: Yes please sorry was in the garden planting mazie
25/11/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, it would be great if you do this so that we can move ahead.
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Harriet!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: It's been over three days since we last connected regarding your offer letter and the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, however, since I did not get any response from your side I was concerned about the same. 

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
28/11/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 7238203: Morning thanks yes please
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before moving ahead, I would like you to help me by sharing your understanding till here?
28/11/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7238203: Ok my understanding is that if I don't pay 600 dollars by 28th which is today I loss the discount, so I have to pay 750 dollars
28/11/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, that is not right. If you manage to pay half of the registration fee after the grant, which is half of $600, i.e. $300, in that case, you would still be getting the Endowment Plan Benefits. However, if you do that after this month, you would have to pay the whole $750 at once. I believe this is understood?
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - +260 97 7238203: Ok but if I remember correctly you give 14day after half is paid ,I don't want to stress hence I said I will pay all month end December
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - +260 97 7238203: In my country right now business is tough very tough
29/11/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Harriet!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note @260977238203 I would like to mention that I have helped you in understanding the same here multiple times that once the first part of the registration fee is paid, you will again get a period of 30 days in order to pay the second part. 

Now, moving ahead, if you still wish to do the admission process in December, in that case I would have to inform the academic board of the same and they will be revoking your Endowment Plan Benefits removing the Grant as well. May I know if I can move ahead to share the same update with the academic board?
29/11/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7238203: Afternoon I have 300 dollars I can pay even tomorrow than balance month end December send me the dollar account
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7238203: Today am not feeling well sir my BP is high am resting I will make payment tomorrow if I get account thanks
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that, you should keep resting. Now, when it comes to the payment, I believe you made the payment of your enrollment fee earlier through or associate, Penmal Connect's account in Zambia, right?
29/11/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7238203: Yes sir but I changed my phone lost the account number that's why am asking again sorry I will save it now
29/11/23, 1:10 pm - +260 97 7238203: I have found her number let me ask her
29/11/23, 1:26 pm - +260 97 7238203: I have managed to talk to her she said the dollar account is not functional at the moment and I have dollar
29/11/23, 1:26 pm - +260 97 7238203: So I have to change it to kwacha it will be less again
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +260 97 7238203: No response sir
29/11/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for being patient with me here, I was contacting the officials from the team of Penmal Connect to check about the account issue.
