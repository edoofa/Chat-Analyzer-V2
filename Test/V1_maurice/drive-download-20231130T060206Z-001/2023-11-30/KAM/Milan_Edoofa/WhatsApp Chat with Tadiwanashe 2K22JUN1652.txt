I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa.

28/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Absolutely yes

For your queries 1-4 please do not worry as we move ahead with our discussion they shall be covered, and for your last query yes please it is certainly possible to learn and earn credits through the EWYL program to further reduce your cost.
30/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 714 9505: Hello 👋, it's 13 minutes prior our session
30/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 714 9505: Now the session can kickstart
30/09/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the slight delay as there were some network issues, however, we can connect now?
30/09/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 714 9505: I'm going bonkers, enjoying the weekend
30/09/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 714 9505: You can progress
30/09/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
30/09/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 714 9505: Alright bang on!
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 714 9505: Yes ,yes
30/09/23, 10:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 714 9505: Well, that's brilliant
30/09/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
30/09/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
30/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 714 9505: Yes indeed
30/09/23, 10:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 714 9505: Yes yes ,and only a  question on the tuition fees
30/09/23, 10:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, we shall discuss that now.

Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
30/09/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 714 9505: Electricity supply has switched off , and the same happened to the network
30/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 714 9505: In case I secure a 100% , this means it will be only a thousand?
30/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you're experiencing a disruption in electricity supply and network connectivity. Such interruptions can be frustrating, especially when trying to communicate, please do not worry I am here to assist you.
30/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 714 9505: That's awesome 👏
30/09/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand further. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
30/09/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 714 9505: From my understanding, it was written that if a student perfoms exceptionally with 15points and above he will have a 100% scholarship on tuition fees. Now where will this apply
30/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263787149505. I understand that completely however I would encourage you to be patient please as we move ahead all your queries will be covered.
30/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 714 9505: Hope so, let's proceed
30/09/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/09/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/09/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/09/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 714 9505: How much can I budget on these primary expenses
30/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 714 9505: Hello
30/09/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as it was our lunch break. We can connect now.
30/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 714 9505: It's alright let's get to the business
30/09/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, could you please let me know what primary expenses are you referring to?
30/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Registration fee,visa fee and flight expenses
30/09/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hello 👋
30/09/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you understand, the registration fee varies from $500- to $750 which is to be paid by the student/ parent to reserve their university seat, and the average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and for visa the cost of education will be $83. 

I hope we are clear here?
30/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Understandable
30/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 714 9505: How is the scholarship percentage determined then if the A" level results are yet to be published
30/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please your query shall be answered as we move ahead, please be patient.
30/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 714 9505: So let's proceed
30/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 714 9505: The clarification os useful for the sponsor
30/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hope will be answered before we move to the next stages of our admission process
30/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 714 9505: The offer letter is the one that will contain the information on how much is the tuition fees, accomodations and food expenses right
30/09/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.  With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/09/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/09/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/09/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we can proceed
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tadiwanashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I can see here it is stated that upon evaluation, the scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and all this is done without A" level certificate.

Here's my question: If  the results come exceptionally with 15 points and above, will the scholarship percentage be altered
30/09/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263787149505 as I mentioned above, please be patient as we move ahead each query of yours will be cleared Please.
30/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Let them be cleared before we receive the offer letter
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.

2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 714 9505: The question still remains
30/09/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263787149505 there are seven points to discuss in detail, I would require you to be patient please, as I do not want to rush the process and just answer your queries please, I want you to understand the process too.

So please can we move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we can
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now moving ahead.

3. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 714 9505: That's awesome
30/09/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/09/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I'm getting you
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I'm sure using the statement of entry, o level results, statement of purpose and responses to academic interview questions
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
30/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Clearer now
30/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes and if they ace ,reevaluation of the application will occur
30/09/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes @263787149505 as I mentioned in the above point the applications do get revaluated. I belive you might have overlooked the point mistakenly which was stated above.
30/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Not of that ilk
30/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 714 9505: But I think this is where my querie has been solved
30/09/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As I mentioned you should be patient as with the discussions your query will be resolved. 

Now let us move ahead. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we're going along
30/09/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/09/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes
30/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Ckear
30/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Understood
30/09/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Let's proceed
30/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I may be,but I need to consult my parents
30/09/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 714 9505: What a great conversation was it , thank you meet again in the next session
04/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!

04/10/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!

Regarding the cost of your education at Galgotias University, stay assured that we will discuss that during our conversation further. For now, may I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
04/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hello 👋 Sir . Sorry for inconvenience
04/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Currently my parents are not reachable, they have travelled far away so I did
04/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, shall we now move ahead to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University in detail now?
04/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes Sir
04/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
04/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 714 9505: 1. $900
2. 3 years
3. $300
4. $750
04/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
04/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Well understandable
04/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
04/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
04/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.

04/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 714 9505: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I am unable to understand what you are trying to say. Can you please type in your query and let me know fo that same dear.
04/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 714 9505: So if it's 2000+1800 ,thr the total cost becomes $ 3 800 per year
05/10/23, 6:25 am - +263 78 714 9505: Hello 👋 Mr Milan and others. I'm sorry that I came inactive for the session yesterday because of a connection problems can we resume
05/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Good day
05/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hello again
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is completely right! Now, in order to discuss more on that, shall we move ahead with our conversation here?
05/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we can
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we do that, I believe you are clear till here right?
05/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes I am
06/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 714 9505: Good day
06/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hello 👋
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here Tadiwanashe?
06/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we are together
06/10/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
06/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Year it's clear
06/10/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
06/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yeah clear
06/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
06/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 18th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 18th November 2023.*
06/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *18th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yeah we are together
06/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare? <This message was edited>
06/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 714 9505: No ,in Mhangura

I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/10/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/10/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

12/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
12/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Haa no Mr Rajan is best
13/10/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
15/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Hi 👋
15/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!

19/10/23, 9:58 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, as per the discussion that we had here earlier, I believe you recall that the deadline date for making the payment of your registration fee was of 18th October 2023 please, on that note, can you please let me know if you were able to make the payment or not?
19/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 714 9505: Yes we can, apologies for inconvenience
19/10/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, can you please also let me know if you were able to make the payment of the registration fee or not?
19/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 714 9505: Not yet
19/10/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding by when are you planning to do that since we are already past the due date and the university will revoke the offer letter soon? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 714 9505: What then if they revoke
19/10/23, 12:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case Tadiwanashe, If the university revokes the offer letter due to the missed payment of the registration fee, it may result in the loss of the admission opportunity. And I am sure that you do not want that to happen, right?
19/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes I do but I don't have any choice
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that Tadiwanashe?
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Currently we are not in a position to raise that $600 due to some personal reasons, it have been a struggle since I got ill about mid April this year
19/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I understand that, however, in that case, I believe you are aware that you do not have to pay the whole registration fee at once, right?
19/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes but uh
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, you can say what you want to say here comfortably, you do not have to think so much about that.
19/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yeah I understand but..
19/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, can you please also let me know what was it that you wanted to say here dear?
19/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Never mind what's up next
19/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, by when do you think you would be able to raise the registration fee?
19/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Let me consult my parents but I'm sure as latter as February
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I hope you understand that we are discussing to complete the admission process now, right?
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes I understand
20/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, on that note, can you please also let me know what have your parents mentioned about moving ahead with your admission process dear?
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Somewhere around February
20/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Can Edoofa pay for now and we shall pay back
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I understand where you are coming from dear, however, on that note, I would like to mention that paying a student's registration fee is against our policy therefore, it could not be possible dear.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to the challenge that you are facing as of now and why is it that you are not able to raise the finances in time, since you are not sharing proper updates about the same with me here, how possibly could I help you with that dear?
20/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 714 9505: As I told you earlier that I was sick for months ago, I was treated on credit so the trouble is paying the bill up to May
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
26/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I trust you're well.

02/11/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Tadiwanashe, earlier you had mentioned that due to the illness that you had to suffer with you are now dealing with the bill upto the month of May, is that right?
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 714 9505: You got it correct
02/11/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask when you had the discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti, you were aware of the fact that you had to complete the admission process in the ongoing month, therefore, how were you preparing for that since then, and what were your plans for that?
03/11/23, 5:11 am - +263 78 714 9505: Yeah we were aware but no one was aware that it has to be paid in the same month
03/11/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to understand the specific requirements and deadlines for the admission process. If there was any misunderstanding or lack of clarity regarding the payment deadline, it's something we can address.

However, on that note, since we have already passed the deadline date and have moved into this new month, can you please help me in understanding about your financial position and how are you planning to raise the finances for completing the admission process so that we can work on plan according to that.
03/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 714 9505: In the month of massive project incomes that is May. Absolutely all expenses can be sought out but I still have a question from the offer letter
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Good how are you doing?
We can continue then
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
06/11/23, 11:36 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Oh great!
07/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 714 9505: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 5:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes
07/11/23, 5:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, you had mentioned that you have a question about the offer letter. Now, on that note, can you please let me know what was that?
07/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 714 9505: You say that Edoofa scholarship program reduces the college expenses to a range of $2 000 to $3 000 but how mine is up to $3 800
07/11/23, 6:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that query with me here. On that note, can you please let me know how is it that you have calculated the expenses to be $3800 please?
07/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Ok $900 of tuition per semester,$100 exam fee per semester plus $2000 of accomodations so it's $4000
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you are a bit confused please. Now, let me help you in understanding the expenses better. First of all, let us consider about the tuition fee as well as the exam fee. 

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Exam Fee: $200 per annum

Total: $2000 per annum. I hope you are clear till here, right?
07/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes
07/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excellent, now, regarding on-campus accommodation, it's indeed quoted at $2000. However, this might seem more expensive for many students, leading them to opt for off-campus housing.

The off-campus housing cost, including food, is approximately $800, significantly lower than on-campus housing. Hence, the total annual expenses can be estimated at $2800. This would cover tuition, exam fees, and off-campus living costs. Is this clear?
07/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Who can help me with off campus accomodation
07/11/23, 7:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that for the students who are inclined towards off-campus accommodation, we as a team will also assist you with the contact details of the students and people who will assist you in finding the right accommodation fit for you. 

I hope this brings you some relief and we are on the same page?
07/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yeah well understandable
07/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Can we just start it now
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask, what is it that you wish to start now dear?
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I don't need any disturbances
07/11/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I want to know about what is it that you wish to start dear?
07/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Looking for off-campus accomodation
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, that is important for later stage when you will arrive here in India. Before that, can you please help me in understanding about how is it that you are planning to complete the admission process?
07/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Pardon?
07/11/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I want you to understand that finding accommodation is a thing for a later stage when you are coming to India. For now, we would have to focus on completing the registration process dear. I hope you understand?
07/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I got it
08/11/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have understood the same. On that note, can you please also let me know by when do you think you and your parents would be able to plan the payment of the registration fee and complete your admission?
09/11/23, 4:15 am - +263 78 714 9505: As mentioned earlier around May
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

14/11/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for being patient here dear. Now, as I had earlier, mentioned the team was not available due to Diwali Celebrations. Moving ahead, when it comes to the discussion that we were having here about your admission process, you had mentioned that your parents are planning to do that by the month of May, is that so?
14/11/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Yes Sir
15/11/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 714 9505: He'll, how are you doing today

15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are doing well dear. How are you doing today?
15/11/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 714 9505: Good, the network here is stable around the off-peak
17/11/23, 6:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
21/11/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 714 9505: Hello can you resend the offer letter
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/11/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you for the past few days, because I was a bit under the weather and was not working since then. 

Now, that I am well and in a position to resume my work, I have returned here to help you ahead.
27/11/23, 9:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, let me reshare the offer letter with you here for your convenience.
27/11/23, 9:06 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: With that, may I know if we can resume with our discussion regarding the next steps in your admission journey?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 714 9505: I am also apologetic for being less available, may we resume
28/11/23, 9:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Now, before we move ahead, I would like to share an important update with you here. As you are aware that a significant amount of time has passed since you have received the offer letter from Galgotias University, and as you were not able to complete the admission process in time, the university officials are now deciding to revoke your offer letter and cancel the offered scholarship. 

Moving ahead, if you want to complete the admission process later on, in that case, you would be losing on the Early Decision Benefits that you had earlier received as well as the $150 Grant won't be available too. Now, I would like you to share an update with me on how exactly do you wish to move ahead so that I can share the same update with the university officials. Hence, may you please let me know when can we discuss that?
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 714 9505: As I mentioned earlier, May
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here Tadiwanashe. Now, even after I have helped you in understanding the loss that you will incur if you choose to do your admission in May. Therefore, if you still want to do the same, shall I go ahead and inform the university officials as well as the academic board that you wish to do your admission in the coming year, and hence we should shift your name from Early Decision Benefits so that you won't be getting them later on?
