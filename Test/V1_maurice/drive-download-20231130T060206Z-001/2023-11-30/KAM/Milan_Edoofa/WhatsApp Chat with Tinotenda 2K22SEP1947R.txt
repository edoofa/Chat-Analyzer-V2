21/08/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa was added
09/09/23, 8:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tinotenda,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
09/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 893 9736: Everything is has been great thank you
18/09/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/09/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/09/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes
18/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/09/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay I understand
18/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I have reviewed them
18/09/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/09/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
18/09/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I am following
18/09/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes it does
18/09/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I am following
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/09/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay
18/09/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 893 9736: So the payment would not be part of my EWYL grant
18/09/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your inquiry about the EWYL grant. I'd like to clarify that the EWYL grant is specifically applicable to reduce your tuition fees; and it doesn't apply in this context. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay thank you for helping me understand that
18/09/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are clear so that we could proceed with the session.
18/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes we can proceed
18/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 893 9736: No l am not aware please help me with that
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l understand
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes
18/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
18/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Thank you same to you
19/09/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Hie
19/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l am ready
19/09/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 893 9736: That's nice
19/09/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now let us continue after the part that we have left off.
19/09/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, may I know if you agree with this?
19/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l do
19/09/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/09/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l understand
19/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
19/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l am following
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Tinotenda.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Good afternoon how are you l am not ready for the session
20/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?
20/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes my network is tripping
20/09/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, please let me know when you are comfortable to proceed with the session.
20/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 893 9736: We can proceed
20/09/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay
20/09/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 893 9736: At the moment I don't have any questions
20/09/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to what that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
20/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l am looking forward to all of that
20/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Sorry I think you got my name wrong it's Tinotenda
20/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay thank you
20/09/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the error I have corrected the same. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
20/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay thank you
20/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Have a great day as well
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Good afternoon
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Good afternoon everyone how are you feeling today
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes we went through the offer letter and we are available to discuss the same detail
27/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I would like to help me with a few questions
27/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, which ones?
27/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I would like to know if I receive only one offer letter
27/09/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Tinotenda, regarding this query of yours, I have taken a note of the same and stay assured that we will discuss about this moving ahead during our discussion. For now, may you please answer these questions here so that we can move ahead with our discussion please.
27/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 893 9736: 1.$900
2.3years
3. $300
4.$750
27/09/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I understand that
27/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I would like to know what you mean by admission and procedure fee
27/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly, Tinotenda. The Admission and Procedure Fee, also known as a one-time payable fee, is a fee that covers the administrative and processing costs associated with your admission to the university. This fee is typically paid when you accept the admission offer and confirm your enrollment in the program.

In your offer letter, it's mentioned as $300. This fee is not a recurring expense like tuition; it's a one-time payment to secure your place at the university and complete the necessary admission procedures. I hope this is clear right?
27/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 893 9736: So is it part of the registration fee
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are coming to discuss that Tinotenda. Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay I understand
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I am following
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I understand that
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 893 9736: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 893 9736: So the registration fee and admission and processing fee are 2 different things
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I am following
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
27/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Can I please have Mr Charles Jerera contact details as well
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here I have shared the same please. Have you taken a note of the same?
27/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I did
27/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: How do I get in touch with him
27/09/23, 4:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know the reason that you wish to get in touch with him please?
27/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 893 9736: So that everytime I make a payment l send a picture of proof
27/09/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you have to share the proof of payment with us here please, not with Mr. Charles, we will confirm the payment for you.
27/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay
27/09/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
27/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 893 9736: So l asked earlier if l receive an offer letter from one university or?
27/09/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 893 9736: I understand that , l had 2 universities in mind that is Lovely Professional University and Amity university
28/09/23, 6:07 am - +263 77 521 7510: Morning it's Tinotenda, today i will be not able to have session,I'm attending a seminar
28/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, moving ahead, @263788939736 may I know if you are available to have a discussion with me here?
29/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 893 9736: Morning today l will be available for the discussion
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, shall we proceed with our discussion here now?
29/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 893 9736: Yes please
29/09/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
29/09/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I understand that it's the university 's decision
29/09/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
29/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 893 9736: Yes l understand
29/09/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
29/09/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 893 9736: No l am not aware of that
29/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
29/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
29/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 893 9736: Yes I understand
29/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, may I know if you are clear with the query that you had regarding multiple offer letters please?
29/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 893 9736: Yes thank you l understand now
29/09/23, 10:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
29/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 893 9736: No at the moment I don't have any questions
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

29/09/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay thank you for that

03/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 893 9736: Okay so we had a conversation and they have decided that l will wait to receive another offer letter and if l find a university that l am interested in then we will make payments
03/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, are you willing to let go of the offer that you have received from the side of Galgotias University even when you can utilize the transfer option please?

In that case, I believe Mr. Shivjeet had a discussion with you regarding the admission process earlier, and you had mentioned at that time that you are well prepared to complete the admission process, hence, if I may ask what happened due to which you are not able to complete the admission process in a timely manner?

06/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 521 7510: Hie how are you Mr Singh , l would like to know if we are now being to forced to pay because if we are to pay and she doesn't receive any offers letter apart from that of the Galgotias university it means she didn't have the to choose like what we have been told before that you get a chance to choose a university of your choice after you receive offer letter ,it means she is now being forced to a university she is not interested in

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

24/11/23, 7:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. May I know her full name as well dear? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 73 714 9148: Panashe Maruta
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. I had searched for the student in our records, and I do not happen to find her. May you please share her correct full name here with me Tinotenda.
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 73 714 9148: Sorry she is not an Edoofian she got the scholarship through the Chilstar program
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for confirming. On that note, I would first like to mention that we have already shared your application with LPU, and we are expecting a response from their side. In the meanwhile, may I know if you are aware how the admission process of a student is carried out?
25/11/23, 6:51 am - +263 73 714 9148: Yes l think l am aware
25/11/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. May you please help me in understanding how the admission process fo a student is carried out?
25/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 73 714 9148: Morning how are you l am well thank you
25/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 73 714 9148: I think first a student is to receive an offer letter,they pay the registration amount and after that his or her visa is prepared
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. However, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out:

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
25/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 73 714 9148: I understand
25/11/23, 12:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
25/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 73 714 9148: Yes I am aware of it
28/11/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are aware of the transfer option. Now, can you please help me in getting a clarity on your understanding of the transfer option?
28/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 73 714 9148: Morning how are you
28/11/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please, thank you for asking. Now, may you please do this as well?
29/11/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your admission process. 

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here now so that we can transition to the next steps in the admission journey?
