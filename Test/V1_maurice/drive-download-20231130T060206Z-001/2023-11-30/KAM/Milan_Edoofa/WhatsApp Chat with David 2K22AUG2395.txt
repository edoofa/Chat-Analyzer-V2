I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa.

We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
03/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
03/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
03/10/23, 6:53 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Ok noted thanks
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
03/10/23, 9:58 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes please,  it's clear
03/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
03/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
03/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/10/23, 10:07 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes, it does sir and thanks for the explanation
04/10/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and David. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
04/10/23, 2:38 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Yes I am available
04/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
04/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/10/23, 4:51 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Thanks for the explanation,  in the seat reservation it is indicated registration fee is between $500-$750, is it the same explanation?
04/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is the same registration fees that we have discussed before.
04/10/23, 6:16 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Otherwise the two are talking about the same thing, just wanted to have a clarification, thanks
04/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. If you are clear now, shall we move ahead with the session?
04/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
04/10/23, 7:06 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Thanks for taking your to discuss such important issues pertaining to David's education career. Blessed night to you.
07/10/23, 11:40 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

To accommodate our conversation, I propose we meet at 3:00 PM on Monday. I hope this timing works well for you.

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
07/10/23, 9:29 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Thanks for the latest update today.  We know that you cover a wide range of students from all over the world.  Next time maybe we can re-look at the registration process.  Thanks once again for connecting today.

09/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

You're most welcome! I appreciate your understanding and your proactive approach to improving the registration process. We're constantly striving to enhance our services to best suit the needs of our diverse student community.
09/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:20 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Good afternoon Shivjeet
09/10/23, 3:20 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Am available
09/10/23, 3:21 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Though am having problems with the network here , so it will like online, offline. My apologies
09/10/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright thank you for letting me know. With regards to our previous conversation, may I know if you are clear and currently on the same page to further proceed with the session?

09/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected @265998936473
09/10/23, 7:50 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening local time here, yes we are connected and glad to engage in this education matter.  I am happy that my wife was on it immediately and contributed,  thanks Mercy. I support what she has said. Looking forward,  good evening again.

19/10/23, 11:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 11:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorro and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

It was established in 2011 and offers a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate programs in fields like engineering, management, law, and more. The university is known for its excellent facilities and infrastructure, and it has been ranked as one of the top universities in India. 🇮🇳
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and david!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
26/10/23, 5:43 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening,  we will take the first payment plan as try to meet the deadline in the context forex shortages. thanks
30/10/23, 6:32 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening from this end, I hope you are fine.  My sincere apologies for not responding in time, not even sure whether you got message on Saturday after my wife had promised a reply.  I am heartily sorry for this.  Tonight or tomorrow morning we will update you on the suggestion while respecting your timelines. Stay blessed.
30/10/23, 7:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 8:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely appreciate your communication and your assurance to provide an update about the situation however, I also want to emphasize on the missed deadline for the registration payment.

The deadline of October 28th for the registration payment at Galgotias University for David's admission has been missed. Although the deadline has passed, I'm still eager and committed to assisting you in finding solutions and determining the best course of action to navigate this situation effectively. Now, on that note, by when can I expect an update from your end so that we can discuss the same?
31/10/23, 5:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 5:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to revert to me here in the group earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion further. May I know if you were able to go through this message of mine, so that we can discuss the same and plan the next steps about your admission process?
31/10/23, 6:00 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Oh yes I did
31/10/23, 7:10 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening sir, surely I was expected to revert to you on the issue.  Actually I have been thinking about it since we  last talked yesterday.  Your question was very clear to me but I have been liaising with the banks (National Bank) to get the exact figure for the first $300 in terms of rates. In general government is subsidising the exchange rate which is lower but when one sends money outside the banks use the .market rate which is much higher.
As a way forward I am thinking that by 4th or 6th November we should reach an agreement. So if you allow us this week to check, I would be very grateful. I know that we have violated the deadline. Sorry about that. Please have a blessed evening.
01/11/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 9:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts in checking with the banks and the government's exchange rate subsidies. It's perfectly understandable that you're seeking the best financial arrangement for the first payment. I also understand the importance of securing the registration fee to ensure David's admission.

As for the deadline, I'm glad you are aware of the situation, and your willingness to finalize the details by the 4th or 6th of November is duly noted. Now, on that note, I am sure that you would be able to give me an update by 06th November, right?
01/11/23, 10:14 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Yes for sure. By this date everything will finalise hopefully. Thank you so much for understanding . Good night. See you tomorrow
01/11/23, 10:19 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good  night indeed
01/11/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Have a blessed evening ahead.
06/11/23, 4:09 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good afternoon Milan, I remember my commitment.
06/11/23, 11:37 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello again Milan, I would like to assure you that before today goes, the Old Mutual in Lilongwe,  Malawi will update you on payment. I have been working on the transaction even over the weekend (Saturday), always appreciating your support to get things done.  Looking.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
07/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening,  I hope that you are doing fine. Yes, .maybe we can schedule abit earlier,  because it is 
20:20 pm, what time is it there? Yes we can connect as scheduled. Have a wonderful night.
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can proceed with our conversation now please?
07/11/23, 11:22 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello Milan, are you there?
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the conversation that we had here earlier, you had mentioned that you are looking to make the payment of David's admission fee by today, hence, can you please share an update with me here about the same as well?
09/11/23, 7:42 am - +265 993 58 12 14: Good evening Milan, I was with the Old Mutual,  I saw some of the transactions related to the  payment of the admission letter for Davis.  Surely, we are getting very close to it sir. I am not happy with delay though.  I had communicated based on their instructions.  Thanks so much for understanding.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Davi!

The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

17/11/23, 10:00 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello Milan, how are you doing today? I know we owe you a lot. When we thought  it was done, the government devalued the local currency by 44%. So we  need to add more to the kwachas to arrive at the correct figures . Please stayed tuned.
17/11/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. On that note, I would like to ask how were your preparations for the registration fee so far?
17/11/23, 10:34 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Thanks Milan, we are very serious with the registration process  we will get there sooner.  Only that there have been things beyond our control. Sorry about this but we are constantly dealing with the bank.
17/11/23, 10:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that. Now, in order for me to be able to help you better in that situation, can you please let me know how much amount were you able to raise till now for that?
17/11/23, 10:46 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Ok let's check tomorrow so that I can have a chance to check the exchange rate, otherwise it would be difficult for you to grasp. Thanks
17/11/23, 10:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine please, you can tell me the amount in Malawian Kwachas as well.
19/11/23, 1:08 am - +265 993 58 12 14: The amount is MK510,000, thank you sir.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 9:58 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes we are there?
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for responding, however, since it took a bit of time to respond, my working hours are now coming to an end. Let's continue our discussion here tomorrow at 01:00 PM to delve deeper into the admission process and explore the options available at Lovely Professional University for your chosen field of study. Does that timing work for you?
23/11/23, 11:20 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Ok thanks for the conversation   yes we can proceed tomorrow
24/11/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David! I hope this message finds you well.

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 3:35 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes please,  was on the road, sorry.
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Moving ahead, earlier when we had a discussion, you had mentioned that you currently have 510000 MK that you can pay towards David's registration fee, right?
24/11/23, 5:25 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes, this is because the Kwacha has gone down,hence the balance
24/11/23, 7:07 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello
24/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please I understand that. Now, as per the current exchange rate, I believe you have raised a total of $300, right?
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding David's admission process. 

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here now so that we can transition to the next steps in the admission journey?
25/11/23, 10:54 am - +265 993 58 12 14: Good morning I was banking on this information,  I thought you would suggest the way forward,  thanks, but we can proceed
25/11/23, 10:54 am - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes, we can connect now.
25/11/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, on that note, I believe what I said here is true, right?
25/11/23, 12:35 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Yes, it is sir.
25/11/23, 12:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if you have managed to raise $300, in that case, you can move ahead to make the payment of the first part of the registration fee so that we can atleast secure David's seat at the university. I hope you understand?
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: But as you it is another university? Yes we can make payment on Monday.
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get the first question here. May you please come again.
25/11/23, 2:43 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello again, I was asking whether we are still processing the admission letter with the Galgotias University or Lovely Professional University?
25/11/23, 3:51 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good afternoon.
26/11/23, 12:02 am - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello sir

28/11/23, 8:33 am - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delayed response. I was unexpectedly caught up in urgent work that required my immediate attention. I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and I take full responsibility for it.

Regarding the registration fee payment, I understand that you have raised $300, which is sufficient to proceed with the first installment for Galgotias University. Please go ahead and make the payment at your earliest convenience. Once the payment is completed, I will initiate discussions with the Galgotias University officials to finalize David's admission and on the basis of that, I will be updating you as well. I hope you understand that?

28/11/23, 12:41 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Hello Milan, I would have managed to make payment today but the bank is asking for an invoice from you (+university) to make transactions otherwise I would have made the payment by now. I tried to insist they still wanted the invoice. From there,  I went to one of our main bureaux in Lilongwe,  they said they don't send money to companies for fear of making mistakes and it is difficult  to retrieve the money sent to a wrong recipient. From morning to now in the bank but they stl insisted. All the  best. Good day
28/11/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, let me get the invoice generated for you, and once it is done, I will get back to you please. 

Before that, may I know how much amount are you planning to pay and by when?
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - +265 993 58 12 14: Good afternoon,  I will send you $300 as agreed to be first instalment this week depending on the invoice. Thanks for reconnecting us to Galgotias University. Have a great day.
29/11/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 9:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Now, on that note, let me get the invoice arranged for you so that you can make the payment. Along with that, I will also like to mention that the university will be closing the current round of applications by tomorrow, hence, the payment has to be made by then as well.
29/11/23, 9:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, for me to be able to get the invoice generated for you, please share the following details with me here:
