For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Ready
04/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Done
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Yes they are clear.
04/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/09/23, 12:01 am - +263 71 946 4132: Following
05/09/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charlene.  I hope you are well and blessed.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?

05/09/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/09/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Clear
05/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
05/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Is it possible to pay it half half
05/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Does it have a deadline
05/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. Let me help you with the queries here. For the payment of the registration fees you have the option to pay them in installments and indeed it has a deadline and further details will be discussed with you in our future session soon.

05/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 517 8501: Yes lm ready

07/09/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you the previous day?
07/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Yes i managed
07/09/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
07/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 946 4132: In a nutshell Edoofa  offers best and afordable scolarships and produces quality Edoofians as to fullfill its vision .It has many schools ,collages and universities on its platform which they have a long term journey with them.I now  understand that students must have a statement of purposse first towards securing a good scolarship.
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
07/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 946 4132: True thank you so much.
07/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Yes we are
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

Medical laboratory science is a branch that deals with all the clinical laboratory investigations on clinical samples for laboratory diagnosis of various diseases.Blood ,tissue , and body fluid are analysed and examined for various types of foreign organisms and abnormalities.This information is then used by the medical team to make decisions regarding a patient's medical care.Medical decisions are based on the results of clinical laboratory investigation reports.lt is in the field of medicine where it plays a pivotal role by making proper diagnosis possible.Medical laboratory scientists work in clinical laboratories, hospitals,non clinical industrial labs or biological labs.
The field involves collection and receiving of specimen for various biochemical,pathological,microbiological and blood bank investigations.Personnels perform and validate various investigations for the purpose of differential diagnosis.They prepare specimen for examination,count cells and look for abnormalities in body fluids using automated equipment and computerised instruments for performing tests simultaneously,as well as microscopes  and other sophisticated laboratory equipment.The results are analysed and relayed to physicians.

The importance of good laboratory practice can be defined by safety,ethics and management.For a successful lab operation staff and visitors must be safe.Good laboratory practice prevents isolated implications outside the four wall of thr facility,such as cross-contamination ,chemical leaks and infection.
08/09/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 517 8501: 4. Sterilisation is essential to keeping lab equipment,materials and samples clean and functional.Methods of sterilisation include werheat ,dry heat,filtration,chemicals and radiation.Wetheat is the most popular method .It uses pressumed steam to heat the item that requires sterilisation.It is an effective procedure which effectively kill all microbes,spores and viruses.However ,for some specimen biosafety levels,higher steam temperatures or longer incubators are mecessary.The other name for wetheat method is autoclave .Steam generated from autoclaves contain seven times more heat than water at the same temperature.Additionally,when it contacts the material,it instantly delivers heat and can even penetrate a more dense,thick surface.Wetheat's speed and efficiency at sterilisation makes it the most popular choice.Since these are vital to lab's daily operations ,it is important to service and repair your autoclaves regularly.
08/09/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 517 8501: 5.Techniques for placing samples under a microscope involve preparing dry mount microscope slides ,wet mount microscope slides or staining sample.

Dry mount slides are used for studying samples that do not require contact with water in order to survive.The slide must be clean and blank .On the slides ,you very carefully place as thin as possible slice of a sample in the centre of the blank slide .It is then coverd with a cover glass.If you wear gloves ,you can gently pin down the cover glass to align the sample.

For wet mount microscope slides ,it is applied when studying samples which can not survive without water ,usually unicellular organisms and tiny animals.One or two drops of water are placed in the centre of the slide using a dropper.The sample is put in water and covered with a cover glass.Make sure that you do not touch the glass directly as fingerprints would impede studying the sample.

Some organisms are difficult to observe under a microscope without additional staining.A drop of lugol's iodine in water can be added beforr placing the sample in it.Solutions of methylene blue or Gram crystal violet can be used.

12/09/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Charlene

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/G7xliN8mE48I2Js6ikcOVq"

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
12/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted  .Thank you sir thank you for the good times we had .
12/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, dear. May I know if you are available to further proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Welcome Sir .Available
12/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Hello admission officer, l have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Aditi.
12/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the name of your mentor. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted
12/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/09/23, 5:08 am - +263 71 946 4132: Correct
13/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Charlene. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Evening Sir.How was your day
13/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It was great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
13/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Ready
13/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ready
13/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thus great
13/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 946 4132: That will be fine
13/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted
13/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 946 4132: I agree
13/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Understood
13/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 946 4132: noted
13/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 946 4132: correct
13/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are on the same page
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
13/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Yes i did
13/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
13/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thus great
13/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted
13/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thank you for that.
13/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process.
13/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
13/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
13/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Very clear.Lets move no queries Sir.
13/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thank you so much
13/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We will be connected .
13/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thank you for the good time.
14/09/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Charlene. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 517 8501: We are fine and you sir
14/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that I am fine too, thank you for asking. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 517 8501: No .lm not certain about it
14/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 517 8501: Sure it does.
14/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 517 8501: This is great!
14/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 517 8501: Sure l would love to know more
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
15/09/23, 1:05 am - +263 78 517 8501: Yes l am
15/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Charlene. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Good evening .We are fine hope you are fine too?
15/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Ready
15/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine too, thank you for asking.I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
15/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 946 4132: i have gone through
15/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
15/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ok
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thus great
15/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 946 4132: yes
15/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
15/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thus great
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 946 4132: very resonate
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 946 4132: understood
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 946 4132: I am not awere, please provide with more information
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 946 4132: understood
15/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ok
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 946 4132: right
15/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 946 4132: I agree
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/09/23, 4:03 am - +263 71 946 4132: ooh thus great
18/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parents and Charlene,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are very fine ,how are you .You are quiet excused.Sorry for late responce.
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I am good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Can we continue at 7.00pm
18/09/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall connect at the said time frame.
18/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Now available
18/09/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let us continue with the steps here.
18/09/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/09/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 946 4132: thus great
18/09/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Clear
18/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ok
18/09/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
18/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
18/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM. Have a great day.
18/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Alright,Thank you so much  for the day.
19/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Greatings to you.Due to poor network challanges i am not able to connect.My apologies.
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. Hence, I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
22/09/23, 4:29 am - +263 71 946 4132: How are you Sir .Noted  with thnks.
22/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are Fine Sir How are you.You are quiet excused.Noted with thanks.
25/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
26/09/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
26/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Good day to you Sir.Sorry for sure i didn't notice it.I am concentrating with EWYL session .Forgiveness sir.Lets go ahead.
26/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 946 4132: I am very well how about you?Thank you for asking.
26/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. I am well too, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Yes i had the opportunity.
26/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 946 4132: It was fantastic.Lets go for Early Decision its wise.
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 946 4132: I am the parent.No queries lets go ahead
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Thank you for the clarification! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.* <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
26/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
26/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Charlene is currently at school preraring for her Final exam.
26/09/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, may I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
26/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are on the Same page
26/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Available
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
26/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
26/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
26/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 946 4132: lets start
26/09/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 30th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 14th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 946 4132: understood
26/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
26/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
26/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, the deadline becomes the 14th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 14th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 14th of November, 2023).
26/09/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 946 4132: nice
26/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
26/09/23, 6:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
26/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted .Thank you so much.
27/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are ready for the session?
27/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 946 4132: How are you Sir .I am ready now
27/09/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Sorry for late responce.
27/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
27/09/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you on Tuesday at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thank you very much Sir.My admission process will begin on  the 30th of November 2023.Lets proceed with the   Early  Decision Benefit.The Deadline will Be on the 14th of January 2024.
27/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Same to you.Thank you so much.
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 946 4132: How are you Sir.Sorry i was a bit occupied.
03/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking. It is alright.  Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until the parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with the admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
04/10/23, 5:08 am - +263 71 946 4132: clear
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are fine how are you doing.
05/10/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 946 4132: lets proceed.Im ready
05/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
05/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *20th October* and *20th November*. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *20th October* and *20th November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Charlene's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
05/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Go ahead

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

16/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ok .Yes i did
16/10/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 946 4132: 1.US900


2.4yrs

3.US300

4.US750
16/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charlene!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Thus great
17/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are doing well.Hope you are well too.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charlene!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 946 4132: We are well.Hope you are fine too
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 946 4132: we are together
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
18/10/23, 9:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
18/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Good
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 23th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 23th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *23th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Harare
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 946 4132: ok thank you
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 946 4132: noted
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 946 4132: You can share
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 946 4132: Noted with thanks
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 946 4132: clear
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 946 4132: For sure
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 946 4132: no queries
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
