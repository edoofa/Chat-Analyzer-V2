30/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Takunda 2K23OCT2459)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
30/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Takunda EWYL23E0860)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring his access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

30/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Our sponsor Mr Sagar  shared with us that if a student performs well in his evaluation, then the average annual fee for him could be somewhere between $2000-$2500, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.This clearly states that a child can end up having 100 percent scholarship .
30/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to know that our program was able to catch your eye and your counselor Mr. Sagar is absolutely correct. Our aim is to provide affordable education and make students employable ready. This cost reduction can be a significant relief for students and their families. Additionally, the opportunity to earn while you learn adds another valuable dimension to the program. It not only makes education more accessible but also provides practical experience and financial support during your studies.

30/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I can understand that Takunda is currently in his exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect his exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, he can enhance his study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit his performance in the upcoming exams.
30/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and his exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
30/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if he is occupied with exams, you as parents on his behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 07th of November, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?

30/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to note that all three of these forms should be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 02:30 PM. This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective?
30/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 280 1613: 01:00 PM tomorrow, we would have finished.

As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
31/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

31/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I have gone through your views.

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in his admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

01/11/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please now before we move ahead I have a news to share with you.

Please schedule my session for the same date so that we can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
01/11/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is __ and he/she has scheduled my session for _(mention the date)*
01/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Noted
01/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. *Now while we wait for Takunda to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks we will move forward to the third step in his admission journey.*
01/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe he wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Pharmacy for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
01/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Yes
01/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps is on hold in his admission journey, we can move towards the third step of his admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
01/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Yes madam we are
01/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Sure
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
01/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Noted mam
01/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Clear
01/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Yes thats true
01/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
01/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
01/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Yes mam
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Noted with thanks
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
01/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Sure
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Yes mam
01/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 + regitration fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
01/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Sure
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
01/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Well noted
01/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
01/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
01/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Noted
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Clear
01/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Much clear
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
01/11/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Nice and smiling faces
01/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Wonderful
01/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I hope you are excited to see Takunda in this picture for next year's batch ?
01/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 280 1613: It shall be a great excitement
01/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Powerful
01/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Sure
01/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Let's discuss them
01/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Takunda, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 280 1613: This is great
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 280 1613: This is good news
01/11/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
01/11/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I like this plan very much
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $435 on or before November 20, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 280 1613: May you check the dates and amounts in the example. I think they are not what you want to explain
01/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error, it is $425 and November 20th. Also please note these are tentative dates for your understanding.
01/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Noted
01/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Noted mam
01/11/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Affordable indeed
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Give more information on that
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 280 1613: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us.
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 280 1613: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the question 1, it is noted with us.
01/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Question 2:
Qualities of a successful pharmacist and qualities that make me a right candidate for pharmacy program.

A successful pharmacist should have some of the following qualities: 
Strong moral character ,someone who should not be easily changed his behavior or mood by the patient situation, should be honesty, faithful to give appropriate medication and counseling. take responsibility for the patient 's pharmacy care, offer customer service skills that make patient feel at ease. possess numerical skills to calculate the correct dosage of drugs in relation to time and age of patient, have problem solving skills, paying attention to detail and understanding fully. observation skills on the patient and documents and medication.
Now qualities like numerical skills, strong moral character, observation skills, paying attention to detail are some of the qualities that make me be a right candidate for pharmacy program.
01/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Question 3
The role of technology in pharmacology.
Technology plays a vatal role in pharmacology by enabling a transition in drug preparation and dispensing. It also allows the medication therapy management by pharmacist to be easy, efficient and accurate. It provides pharmacists with the chance to make patient database. It also promotes the drug discovery process to be fast and efficient. It allows data sharing and collaboration in pharmacology. It enables the online medication therapy management. It allows control and management of drugs in stores, considering the manufacturing and expiring dates. It is time saving, making the patient get help fast.
01/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Question 4
The role of a pharmacist in the success of a healthcare team is very significant. It is the pharmacist who ensures the safe prescribing and dispensing of medication to patients. It's the duty of the pharmacist to do the continuous coordinated medication management and review. The pharmacist will also offer counseling sessions to patients. The pharmacist will recommends safe and effective medication therapy then goes further to monitor the medication therapy on patients. The pharmacist also provides dietary supplement counseling sessions and monitoring.
01/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Question 5
Giving of antibiotics in cases of viral infections by medical practitioners is done for good reasons though antibiotics are not a cure for viral infections. Antibiotics are given to patients with viral infections to counter any secondary bacterial infections to the patient. Antibiotics will get rid of the bacteria that will be around the viral infected area of a patient. 

Now the circumstances under which the antiviral drugs are administered is key to understand before administering the antiviral. The antiviral drugs should be administered within forty-eight hours from the time when viral infection symptoms were noticed. For example in a flu patient, the antiviral drug is administered soon after one is infected by flu illness.
01/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Documents will come soon, we are waiting for the recommendation letter from the school
01/11/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions. That is alright please, in the meantime let us continue with our discussion so may I know if you were able to go through the messages above?
01/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Noted
01/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Still going through
01/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
01/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Now read and noted. Let's continue
01/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 280 1613: True
01/11/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I agree
01/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Clear
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Clear
01/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

01/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thankyou for sharing the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A level?
01/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I am sorry, he don't have this document due to reasons beyond our control. He registered for the examinations late, by the time when others were receiving their statements of entry, that's when it was noticed that he didn't register. Therefore he did a late registration and was allowed to sit for examinations without this document.
01/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 280 1613: You can contact the school administration on the email and phone number shown on the recommendation letter.
01/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Or contact ZIMSEC Midlands office.
01/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please thank you for letting me know that. The letter of recommendation is also fine in that case. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 280 1613: We can connect, but my network is not well so I may  delay responding.
01/11/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts to connect despite network issues, and I completely understand that there may be delays in your responses. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 280 1613: So far the admission process is clear
01/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Takunda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I will be much excited madam
01/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 280 1613: That great

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

Will I still be able to get some offer letters from other universities so that I can choose

28/11/23, 11:58 am - ~ Jonathan Mbakada left
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Thank you madam kirti
I enquired and googled about the university
The offer is good and pleasing, but I found no interest in the university 
I hereby kindly ask if other offer letters are coming, will be glad to wait for them and go through the universities
28/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 489 5439: I love the universities you partner with,
They are indeed great universities especially LPU in jalandhar, would be happy and pleased to be admitted at such topping universities
28/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Please help me out madam, I sincerely need your help
28/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Hello madam please add his father

+263772801613
28/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 395 9454: We were so grateful to  be considered mam Kirti .
28/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 395 9454: How are you mam
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay, there was some network issue on my side, I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add Takunda's father.
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
28/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Thank you so much for clarifying the concern
28/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Thank you mam
28/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Very clear madam
Thank you
28/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 489 5439: No problem I'll wait for other offer letters
I'll try to be patient
28/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
28/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 489 5439: That's good.. But I prefer to wait for offer letters from other universities left and I will evaluate and conclude which one is the best
28/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Am sure its better to be patient for the best
28/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand what you are trying to say here, and it is fine if you do not wish to move ahead with MVN University, however, as per the update we received from the counseling team we were informed that your desire to get a high quantum of scholarship and let me inform you that you were offered a 75% scholarship, however, if you do not wish to move ahead with MVN, we do not have problem with it, but please understand the universities where we have shared your application with will not be offering you such a high quantum of scholarship. 

As per the updates we made sure that you get a high-quantum scholarship and we provided you with the same if that is not a concern we can definitely wait for other responses, however, if you lose this opportunity you may never get that back, please remember.
28/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Am sure its better to be patient mam all will be well
28/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. If you have made up your mind, we respect your decision. However, as your admission officer, I am keen to understand the reasons behind your decision to change the offered university (MVN). If you believe that MVN University is not the right fit and you wish to explore other options, I would appreciate insights into the specific reasons. MVN University was recommended to Takunda after careful evaluation, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, understanding your concerns will help us provide feedback to the university and assist you in making the right decision for your child's education.
28/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's worth noting that we have been working in the education sector for over 14 years, ensuring that all the universities we are associated with maintain a high standard of education for our students. The message you shared seems to question the quality of education and directly counters the recommendation made by the academic board. With that in mind, I would like to understand your perspective more comprehensively to address this matter effectively. Could you please share your thoughts here?
28/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 395 9454: We really want to appreciate your  concern on the issue of turning out the MVN offer .The issue is upon  application the are some universities considered like LPU Parul only to mention but a few
28/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what made you inclined so much towards LPU, please?
28/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 489 5439: I here you madam and since you are my admission officer you truly deserve to know some of my reasons for not getting along with the offer letter from MVN

Yesterday after receiving that offer letter from you I thereafter googled about the university rankings in India
If I am right as per the Google MVN university is not ranked yet by the NIRF in India, that meaning over 50 % chances that it's degrees aren't globally recognized 
It is still a new University established in 2013 
I can say these are some of the reasons amongst others <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for expressing your concerns, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching MVN University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
28/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
28/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, I can understand that you wish to explore the alternatives you mentioned, specifically LPU and Parul University, however, we are associated with LPU university and we have already shared your application with the university and we are expecting responses from them.
28/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now let me help you explain why we are not partners with Parul University. I understand that since you are not physically present here and since you have limited knowledge about the universities here in India, you do believe in the information that you get on the internet. But, since we have been in the Indian Education sector for more than a decade now, we do have strong connections with the education ministry and organizations all over India due to which we know all about the universities here in India.
28/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us first discuss about Parul University. Since you yourself have mentioned its name, I believe you were not aware of the fact that Parul University is not among the institutions listed in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, and due to the same reason any degree completed by the students at Parul University is not recognized. Were you aware of this?
28/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam if I may sincerely ask you which university is the best between LPU and MVN ❓
Thank you for making me feel comfortable asking and replying you
It's nice talking to you
28/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 489 5439: If you are said to be a student and these two offer you admission
Which one would you turn down and why
28/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Thank you so much mam for the close look on the highted Universities am sure Parul was mistakenly mentioned
28/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please @263714895439 I will get back to your question, let me explain why Parul University is not associated with us, please.
28/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, as I have already mentioned Parul University is unranked in NIRF, and the degree is not recognized. Moreover, the founders of Parul University were accused of rape inside the university and I am sure being an outsider, you might not be familiar with it.

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there.
28/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 489 5439: According to world university rankings and times higher education rankings., LPU is in top 1000 in the whole world that making it a good university ahead of a lot of university that include MVN
Hence I'm much interested in LPU very much madam,
And will feel so happy to be admitted there
28/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for Takunda.

I hope you understand now why Parul University is not one of our partnered universities and I am sure you as parents will also not want your child to attend a university that has been accused of rape right?
28/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 489 5439: That's so good of edoofa.. That was a good and right decesion not to patner with such universities
28/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 395 9454: Thank you mam thats true we would not be happy to hear that
28/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yah.. Thank you for enlighting me on that
Won't be happy to attend such a university
That's true madam
28/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your question Takunda. Let me tell you that both universities are very well, and it is true that LPU is the best, however, this event brings us to the concern shared by the counseling team we were informed of your desire to get a high quantum of scholarship. If you do not wish to move ahead with MVN, we do not have a problem with it we appreciate your decision, but please understand the universities where we have shared your application will not be offering you such a high quantum of scholarship. If that is not a concern for you, and the cost is not a problem then we can surely wait for the responses of the other universities, however, if you miss your chance here you will not be able to transfer back to this university since you would already miss your opportunity.
28/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So before jumping on to decisions, I would encourage you to think twice before making any decisions that you might regret in the future, being your admission officer, I would not suggest this, and I think there is no harm in understanding the letter and discussing it, even if you reserve your seat you do have the transfer option available so it is a win-win situation for you, keeping two options handly and finally decide what you wish at the end, so please think about it first before making any decision.
28/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam thank you... Let me think wisely, will come back with feedback
28/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please take you time, and you can update me.
28/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam will wait for the mail from the MVN university and pay the registration fee within the required 15 days to reserve a seat
But if you do receive any offer letters from other remaining universities do share with me immediately so that I can go through them there and there and decide
Thank you so much madam, thank you indeed for your time and helping me out
You are a good officer

29/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, so may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion?
29/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes I'm ready
29/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
29/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
29/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk
29/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you madam. How are you?
29/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
29/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
29/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 489 5439: 1..$1000
2..$0
3..$2250
4..$125
5..$1000
29/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
29/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 489 5439: If you are saying they awarded me a 75% scholarship on tuition then who's going to be Paying the remaining 30% if I don't have to pay any tuition fees through out the course
29/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Can you explain the first paragraph of the letter, I don't understand the 100%
29/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772801613 Thank you for pointing that out, it must be a clerical error the scholarship offered it 75% and I have updated the team to let the university know about the error please do not worry. Now coming back to your concern Takunda. I believe what you are inquiring about is the remaining 25% of the fee. Since you have been awarded a 75% scholarship now when you inquire about the balance, it is to be catered to by the parents and the students who would be pursuing their higher education in India.  I am sure when you had your counseling session with your career counselor they mentioned that the cost of education is around $6000-$8000 but after this scholarship, the cost of education will be $2000-$3000. Over here your cost is within the range of $2000-$3000 along with the 100% waiver on accommodation.
29/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 489 5439: So if I'm getting you right my parents will be paying the remaining 25%
29/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk thank you
29/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 395 9454: If my memory tells me well this range was upon 50 percent scholarship
29/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I think this wants to be 100% in tution and accommodation because the second page and first paragraph is saying so again.
29/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 280 1613: So 100% on tution and accommodation is okay with us as the letter states, and explains.
29/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772801613 as I mentioned that was a printing error by the university and as far as you are talking about the 100% scholarship, could you please provide me with clarity since as per our counseling records you are eligible for a 50-100% scholarship and you have been offered a 75% scholarship by the university, maybe you can help me here?
29/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes we understand that one madam
Thank you for clarification, we seemed to be confused by the two figures
29/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
29/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes I understood madam
29/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 71 489 5439: So how is food served.. Do I buy it daily or

Can you explain for me
29/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you explain. As per the breakup of the fee shared by MVN University, food is not included in the services offered by the university and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this, all the queries that you have been addressed?
29/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk that's great
Thank you
29/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
29/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
29/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk
I'm done
29/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2250, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
29/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Very much clear madam
This is a good program indeed
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
29/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes... Once got the insights of the program before
29/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 489 5439: So if the university offers 75%scholarship
Is it final or it may be altered by Alevel results
29/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Or the A level results alters the course yu have
29/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. If you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
29/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk that's clear
29/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 489 5439: So they don't change my course depending on the results
29/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A student is allowed to change the course, even after they arrive in India, if they are eligible for the same so do not worry about that.
29/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Thank you
29/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
29/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 489 5439: I guess for now I have asked all questions I had
29/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
29/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam thank you
29/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes 
very much clear
29/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
29/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
29/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
29/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yes
You are explaining well madam
It's clear
29/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.
29/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
29/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
29/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
29/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Yeah the offer is exclusive and highly beneficial, that's true
And it's an advantage to me and my parents because they will be left to pay only a small percentage of the tuition
But we as a family, we are more concerned and looking forward to receive the other remaining offer letters so that we compare the universities
We are ready and set to even accept the admission at the best university though with the lowest tuition cut let's say 60%
29/11/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263714895439 I understand, however, as I mentioned yesterday we are just discussing the letter, at the end the choice is yours and we will be sharing other offer letters as well once we get updates from the universities.
29/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Thank very much for the clarifications made above. Now I think we should also consider the internationally credibility of the university. We need to work with an internationally recognized universities.
29/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please do not worry, at the end of our discussions I will be sharing all the university insights with you.
29/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 280 1613: That will be great
29/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam, let's finish the discussion
29/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $2500 - $1,000 = $1500 and This amount can be paid in two installments of $750 and $750, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
29/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Sure, what about the instalments on admission and processing fees? can it be split into two parts?
29/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 11th, 2023*.
29/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
29/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Yes explain
29/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Isn't it that the 15 days count down starts the day the university mails us the letter 🤷‍♂️
29/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, The letter that we have shared is the official letter only, the university was occupied with organizing the freshers of the students and hence they shared the letter with us so that we can share it with you it is the official letter by the university since the university is our partnered university.
29/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *January 11th 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
29/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
29/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 489 5439: But that day you said they are going to mail us,
 isn't?
29/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 489 5439: 👆👆There
29/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Noted
29/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, they will be mailing you the letter, but they were not available to mail it that same day hence they asked us to share the letters with you during the discussions please. Let me help you here with your query regarding the official admission letter - The letter is issued by the university once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk noted
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 280 1613: We are near Bulawayo
29/11/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/11/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/11/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 280 1613: What about the bank transfer
29/11/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/11/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
29/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Yes provide
29/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
