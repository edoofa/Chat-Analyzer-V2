You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
01/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

01/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 5:58 am - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks. Good morning
02/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Trieon.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Ok
02/11/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you were able to go through the benefits above?
02/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772969662 may I know if we are still connected?
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 296 9662: I get access to international  accredited universities in India, l also save money, earn Endowment Grant and registration fee is split into affordable instalments
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Trieon, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
03/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks

04/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Trieon.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
06/11/23, 6:41 am - +263 77 296 9662: How are you
06/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Trieon.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you. Thank you for asking I am doing great. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How are you
06/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Hie is your day
06/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and my day is going great. I hope the same for you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Am busy but you can go ahead
06/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I really appreciate you connecting with us despite you being occupied with work. May I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Yes
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 296 9662: I understand you. Thanks
06/11/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600
06/11/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Yes
06/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Ok
06/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 11:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I had been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to touch base again tomorrow at 1:00 PM. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
16/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Trieon.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier as it was our holidays and I had a good time during the festival. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 296 9662: OK but partly busy at work
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please our discussion is almost over, it will hardly take 10 minutes of your time.
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Ok
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are clear so far?
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 296 9662: It's clear
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Trieon's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing great thank you for asking, may I know if you were able to go through my message from yesterday?
17/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Yes
17/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Very excited
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
27/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Trieon,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Trioen,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 296 9662: We will discuss tomorrow
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges due to which you are not able to connect with us now?
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 296 9662: But are there universities that offer Diploma in Software Engineering
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Am still at work
28/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why do you wish to change his course now all of a sudden?
28/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Was just asking coz at one time Trieon indicated in that course
28/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Interest
28/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible if he is eligible, to the University, however, for now, it will not be possible since Trioen has already received the offer letter and if we ask the university to change the course now, they would get a negative impression that the student is not serious enough for the scholarship, so it is certainly possible after you register yourself with the university and even after the student arrives in India.
28/11/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Trieon.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not response since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
