12/09/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Alson,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Alson’s higher education?
11/10/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Alson.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few months, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263780145427 ?
14/10/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa. In the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.

We acknowledge that you have been able to notice the messages that we share however, I think there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing your absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in 20222, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @263780145427.

28/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?

28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is  B.Sc (Chemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 014 5427: correct
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 014 5427: noted
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes that $200 right
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 014 5427: so am l going to pay for  the rest  when lm in India since l paid the 200 ?
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Please clarify for me
28/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 I believe you are confused right now and what you are referring to is the Edoofa program fee of $350, this $750 is the registration fee, it is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
28/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Clear now so l will also have to finish the edoofa program fee
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 014 5427: right
28/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 yes please that is something your counselor will be able to help you understand better, however, the $750 is the registration fee which will ensure your seat with the university.
28/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay madam noted
28/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now since we will not be available to continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the day time which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
28/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 014 5427: thank you good night
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: l am available now
29/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: good afternoon
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes indeed
29/11/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 014 5427: What about the 750 its not in the total
29/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 014 5427: you said its not an additional fee if lm got right . so is it in the tuition fee of 1800 or ………….?
29/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 014 5427: understood now
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay okay
29/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 014 5427: how much roughly can the visas and flight cost
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy and the visa cost will be $83.
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay thank you
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: wooooow nice
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It was a pleasure to meet them in person, I hope you are excited to be in this picture for next batch?
29/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 014 5427: looking forward to it
29/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me it was my dinner break so I was not able to get back to you. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

29/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes thank you
29/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians.
