19/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Samantha,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Samantha's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon  officer

20/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I'm  sorry I'm not available  now
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand you must be busy, let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am.
21/10/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Samantha,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 440 5506: Let's connect at 12:15 afternoon
21/10/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon  I'm now available
21/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 636 1744: I remember that it was said that I will receive a letter from the founders of edoofa every Wednesday in form of a newsletter.  I don't remember well about the statement of purpose but I do remember that it  was said that after that I will receive a counseling sessions from a mentor on university admissions, I will receive an offer letter from different universities or colleges after that I required to pay for registration in something like five universities and wait for the acceptance letter from the university . And I will use the acceptance letter to apply for a VISA
21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 636 1744: May you please explain again on the statement of purpose
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 636 1744: Thank you  very much 
Understood
21/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Thank you
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Samantha,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems you haven't had a chance to respond, even though I noticed that you've seen my previous message. Could I please inquire if our connection is still connected?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the O- level results, it is noted with us, I am sorry to hear about that, may I know what happened?
27/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I had a very serious chest pain not flue not coughing but my chest was heavy  and blocking  and feeling  very weak even  the doctors couldn't  diagnose  the problem because  it was just complicated but at last they notice that I had  heart problem one of my vessels  is too weak it doesn't  pump  properly
27/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about the serious chest pain you've been experiencing and the complexity of the diagnosis. It must be challenging to deal with such health concerns. It's important to prioritize your health and follow the recommended treatments and advice from your doctor, may I know how do you feel now?
27/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I'm feeling  better
27/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, you are feeling better now. I would now love to continue and move ahead with our discussion however, it is past our available hours, so let us reconnect tomorrow to move ahead with our discussion.
27/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Thank you I will be waiting
27/11/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great night.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon officer yes I am  available
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now with this, we proceed to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes  the information is accurate
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes thank you I understand
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes he did thank you
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Well understood thank you
28/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok so in other words $750  is a once off pay ment
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 440 5506: So this $2800 per annum is it possible  that I break it into 3
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better please. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 440 5506: If you say the second installment  is to be payed in january  next year you mean 2025
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. May I know if you are clear?
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok thank you its very clear now
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I understand  thank you
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Sorry may know what I was doing earlier  was just a training  without  credits
28/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774405506 no please, you can enquire about your credits with your mentor and once you register yourself with the university your EWYL account gets linked with the university account, and all the credits that you have earned so far can be used then.
28/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok thank you I understand
28/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now since we will not be available since our available working hours are now over so we will continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the daytime which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 636 1744: Good day 
Yes we are able
29/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
