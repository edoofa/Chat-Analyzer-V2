I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Along with Mr. Milan (Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Senior Admission Officer), Mr. Jyotishman (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

Before we proceed, I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today?
01/08/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 325 2317: We are good, thank you for asking.
01/08/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Precious she is on vacation school starting tomorrow at school for the next 2 weeks. Its only that she will join us
01/08/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I am glad to hear that. It is a pleasure connecting with you today. Since it's the first time we are connected with each other, may I know your good name or how would you want me to address you?
01/08/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 325 2317: You can call me Draper,
01/08/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I would even like to inform you that this group wants equal participation of Parents if the student is unavailable, and it would be appreciated if you share your reasons for not connecting beforehand if you or the student is not available.

As the admission process discussion is likely to finish within 4 days, so please be attentive so we can carry the process smoothly without any delay. I hope we are clear on this?
01/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Very clear
01/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. First of all, I would like to congratulate you and your family on making the decision to enroll Precious in the Edoofa program.

Our goal here remains the same: *To ensure that every Edoofian is treated with the same respect and care, and now that you've been accepted into the scholarship program, I'd want to walk you through the steps you'll be taking*
01/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, I would like to share that our available hours are from *12.00 pm to 04:00 pm* and our discussions will be held from *07.30 pm to 11.00 pm* so make sure that you are available during our discussion hours so that, our discussion will be carried out within the same duration. I hope you have taken note of our discussion hours?
01/08/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 463 9015: I'm Cynthia
01/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know if you have a taken a note of our discussion hours?
01/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes, but 11pm is a bit late since l have to wake up early around 5am to prepare for work. I am a government employee l start work at 7:45am to 1645 thus Monday to Friday, so at times l might not be  readily available between 12  and 4pm. The other thing is network, its terrible at times, we stay in rural Zimbabwe, l pray we make it without many hustles.
01/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Can our evening discussion go up to 10pm,  it's just a suggestion
01/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I completely understand that, sure if you be available we can always finish our discussions by 10.00 PM.
01/08/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you for your understanding
01/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.  I recently had a conversation with Ms. Harmehak, and she did brief me about Preciou's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
01/08/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 325 2317: We indeed are proud of Precious, our wish is to see her excel in life and be able to stand on her own. From our discussion with Ms Harmehak, the part l loved most was that of the  access of up to 100% scholarship on tuition fee. I know Precious to be someone who stops at nothing at attaining her set goals hence, she will most certainly work hard to attain her dream through earning scholarship credits. The other thing l loved is that by the time she finishes her program she will be well connected to other professional in the field, she will get to network with others. I also appreciate the tuition fees, which are quite affordable and giving her quality education.
02/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you, have a great day to you too!
02/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 463 9015: Thank you
02/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

02/08/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Good evening it's Draper, how are you
02/08/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773252317, thank you for asking, I am doing great. I hope you are well too.
02/08/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I am good
02/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you were able to go through the forms shared and if you have any query related to the forms?
02/08/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes l went through the forms.  On parents details ,  Father's name can l indicate that he is late, meaning that other details such as contact number becomes irrelevant and as of the mother we have no contact since is she left her more than eight years  ago. I then took her into my custody with the help from my other siblings. I am her aunt. On mother's details there should l just write her name
02/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about it. Yes, please in that case, for fathers details you can write N/A for the required details and in place of the mother you may fill your details.
02/08/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay thanks. What about sponsor 's details, l thought that's where l come in
02/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The sponsor is the person who will cater for your higher education, usually, the sponsor is mostly the parent or the guardian of the student
02/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay thank you for the clarification
02/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, may I know if you have any other queries?
02/08/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 325 2317: One other thing, Precious is on vacation school until the 18th of August 2023, since she has to sign on the forms l guess we can wait for her
02/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand, in that case, parents can do that on behalf of the student.
02/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay thank you, will do so tomorrow morning
02/08/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, alright, have a great night and we shall reconnect tomorrow at 12.00 PM.

03/08/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Registration fee was pegged at $350usd ,that what is written on the registration form, maybe l am mixing issues
03/08/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Sorry for coming in late, was busy compling reports
03/08/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $205 you have already paid, and for the registration fee, I would suggest you please refer to the acceptance letter and then let me know if you are clear about the registration fee ?
03/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay
03/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay ... We can start
14/08/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 463 9015: Ok go ahead
14/08/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes .. they are clear
14/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Following
14/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes they are very clear

14/08/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Lets proceed
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

14/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I will be done around 1700 hours
14/08/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Am sorry can we please change the time to1800hours ... The network here is poor
14/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm CAT. I hope you will be available.

14/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier today, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes am available
14/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
14/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes i did go through the videos
14/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
14/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay... S
14/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 325 2317: According to my understanding.. edoofa is there to provide a life transforming education.
14/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 325 2317: And also according to one of these videos ... To be a great edoofian i have to be someone who is able to follow instructions  and also be open minded
14/08/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I also understood that Edoofa is not all about getting me into a good school and all... But they have my future in mind .. they have worked so hard to ensure that as i learn i can also acquire skills so that i can be employable and also am able to express whatever is in my mind practically... The schools also in trying to create better students .. they make us solve problems, learn how to interact with the community
14/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I also understood that... Edoofa ensures that all its students are happy, they have access to good quality educaton through good teachers , they care about our welfare... I also noted in one of the videos that we will get to be part of some of India's cultural events like holi as they mentioned
14/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Also edoofa , before sending us into different schools they work with several organisations to make sure that whichever school they sent us into are of good quality.
14/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/08/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes i did...
14/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you
14/08/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay
14/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Wednesday at 01.00 pm.
14/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

16/08/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 325 2317: This message was deleted

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, yes, I did receive your response, thank you for submitting your SOP form, it is duly noted with us.
16/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 325 2317: For the audio that requires me to put an audio.. am i supposed to say my name , age and things like that
16/08/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you here, for question 1 you need to introduce yourself first and then highlight your personal and professional skills.
16/08/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 325 2317: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, however, question 1 is yet to be answered, so may I know by when will you be able to share the question1, fill out the SOP form and share the academic documnets?
16/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I sent an SOP form with all the details yesterday
16/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 325 2317: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, kindly excuse me for that, we have received your SOP response. I shall wait for your response for the academic documents.
16/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay thank you
16/08/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 325 2317: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 325 2317: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes that's true
16/08/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes we can start
16/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes
16/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes .. well understood
16/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes its clear
16/08/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Following
16/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 325 2317: No queries for now.. everything is clear
16/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have no queries. Alright, now Precious, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay .. thank you
16/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
16/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Same to you
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
17/08/23, 11:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: "Good morning Parents and Precious.

20/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I understand that one has  to register by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750 so as to secure a seat at the University
20/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
20/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 325 2317: No queries, everything is clear and understandable
20/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you very much looking forward to the good news
20/10/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since our available hours are now over, let me share the endowment plan with you, you can review it understand it better, and share your thoughts on the same and we will connect tomorrow at 08:30 am.
20/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

21/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and precious,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 325 2317: Lets connect at 2pm, currently l am not at home
21/10/23, 8:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263773252317 I understand that you must be busy, however, please understand that today is Saturday and our available working hours for today are from 08:30 am to 01:30 pm CAT. So it will not be possible for me to connect at 02:00 pm. Also please note that these delays in the discussion are having a negative impact on Precious scholarship since the academic board is also present with us here. I would encourage you to take 1 hour of your time for discussion today.
21/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 325 2317: True today is a Saturday, thus the day l do my washing and cleaning,having been at work Monday to Friday.  I do value these discussions very much so let me try to avail myself around 12.
21/10/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I shall wait for your response at 12:00 pm. today.
21/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Good afternoon, l read the benefits , l am impressed
21/10/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Precious, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay, that will be great! infact it's a blessing
21/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Everyone would like such an opportunity
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 325 2317: It's quite clear, hence the Endowment program will be very welcome
21/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.

21/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Wow, thank you very much, it's really good to be associated with Edoofa. We as a family are really grateful. Thank you so much. Network is bad this side
23/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Precious,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Precious,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 325 2317: That wii be great,
25/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Right
25/10/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 11:15 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Either way the options are quite good hence very encouraging and it will be entirely up to her to make a decision that best suites her
25/10/23, 11:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 11:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 11:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
25/10/23, 11:30 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Everything is clear. I also had a busy day but thankfully l was able to to take a small break, l am also calling it a day and hope for a pressure free day
26/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Sorry, got a distraction but l am back. Everything is clear
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Crystal clear
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you it's quite clear
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 325 2317: So far so good if l fail to understand something l will get back to you.
26/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Precious's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that precious is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes yes
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
15/11/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Precious ,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *PDM University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship. <This message was edited>

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

15/11/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 5:59 am - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you 🙏 we greatly appreciate the offer. I am   attending my father in law's funeral burial today, so today is out maybe tomorrow from 5:30pm
16/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Precious.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you are happy and have acknowledged the message I am looking forward to connecting with you at 05:30 pm today.
16/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Precious

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond although I noticed that you were able to go through my message. May I know if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Connected
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I would like to thank God for Precious is through with her examinations
17/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Okay we can move on
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Precious will join us tomorrow, her phone has an outdated WhatsApp version
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 325 2317: 1. Tuition fee after scholarship 1315 USD.     2.  3years.     3. registration fee - 750 USD
17/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 325 2317: Yes it does
17/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
18/11/23, 8:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Precious,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 325 2317: Good morning, we are indeed connected and everything is clear
18/11/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
18/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 325 2317: That's great
18/11/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 325 2317: Very clear
18/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Yemurai with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 325 2317: Sure it does
18/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 325 2317: The program is greatly appreciated
18/11/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
18/11/23, 10:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
18/11/23, 10:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
18/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 325 2317: It's understandable and very convenient
18/11/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 30, 2023.
18/11/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
18/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 325 2317: Please explain
18/11/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of November 30, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of December 30, 2023 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 325 2317: It's very clear and manageable
18/11/23, 11:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now that we are clear with the payment plan, we can also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 11:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 325 2317: I reside in Mutare, l have sisters in Harare and in the USA.
18/11/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 325 2317: Thank you, can't this other sister do it form America
18/11/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Innbucks for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 11:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, they can certainly do a direct transfer to the bank details mentioned in the offer letter.
18/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.

23/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 325 2317: So far so good
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDM University's credentials and official recognition by the government of India, you can visit their website by following this link: [PDM University - Recognition & Approval] (https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/).
