31/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Sharmaine 2K23OCT2489)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
31/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Clear
31/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into her academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring her access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
31/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Diploma in Medical Lab Technology that's wat Sharmain Tsiga will be doing and that has impressed me

31/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this form, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
31/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Noted and wen am I supposed to complete and send them
31/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I shall get back to you. I can understand that Sharmaine is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit his performance in the upcoming exams.
31/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
31/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if he is occupied with exams, you as parents on his behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 7th of November, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
31/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we are
31/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your query here. It's important to note that all three of these forms should be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 02:30 PM. This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective?
31/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 295 0153: A we going to have another session tomorrow or day after tomorrow just to add up 1 full day to complete them
31/10/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We are going to have another discussion tomorrow at 02:30 pm CAT.
31/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So the forms should be ready by then
31/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.  I understand that printing forms can be difficult as I mentioned earlier, we need to be proactive to complete the process within 4 days and then only you as a parent will be able to start the EWYL program by the 7th of November. So please I would encourage you to get the forms printed out from a nearby internet cafe by tomorrow by 02:30 pm, if students are not available parents can also fill out and sign the forms on their behalf.
31/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok noted

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes sir
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I have gone through
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 295 0153: This message was deleted
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Very clear
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
02/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Very clear
02/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 295 0153: The massage to see vidios for students to have clarity on being an Edoofian
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
02/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

06/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 295 0153: That's ok we understand
06/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of Sharmaine's university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in Sharmaine's admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we are
06/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of her university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in her admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move her application ahead and help her to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on her application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require her availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with his/her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
06/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in her admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

I hope you are doing well. Could you please recheck your mentor name and session time and then let me know?
11/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

15/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772950153 I will not be available today at 08:00 pm please, so may I know if we can connect right now?
15/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok u can
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma in Medical Lab. Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
15/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 295 0153: It's ok
15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I understand well
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
15/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Noted
15/11/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we are
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 + registration fee $1000= $2800 per annum
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
15/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
15/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So hw do you pay the total fee
15/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So I have to pay 100 then 900 and the other 900 on payment plan
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Sorry 1000👆🏿
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Not 100
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue our discussion however, since it is almost past our available working hours let us schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
16/11/23, 5:57 am - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
16/11/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Sharmaine,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since we were unable to continue our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we can  ,,cauz I will be conecting my mentor by 3
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Let me help you understand your query above. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Noted
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 295 0153: It's ok we can move on
16/11/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/11/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/11/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Sure
16/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

16/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their o-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the o-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Noted
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Sharmaine, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Well noted
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Well explaned
16/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
16/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
16/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Thank u so much ,,, same to you
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: you are most welcome.
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I'm doing another lesson with the EWYL
17/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Clear
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 295 0153: No
17/11/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your o-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes plz
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 295 0153: More information
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their o Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their diploma degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their o-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Clear now
17/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two o Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in O Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 6)*
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I think 5
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in O Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 295 0153: The next one
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 295 0153: So that I will choose the right one
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 295 0153: No
17/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Sharmaine's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/11/23, 4:55 am - +263 77 295 0153: Yes we are excited for the next step
18/11/23, 7:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sharmaine.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to hear that we wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 295 0153: Good morning
18/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 295 0153: Ok thank u
18/11/23, 8:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
