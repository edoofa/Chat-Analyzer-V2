10/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 556 0427: Oky Thank you the information
10/11/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
10/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 556 0427: Do you mean are they afford to pay for fees for international student without a scholarship
10/11/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: No, I am asking if they are aware of how much it costs
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: I am assuming they are now, therefore, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: In simple words Yolander, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/11/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: I hope this helps you understand?
10/11/23, 1:00 pm - Tushti: @263777708432 I would like for you to participate as well
10/11/23, 1:31 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 556 0427: Okay ma'am l understand
10/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 556 0427: Nowdays she is not online thus why she is not participating
10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Noted
10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/11/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/11/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: Do try to be prompt with your responses as my working hours for the day are about to end and I wish for you to proceed to the next stage soon
10/11/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: *As we celebrate the festival of Diwali here in India, we will now connect for our session on Tuesday at 12:00 PM CAT* Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

15/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 556 0427: Can you express the meaning of EWYL without using abbreviation s
15/11/23, 10:58 am - Tushti: Kindly go through this, dear
15/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 556 0427: As for me it's very good  for the student
15/11/23, 11:04 am - Tushti: Great
15/11/23, 11:04 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
15/11/23, 11:05 am - Tushti: Yolander, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/11/23, 12:04 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 556 0427: Okkky thank you with the information

15/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 556 0427: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 556 0427: $1500 _ $ 2 250
16/11/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 556 0427: Good afternoon
16/11/23, 4:21 pm - Tushti: I was waiting for your response the whole day
16/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 71 556 0427: I was the school .At the school we switch off our cellphone because nowadays we are writing end of year exams
17/11/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: This application has been put on hold until you can participate in the session and be active. The participation of your parents is also mandatory from now on
17/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 770 8432: Hie l'm Yolander Marange's parent
17/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: Good morning, @263777708432
17/11/23, 10:52 am - Tushti: I have observed that Yolander has not been consistently active on this group, therefore I would like to have today's session with you
17/11/23, 10:52 am - Tushti: I hope you shall be able to participate?
17/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 770 8432: Yea am willing to participate
17/11/23, 11:53 am - Tushti: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 11:53 am - Tushti: Noted
17/11/23, 11:53 am - Tushti: Kindly go through the conversation on this group thoroughly
17/11/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/11/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/11/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 770 8432: So how much can l pay for the enrollment am not much understanding
17/11/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: The amount would be $350, please!
17/11/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: Do you feel the family is prepared with that amount?
17/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 770 8432: What about the amount $750 what it will cover
17/11/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: Ms Makufa, you do not have to pay $750, you only have to pay $350 as the enrollment fee
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
17/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 770 8432: Yolander is now writing her end of term exams so she is bit caught up
17/11/23, 12:31 pm - Tushti: I understand, may I know at what time she would join us?
17/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 770 8432: Ok she will be free by 7 o'clock pm
17/11/23, 12:33 pm - Tushti: My working hours are from 9-5, please
17/11/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: I shall now share the rest of the process here on the group so that you and Yolander can go through all the information tonight and we can discuss any doubts you may have tomorrow
17/11/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
17/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 770 8432: Ok you can share
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Alright Yolander, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/11/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/11/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/11/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: *Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check*
17/11/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
