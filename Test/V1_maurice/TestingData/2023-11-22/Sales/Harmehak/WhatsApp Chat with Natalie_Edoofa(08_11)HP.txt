09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Natalie, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

09/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes l do
09/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright Natalie,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?

09/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Natalie!

09/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Ok ,, my family save money for my fees and they help me indirectly by teaching me how to use money wisely
09/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great Natalie!
09/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Would your parents be the one supporting your higher education in India financially?
09/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 032 3232: No they can not afford that's why lam seeking help
09/11/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand Natalie.
09/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: You just shared they are willing to support,

May I know who were you referring to?
09/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 032 3232: I meant that they will support me to get higher education abroad if l get a scholarship
09/11/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
09/11/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
09/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Ok l understand
09/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: So far are there any queries?
09/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 032 3232: No
09/11/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: So far are you clear that you would require financial support, Natalie?
09/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes
09/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

So what is your financial planning, Natalie?
09/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared document.
09/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
14/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Am sorry for not responding l was in the exam
15/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

15/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: I understand
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Have you gone through the document, Natalie?
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes a little bit
15/11/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
15/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 032 3232: 1 it help deserving students to get higher education with affordable fees and help them in getting into international universities and also it help in career guidance
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 032 3232: 2 the program reduces the cost and expenses of the high education ,,the scholarship may be a 50%_100% on tuition fee
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

What else did you learn about the finances involved, Natalie.
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 032 3232: It also help students with online part time internships and projects
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 032 3232: This help them to reduce their college fee
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Very correct,

And have you understood the following too?
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Oh ok l understand
15/11/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have better clarity regarding the finances involved?
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes l do
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Would you like to ask anything, Natalie?
15/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Yes so can Edoofa give you a scholarship and learn in your country
15/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please.

Can you rephrase your query, Natalie?
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Ok l mean can a student get a scholarship and study in his or her country
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: No please,

The scholarship is only for those who wish to study in India, Natalie.
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 032 3232: Oh l get it
