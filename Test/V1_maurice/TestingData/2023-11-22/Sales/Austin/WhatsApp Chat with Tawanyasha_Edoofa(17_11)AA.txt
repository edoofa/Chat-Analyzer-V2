India is said to be the best doctor breeding country and i really want to be part of the best as i wish to serve life.

2.I understood that the program wishes to sponsor scholarships to the young in order to open chances for them to own a brighy future and also help in building the community.

17/11/23, 1:51‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
17/11/23, 1:51‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program

We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic‚Äôs Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

17/11/23, 1:51‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
17/11/23, 1:57‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes indeed
17/11/23, 1:57‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
17/11/23, 1:57‚ÄØpm - Arshita: So now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why?*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)?*
*4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far?*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad?*
*8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?*
*9. Your school name and province in Zimbabwe*
17/11/23, 2:14‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: My strengths are my adaptability, my ability to learn quickly, and my analytical thinking skills. I am born a leader to an extent that i own many positions at my current school. This accounts for my ability to critical thinking skills. My weaknesses are my lack of experience in the real world, my family especially my siblings , and my occasional fear of not succeeding my dreams . My hobbies include reading, watching surgeon videos on YouTube , and spending time with friends and family. I come from a family that is not financially well-off. My parents work very hard to provide for our family, but sometimes it is still difficult to make ends meet. We have learned to be grateful for what we have and to appreciate the simple things in life. I am currently writing my final Ordinary level zimsec examinations. I would like to study medicine and be a surgeon this is because of quite a number of reasons. There are many reasons why I would want to be a surgeon. First, I think it is a very rewarding profession because you can directly help people and make a difference in their lives. Second, surgery is a field that requires a lot of skill and expertise, which I think would be challenging and exciting. Third, being a surgeon would allow me to use my knowledge and abilities to make a positive impact on the world.
My parents have a grocery shop in Mutare CBD
My parents highest education level is Ordinary Level. I also have a number of siblings. Twelve of us actually. The two eldest are married and the rest are at school. My father with the help of my uncle have been funding my education. My fees was $450 and the school is St Augustine high school in Manicaland province.
17/11/23, 2:27‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Tawanyasha, it's clear that you have a strong set of skills and a determined spirit. Your adaptability, quick learning ability, and analytical thinking skills are valuable assets, and your leadership positions at school reflect your natural leadership qualities. It's impressive that you are already taking on responsibilities and demonstrating critical thinking skills.
17/11/23, 2:27‚ÄØpm - Arshita: May I know do you have any past experience of learning in the field of medicine?
17/11/23, 2:30‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes but its just the first aid club at school
17/11/23, 2:31‚ÄØpm - Arshita: That is fine. 

May I know do you want to continue with A level?
17/11/23, 2:32‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes probably
17/11/23, 2:33‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Tawananyasha, I want to inform you that if you want to do a bachelor's you have to apply once you are in form 6.

In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
17/11/23, 2:46‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes i have researched about foreign education but i have never applied to University abroad

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
17/11/23, 3:10‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Absolutely! I have studied a variety of sources, including government documents, research studies, and news articles, about the Indian education system. From my research, I have learned that the system is complex and varied, with a wide range of schools, curricula, and funding sources. The quality of education varies greatly across the country, with rural areas often lacking access to the same resources as urban areas. The Indian education system has many strengths, including a strong focus on STEM subjects, a high rate of literacy among young people, and a growing number of women in higher education. India is home to some of the world's top universities, and its students consistently excel in international competitions and rankings. Additionally, India has a thriving private education sector that offers high-quality education to those who can afford it.
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.

17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there‚Äôs something for everyone in India‚Äôs massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *3. It‚Äô Affordable*- Compared to many of the world‚Äôs finest institutions, India‚Äôs low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *4. It‚Äôs the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India‚Äôs economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world‚Äôs third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
17/11/23, 3:11‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

17/11/23, 3:27‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Studying in India would be an excellent way to gain first-hand experience of the challenges and opportunities facing the Indian healthcare system. India is home to a vast and diverse population, and as a surgeon, I would need to be able to understand and work with people from all backgrounds. I also believe that studying in India would give me a unique perspective on healthcare that would be valuable in my career. Additionally, studying in India would expose me to cutting-edge medical research and technology, giving me the opportunity to learn from the best and brightest minds in the field. Ultimately, I believe that studying in India would make me a better surgeon.
17/11/23, 3:30‚ÄØpm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
17/11/23, 3:31‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Umm no
17/11/23, 3:33‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 3:34‚ÄØpm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:34‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
17/11/23, 3:36‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: I think so.
17/11/23, 3:38‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
17/11/23, 3:42‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: No
17/11/23, 3:43‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
17/11/23, 3:43‚ÄØpm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.
17/11/23, 3:43‚ÄØpm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/11/23, 3:43‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/11/23, 3:44‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
17/11/23, 3:44‚ÄØpm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.

17/11/23, 3:50‚ÄØpm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

17/11/23, 3:54‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Woww that's great
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/11/23, 3:55‚ÄØpm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
17/11/23, 3:58‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: The fact of higher education concierge
17/11/23, 3:59‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

17/11/23, 4:00‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Interesting i would also love that
17/11/23, 4:03‚ÄØpm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/11/23, 4:04‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: My father
17/11/23, 4:06‚ÄØpm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 4:10‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: They will actually be very happy and proud
17/11/23, 4:10‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
17/11/23, 4:10‚ÄØpm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
17/11/23, 4:10‚ÄØpm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
17/11/23, 4:16‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes that's it
17/11/23, 4:16‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
17/11/23, 4:16‚ÄØpm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/11/23, 4:17‚ÄØpm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 4:17‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
17/11/23, 4:21‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes please
17/11/23, 4:21‚ÄØpm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
17/11/23, 4:21‚ÄØpm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/11/23, 4:24‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Thats a very nice and appreciable deed
17/11/23, 4:32‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn‚Äôt have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student‚Äôs first year‚Äôs annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/11/23, 4:34‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: What if the student is Ordinary level
17/11/23, 4:35‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Then O level results will be considered
17/11/23, 4:35‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Thats great then
17/11/23, 4:35‚ÄØpm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 4:37‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Level 1
17/11/23, 4:38‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/11/23, 4:39‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes go on
17/11/23, 4:40‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
17/11/23, 4:40‚ÄØpm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/11/23, 4:40‚ÄØpm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
17/11/23, 4:40‚ÄØpm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
17/11/23, 4:42‚ÄØpm - +263 78 691 6304: Yes yes its very clear
17/11/23, 7:18‚ÄØpm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
