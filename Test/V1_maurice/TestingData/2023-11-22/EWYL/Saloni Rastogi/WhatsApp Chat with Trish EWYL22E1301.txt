_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

16/11/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1) *Daily Morning Ritual:* Each day, we'll kick things off by saying, "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL Line. 🌄 Let's remember that being an Edoofian means being a strong advocate for positive change, focused on self-improvement, and dedicated to making our families proud. The sky's the limit for us as true Edoofians! 🚀

📅 Wednesday Wisdom: Get ready for some midweek inspiration!

📋 Projects: We'll discuss our ongoing projects.
📬 Newsletter: Updates on the latest happenings.
16/11/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: 3) *Monthly Focus*: Every month, you have the opportunity to choose one project to work on passionately. Let's turn it into a fantastic "learning and earning experience." 💡💰

16/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you it, do let me know.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 71 215 5105: Thank you ma'am
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.

I hope this message finds you well. How are you doing?
Exciting news! Your sessions are scheduled for Mondays and Thursdays, running from 12:00 to 1:30 PM on the EWYL Line. As we gear up for the week, I'd like to remind you of a few things to keep the energy high and our connection strong:

1. Daily Ritual: Kickstart your day by proudly declaring 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line. It's not just a phrase; it's our way of staying connected and motivated.
2. Agenda for Our Session: In our upcoming session, we're diving into some engaging topics:
a. Saturday Activity: Share your experiences and insights.
b. Project Updates: Let's keep each other in the loop on our progress.
c. Newsletter Discussion: Your input is key to making it great!

I'm looking forward to catching up with you today! If you have any thoughts or questions beforehand, feel free to share. Let's make our sessions not just informative but interactive and enjoyable.
