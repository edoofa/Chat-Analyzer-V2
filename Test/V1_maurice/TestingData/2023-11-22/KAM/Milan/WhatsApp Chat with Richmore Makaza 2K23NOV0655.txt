Rhodyn Richmore Makaza is my name and I'm from Manicaland province. I was born in 2001 in Chimanimani district. My father was Josphat and he died in 2011when I was 10 and in grade 3 at Ndima Primary school which is about 3km away from our homestead. He was a carpenter and Swere Ngidi my mother took the burden over her shoulders and sent us, my twin sister Rholyn and I, to school. 
 
We then finished grade seven at Mutsvangwa primary school, 5km close to the Mozambican border, and mom was senting us to school with money got from piece works. We both get 6 units and was pleasing. 

We then went to Ndima Gvt High for the secondary education and there the fees was the challenge. Richman Makaza, my late father's young brother chipped in for the first 2 terms and he had a challenge since he is a driver and he had a family and childrn to take of too. So mother struggled to sent us to school till we finished ordinary level. I want to tahnk Richman for the support he gave us. We passed all the 8 subjects including Hexco to make them 9 with pleasing symbols. We then did A level in 2019 at Mafumise high school in the outskirts of chipinge districts and mother was bearing the burden for two more years. Richman chipped in registering exams snd I appreciated that. 

My mother earn money but selling bananas in fruit markets. Now my twin sister is at Mutare poly doing IT. I gave her the opportunity to go to tetiary education since mom couldn't afford to pay fees for us since the fees are unbearable.
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your incredible journey with such depth. Your resilience and determination are truly inspiring. It's evident that your family, especially your mother and Uncle Richman, have played pivotal roles in shaping your educational path.

Your dedication to your twin sister's education despite financial constraints speaks volumes about your character. Providing her the opportunity for tertiary education while acknowledging the challenges your family faced demonstrates your selflessness and admirable values.
