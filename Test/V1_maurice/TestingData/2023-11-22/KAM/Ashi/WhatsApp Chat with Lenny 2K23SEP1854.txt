09/11/23, 7:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

09/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/11/23, 7:23 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I am following
09/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-

09/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

09/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

14/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lenny, I hope you are doing well. 

Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past couple of days, we were celebrating a major Indian festival - "Festival of Lights" which is also known as Diwali. 

It is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
14/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. I am sure once you are in India, you will be able to celebrate this happy festival with us and experience all of these emotions.
14/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am excited to commence today's session. Kindly let me know if you are ready to proceed, and I look forward to our meaningful time together.
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes I am ready
14/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @27844483976, I am glad to see that you have completed the form shared with you, However I would like to understand why have you written 25th of November as your EWYL Program Availability date and 01st of December as your Orientation date, Could you please share your response on this ?

14/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that on 17th he will be writing his exams. However, Starting the EWYL program should not adversely affect his exams. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help him prepare for his exams more effectively. By participating in the program, his can enhance his study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.

However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and his exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in. <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if Lenny is occupied with exams, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I am trying to listen to all the videos I can only hear small small talking about the scholarship and the benefits of being an Edoofian and the steps you take to have the scholarship I can't hear properly
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 Let me help you summarize a additional insights with you which helps you in understanding the videos.
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes thank you
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27844483976. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

15/11/23, 9:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:36 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
15/11/23, 10:40 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Most of these documents I have to wait for Lenny to bring them
15/11/23, 10:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 May I know if you can get these documents from Lenny?
16/11/23, 6:03 am - +27 84 448 3976: Not until he finishes his exams and bring them because he is at the school it's not easy to get in touch with him but as from the 20th of November i can be able to talk to him

16/11/23, 11:46 am - +27 84 448 3976: This second form is it me who is going to answer because I never studied sociology only Lenny knows about these things  not me
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 We truly understand that Lenny is occupied with his exams and you will be able to connect with him on 20th of November. On this note, I would like to know if Lenny could share his document with us in this group as it will only take few minutes.
16/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (17-Nov-2023).
16/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/FfZTUXdty0n2C53KAPg0U0
16/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Lenny Leonel Chiduma, and my EWYL group name is Lenny EWYL23E0895. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (17-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
16/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
16/11/23, 1:38 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Like I said I can't connect with because they don't allow them to have phones during examination time I have only the photo of O level results and passport
16/11/23, 1:39 pm - +27 84 448 3976: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:42 pm - +27 84 448 3976: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know @27844483976 and sharing the available documents with us, we have duly noted the update with us. I hope you have taken a note of my above messages, could you kindly confirm please
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I am still waiting for them to reply
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @27844483976, They will surely reply to you soon.
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes that's true
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/11/23, 2:34 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/11/23, 3:08 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/11/23, 3:12 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
16/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - +27 84 448 3976: You have to excuse me until 8pm I am going to church now
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, We will surely connect at 8pm today
16/11/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lenny, I hope you are doing well. 

May I know if you are available for the session?
16/11/23, 8:03 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
16/11/23, 8:14 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/11/23, 8:19 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Last conversation you say if we pay $350 I have reserved a seat
16/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 Let me clarify that you have paid $350 for the enrollment of Edoofa Scholarship Program, I hope you remember. Now, we are talking about University Registration.
16/11/23, 8:26 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
16/11/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I am concerned about how soon we have to pay that $750
16/11/23, 8:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern reagrding the registration fee payment. Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
16/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
16/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27844483976. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 8:41 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Three to Five days is that not too soon after I receive that letter we have to pay $750 ,not now at this time of the year we won't manage to pay that amount, unless we will pay it nextyear
16/11/23, 8:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 We will surely help you in that concern, for now let's please continue with the session please I hope you have gone through above messages.
16/11/23, 8:45 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
16/11/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
16/11/23, 8:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/11/23, 8:48 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27844483976, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lenny, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
17/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: We are all fine lets connect at 5pm as I am busy with something right now
17/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @27844483976, Thank you for letting me know. Let's reconnect at 5pm.
17/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @27844483976, I hope you are doing well. 

 I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
17/11/23, 5:12 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes I am available
17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
17/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Lenny, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. Lenny will be the trailblazer among the peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/11/23, 5:17 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 5:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
17/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 5:27 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 5:31 pm - +27 84 448 3976: I understand all the things that you are saying I am wondering why is this process very long and this 750 that you are talking about I hope it is to be paid after the A level results are out
17/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 Today hopefully we will conclude our session, the delays has been occurred due to the delay in the forms. However, we are on the right track now, kindly don't worry. Although, I want to share that the Registration fees will be paid before the A level results as the offer letter will be shared with you soon once we complete this process.

You don't have to worry about paying the registration fee right now. Let me help you in understanding the process -  you'll receive multiple offers from different universities. Once you've made your final decision on which university to pusue your Higher Education, that's when we will proceed with your admission application, at that time you need to complete the registration payment. 

Please rest assured that we are here to support you every step of the way, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free admission journey. If you have any more questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Your academic success is our top priority.
17/11/23, 5:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand
17/11/23, 5:41 pm - +27 84 448 3976: The only thing is that I am a parent I have a lot of things to do during the day it will be better to continue with Lenny I willbe there to help him because so far there is a lot of things that he is supposed to know also about this scholarship after his exams I am sure he is supposed to go through these things the videos and everything so that it will be easy for him to understand the EWYL program, I can't explain everything to him, I won't be able to say everything
17/11/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We truly agree with you understanding @27844483976, and you are absolutely right. It's important for Lenny to understand the whole process and I am sure she will go through our conversation and follow them the same. However if she would have any concern we are always here for her to help her out and understand everything. 

Considering that the students from all over the world are competing for the scholarship seat, we want to make sure that we have the best for Lenny that's why we have encourage you to have the session with us in her absence. On this note, May I know if we can continue with our today's session as we are about to complete the process today, Could you please share your response?
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Let's proceed
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/11/23, 6:32 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/11/23, 6:45 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/11/23, 6:49 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
17/11/23, 6:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27844483976 May I please know if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 9:30 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes sorry was busy a little bit

17/11/23, 9:34 pm - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
17/11/23, 9:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With this I would like to share that we can completed our discussion for now, we are only waiting for the A level document now once we receive the same then we will move forward for Lenny's Application. Please make sure to keep us posted with the progress of the document.

20/11/23, 8:15 am - +27 84 448 3976: Hello admission officer  I'm now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Jasmine and she has scheduled my session for 20/11 /23
20/11/23, 8:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lenny, I hope you are doing well.
