Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you in the past couple of days. I have took initiative and have a discussion with the academic board and University since the intake you wanted to join was August 2023 and it's already been four months. If you plans to come India right now you would have miss out a lot of classes by default. 

Hence, the academic board mentioned that if the student want to change the academic intake we can successfully help you in that matter, I'll help you with the procedure which you have to undertake in order to change your admission intake.
09/11/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, The academic board has shared that you are eligible for one of the other university which is MVN University, The arrival for this university are open till 15th of Nov. In case you want to join the same university that can be a possibility. With this university, There is an additional benefits of Higher Quantum of Scholarship. Please do let me know if you want to explore this option.
10/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 236 4594: They once tried that, before. If someone choose something that you can't or what's not at the University,it's proper to say it ,than to raise people's hope and make people pay money.  Knowingly it's hard to deliver. Now you asking for another alternative. Which is good,but why was the alternatives,asked before.
10/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 236 4594: I don't understand how, you do things you do. Do you base on trails, if this fail,you try another one. What are those universities offer. We choose something they don't have again.
10/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 236 4594: Adoofa and Higher Quantum they do both scholarships. We paid Edoofa,are we going to be refunded and we pay Higher Quantum?

10/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 236 4594: Postmortem,of the failed one?
14/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Whitney, I hope you are doing well. 

Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past couple of days, we were celebrating a major Indian festival - "Festival of Lights" which is also known as Diwali. 

It is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
14/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. I am sure once you are in India, you will be able to celebrate this happy festival with us and experience all of these emotions.

14/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Whitney, Let me clarify that Higher Quantum we have mentioned means that we are talking about higher percentage of scholarship, which will be assisted by Edoofa only. Moving Further, Let me summarize my previous message, With respect to your journey the academic board has shared some recommendation with us that you are eligible for one of the university which is MVN University where you can get the higher amount of scholarship. However, if you don't want to change your University, you can change your academic year which means you can come to India next year. Please do let me know if this is clear?

15/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 236 4594: It's time for you to rejoice. With us nothing to rejoice, we paid money for child to learn. You never mentioned,hat went wrong,why you cancelled her intake. You just offered another option,which needs more money. You push for payments, when paid , you sit on information. Asked for postmortem for what happened. You never respond. You failed us, you don't explain anything. Failing something, doesnt mean you didn't put effort. You say it for the way forward' s sake . You are asking for another $250 top up , you failed us again, you will look for another option you will need again a top . It doesn't work that way. They we paid ,you are making out of it,since the child was not enrolled.

20/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 236 4594: The choices, are not favourable to us . She mentioned,there is an enrollment in less than 2 weeks,( end of November) .She doesn't have a visa, planning purposes.8 working days it's not enough. Then she mentioned, about August next year (2024). It's sad are the efforts and hustle we went through,was for nothing,wasted time too. After all no explanation on what went wrong.
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 236 4594: We have decided, August 2024, will waiting. Hoping what happened won't repeat it's self. As it is our money we paid is in air.$700 which meant to hold her place at the University never saved it's purpose. Can Mr Shorwi refund us our deposit for the university,so that we can rotate it.by 9 months to e it will be more than double the amount. Will just pay once and for all, when August 2024 comes. Maybe there will also better offers from India universities,under Edoofa program
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that the updates shared with you are not favorable. However, as Ms. Vilsha must have informed you the other day, you are already quite behind in joining the academic intake of August. While we want to assist you in joining the universities at this time, it would be an academic burden on your child and hence this is something that is beyond our control as well. The alternative options have already been presented to you and if you feel you are not comfortable with the same, in that case, all we can do is wait for the next academic intake of August 2024.
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With regards to your message, I have taken note that you have decided for your daughter to join the academic intake of August 2024 at Gulzar Group of Institutes, and I will update the university accordingly. 

Also to address the query you asked - No, the registration fee paid cannot be refunded since it has been adjusted forward to reserve your scholarship seat with the university. The assurance of helping you hold your scholarship seat for another year is given based on the same. The amount has already been invested, and as per the policies, it cannot be processed for anything else. I hope you understand this update and will work your best to prepare for the 2024 arrival.
20/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 236 4594: Why reserved it,as it's your money. You make it fail so that you use people' s money. Why are you so sure ,she will go to Gulzar. The money was not paid at Gulzar. You Edoofa you are taking advantage of our money.  Over a year, keeping someone' s and using it to your advantage. Do think it's practical. You can to Zimbabwe in the name trying to help, while hiding behind the name scholarship.
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 236 4594: Why are you forcing on our money. Are you a bank how much are interest are you paying us for keeping our money, without our permission
20/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 236 4594: Diwali was it part of celebrating" s money . This Zimbabwe Shorwi is he a conman ?
