My big sister is studying Engineering and my big brother is in Botswana doing a variety of works in order to live.
My young brother is in grade seven

My father used to support me on my education so far and also Mrs Mable used to help me in my academics

I guess Mrs Mable will be supporting my education abroad because my father said that he will no longer support me on my university because of financial burden

My school fees was $150 per term but because l used to be the best student every term l was promoted and  l paid half of the school fees that is $75

My father is a messenger in a industrial company in Kadoma

I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

*Tech Savvy*‚Äì In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*‚Äì This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*‚Äì This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*‚Äì Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

18/11/23, 11:44‚ÄØam - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?

18/11/23, 11:56‚ÄØam - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
18/11/23, 11:58‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: I am not familiar at all sir
18/11/23, 11:58‚ÄØam - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/11/23, 11:59‚ÄØam - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 11:59‚ÄØam - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/11/23, 12:03‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: I understand it all sir .. thank you for guiding me
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
18/11/23, 12:04‚ÄØpm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
18/11/23, 12:10‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: According to my own perspective, Earn while you learn programme will be benefiting  a lot
18/11/23, 12:18‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
18/11/23, 12:22‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: This is Amazing and interesting Mr Kunal
18/11/23, 12:32‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/11/23, 12:32‚ÄØpm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/11/23, 12:32‚ÄØpm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
18/11/23, 12:32‚ÄØpm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
18/11/23, 12:37‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: Out of 4 l like point 4 the most
18/11/23, 12:39‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

18/11/23, 12:40‚ÄØpm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
18/11/23, 12:46‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: As once noted above  Mrs Mutangadura and My father will be helping in the remaining fee after the Edoofa  schoolarship
18/11/23, 12:48‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: And the earn while you learn program
18/11/23, 12:48‚ÄØpm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/11/23, 12:50‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: My family feels jovial about me studying abroad
18/11/23, 12:54‚ÄØpm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
18/11/23, 12:54‚ÄØpm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
18/11/23, 1:00‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
18/11/23, 1:07‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: Language proficiency
Academic transcript
Visa application
Home country requirements
18/11/23, 1:08‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
18/11/23, 1:08‚ÄØpm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/11/23, 1:08‚ÄØpm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 1:11‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: That is  great sir
18/11/23, 1:14‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/11/23, 1:14‚ÄØpm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
18/11/23, 1:14‚ÄØpm - Kunal: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/11/23, 1:21‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: Am following can we   proceed
18/11/23, 1:22‚ÄØpm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 1:23‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: We have completed the stage 1
18/11/23, 1:24‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: That is personalized counseling session
18/11/23, 1:25‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/11/23, 1:27‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: Yes sir go ahead
18/11/23, 1:27‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
18/11/23, 1:27‚ÄØpm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
18/11/23, 1:27‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
18/11/23, 1:29‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: It is clearly understood
18/11/23, 1:31‚ÄØpm - +263 78 131 7814: Thank you very much for the counseling sessionüëèüëè
18/11/23, 1:31‚ÄØpm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

19/11/23, 10:28‚ÄØpm - +263 77 321 2610: Good evening, Sir. Unfortunately, as a family, we could not afford the remaining fees, for we are currently having financial problems. Thank you for the opportunity, and God bless you. We are looking for more opportunities
20/11/23, 8:42‚ÄØam - Austin#276: Good Morning to you all!
20/11/23, 8:43‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: Morning how are you Mr Austin
20/11/23, 8:44‚ÄØam - Austin#276: I am doing well, Blessing!
20/11/23, 8:44‚ÄØam - Austin#276: I do understand the challenges, may I ask which financial aspect of the program do you find is challenging for you?
20/11/23, 8:46‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: The admission fee and registration fee Mr Austin
20/11/23, 8:50‚ÄØam - Austin#276: As per your understand Blessing, how much is the Admissions fees and registration fee?
20/11/23, 8:53‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: Admission fee is $350 , the first payment which is $200  is to be paid in 7days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in 30 days.

Registration fee is around $500-1000
20/11/23, 8:57‚ÄØam - Austin#276: That is correct Blessing!
20/11/23, 8:58‚ÄØam - Austin#276: The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2000 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2000-600= $1400
20/11/23, 9:03‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: I really understand Mr Austin but as for me l am under my parent's authority . There is no way l can change what they say since they said they are not able to afford the costs.l don't know what to do now Mr Austin
20/11/23, 9:25‚ÄØam - Austin#276: This is understandable, Blessing but have you compared the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program with that in Zimbabwe?
20/11/23, 9:26‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: Yes l compared Mr Austin but as a child l am controlled by Parents I don't know what they are planning for me right now
20/11/23, 9:27‚ÄØam - Austin#276: Is your parents/parent available for a discussion?
20/11/23, 9:30‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: My father has no WhatsApp account and he is not available at the moment.in this group there is my Aunt and sister l don't know if they have any say concerning this issue
20/11/23, 9:38‚ÄØam - Austin#276: So how are you planning to connect us to your family and discuss further proceedings?
20/11/23, 9:43‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: For now they are busy . Mybe they shall attend you after they are free
20/11/23, 9:49‚ÄØam - Austin#276: By what time can I expect to hear from them?
20/11/23, 9:57‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: I think the best way is to cancel this process Mr Austin . I don't think if there is going to be any change
20/11/23, 10:04‚ÄØam - Austin#276: Well Blessing, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
20/11/23, 10:04‚ÄØam - Austin#276: @~üìñ At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
20/11/23, 10:05‚ÄØam - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 10:05‚ÄØam - Austin#276: Now, if you feel to let go this once in a life time opportunity, I can cancel your application and allot the scholarship seat to the next student in waiting
20/11/23, 10:05‚ÄØam - Austin#276: But if you still wish to discuss with your family, I can provide you the time for the same
20/11/23, 10:08‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: I understand Mr Austin .you can cancel this is what my parent's decision.As for my decision l wanted to study in India but there is nothing l can do
20/11/23, 10:21‚ÄØam - Austin#276: Noted Blessing, wish you the best ahead!
20/11/23, 10:31‚ÄØam - +263 78 131 7814: Thank you Mr Austin and all the group members in this groupüëèüëè
