27/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 777 9202: That is much better then, as you said not everyone can afford a quality education but all thanks to you

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

31/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 777 9202: I suppose I'm not familiar with any
31/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Because there's increased Career Opportunities and cross-cultural communication skills.

 Studying in India quickly and effectively build proficiencies that will help me excel. It may also  improve my teamwork, leadership, and communication abilities. 



In addition, practically all colleges and universities use modern technology to improve instruction.
31/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear that
31/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/10/23, 2:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Thank you
31/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 777 9202: This is great news indeed
31/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
31/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Yes it may be affordable
31/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
31/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Through the *Earn While You Learn program*
31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: You are right

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Yes l think so
31/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
31/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 777 9202: I clearly understand
31/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
31/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
31/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
31/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
31/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
31/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 777 9202: I liked all of them but mostly 3
31/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

31/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 777 9202: my biological mother will be helping me
31/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Thank you, I'm impressed.
31/10/23, 2:40 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 777 9202: They feel like
Learning in different environments particularly abroad will allow me  to understand new ways of thinking, teaching me new ways to solve problems will help me prepare  for the unknown future in the world where concepts and standards are constantly changing.

Also they feel anxious but at the same time proud of me and happy for me
31/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 777 9202: They feel happy as they are certain that the Education System abroad is well recommendable specifically of India more than here
31/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
31/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
31/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Yes that too, it will please my family to the greatest extent
31/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
31/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 777 9202: I think those are the most essentials among others
31/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
31/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Thank you for compromising
31/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 777 9202: All Thanks to Edoofa for all this
31/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
31/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
31/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
31/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 777 9202: I have clearly understood
31/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 777 9202: It's alright
31/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 777 9202: This is probably much better
31/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 777 9202: We have just come to the end of stage 1
31/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
31/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Yes you can explain it
31/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Alright
31/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
31/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
31/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Yes, very clear
31/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 777 9202: Thank you
31/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
31/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Furthermore, if you have any other query I would suggest that you note down all of the questions and get back to me

Are you ready for the same?
01/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 367 8209: How are you Sir ? Yvonne is not yet ready
01/11/23, 11:09 am - Austin#276: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Precious

I hope you are doing well
01/11/23, 11:09 am - Austin#276: I am doing well by the Grace of God, thanks for asking
This is well noted
01/11/23, 11:09 am - Austin#276: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 367 8209: Sure with the Grace of God am fine
01/11/23, 11:14 am - Austin#276: Glad to hear that!
01/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 367 8209: Yes I  was following the sessions, from what I have learnt so far ,the program is good for sure and it gives the room for learning new skills
01/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 367 8209: For now l do not have questions
01/11/23, 11:23 am - Austin#276: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
01/11/23, 11:24 am - Austin#276: Noted,
May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 367 8209: On the financial aspect the fees are fair but it's only that we can not afford due to our limited resources and source of income ,also our economic situation is hard
01/11/23, 11:35 am - Austin#276: I do understand the challenges and economic constraints, Mrs Precious!
May I know, which financial aspect of the program do you feel is challenging to you and family?
01/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 367 8209: To be honest with you if I pay $200 I will also need 30 days to pay $150
01/11/23, 11:41 am - Austin#276: That is absolutely fine, Mrs Precious, in fact the the payment plan allows you to pay the remaining $150 in 30 days
01/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 367 8209: Okay it's fine
01/11/23, 11:45 am - Austin#276: Moreover, Mrs Precious, our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
01/11/23, 11:46 am - Austin#276: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?*
01/11/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 367 8209: Very sure that's my expectation
01/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 367 8209: Very true and it is the situation our graduates are experiencing
01/11/23, 11:51 am - Austin#276: Absolutely, Mrs Precious!
01/11/23, 11:52 am - Austin#276: While going through the profile of Yvonne, I also noted that she is from Mufakose High, Harare which is one of our associate schools in Harare under the guidance of Mrs Kusotera and we have Edoofians from the school!
01/11/23, 11:52 am - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 11:53 am - Austin#276: Students from Mufakose High participated at our Global Education Summit!
01/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 367 8209: Okay aaaa that's good  news
01/11/23, 11:54 am - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 11:54 am - Austin#276: *A total of 370+ Edoofians were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for this intake so far*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality. Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity. We have a former student of *Mufakose 1 High who arrived recently*

*Hazel T Manjoro*
Yvonne might know her as her senior!
01/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 367 8209: You are doing extremely good to our children,keep on having a good heart and team spirit, am sure she might remember Hazel
01/11/23, 11:58 am - Austin#276: Thank you for your good words and you can enquire to Yvonne about Hazel!
01/11/23, 11:58 am - Austin#276: May I know, at what time will Yvonne be available for a discussion?
