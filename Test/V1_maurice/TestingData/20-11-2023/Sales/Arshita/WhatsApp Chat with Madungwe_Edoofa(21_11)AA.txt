*I am Ms. Arshita, career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us,  Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor  and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by Ruvimbo 

As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *11:30AM CAT Tuesday (21/11/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counselling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
