What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
She was a church member who I rarely saw but she only highlighted that the edoofa always ensures that everything is done legitimately and making sure that every student who is up for their studies are well supported and taken care of.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

Like any other less privileged student who wishes to support herself, family and community.. believing that I might want to expand my education with a chance that will assist me with my career,that is the reason why I am applying for this scholarship.
