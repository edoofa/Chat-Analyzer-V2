07/11/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: Sure
07/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Waiting for this message
07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: Its a pleasure to connect with you, Ms Magaya
07/11/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: Can you please answer the question?
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 338 7901: The thought of it was from our salaries since we are both teachers . Though the monies will not be enough but as civil servants we have access to loans . Though this will strain our welfare  in trying to send these 2 to school their education is crutial and their success academically will help us also to have a better life in the future . We deeply depend on salaries for survival food , health , transport monies and also for paying school fees . And because of this we have also failed to further our studies so that we focus on the education of my sister and brother and also to get food on the table daily .
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 338 7901: I work where there is limited netwrk access so i might take long to receive and respond to messages
07/11/23, 3:41 pm - Tushti: Thank you for answering, @263713387901
07/11/23, 3:41 pm - Tushti: Do you believe it would be feasible for you to raise around $2000 per year for Tendai's higher studies abroad?
07/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Its a little bit expensive for us  as we depend on salaries . Above all my mother is a bread winner in her family so she supports others like my grandmother apart from Tendai and Panashe (my brother )
07/11/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: I understand, I really do, which is why we also help our students by providing them with opportunities to earn while they learn, thereby self sponsoring their higher education
07/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Earning ...you mean by working and what kind of jobs and also do you help in securing the jobs for them
07/11/23, 5:02 pm - Tushti: We have the Earn While You Learn Program through which our students self sponsor their tertiary education
07/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Earn while u earn  is ok ...... As long as someone is doing her desired program and the work doesn't interfere much with her studies..... And age appropriate
07/11/23, 5:21 pm - Tushti: I shall be briefing you about the Program in great details as we proceed with the session
07/11/23, 5:22 pm - Tushti: However, I must first understand whether the family has prepared for the student's higher education abroad
07/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Prepared you min the visa and ticket etc?
07/11/23, 5:25 pm - Tushti: No, I am referring to the financial planning
07/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 338 7901: We wish her to get better higher education . And insuch  we wish that she can study abroad if the fees are something we can afford . Limitations are our financial constraints . We can do it....On Zimbabwe we sacrifice Education even of things seem tough that's why we do side hustles...even if we are formally employed.U might not understand how we do it.My mother took me to university and took care of my siblings when she was the only  provider ,now we are two we can do it with your help of course and work while u earn
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Tushti: That's exactly what I wished to understnd
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Tushti: Now, kindly share the O Level and L5 term results for evaluation
07/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Can i get back to you later . I have to call her and she will ask from the admin since she had submitted the O level results wen she was enrolled and also i have to ask if the L5 report card she has it at school or if she left it hime during the holidays . Shes a boarder . So she will need to get a pass  n collect it
07/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 338 7901: For the mean time can i send the narration of her results while i wait for her to send pictures of the results
07/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 338 7901: O level results

07/11/23, 6:25 pm - Tushti: Now, as you might know, Aerospace Engineering, the course which she wishes to do is a niche course and also happens to be one of the most expensive courses offered in Universities
07/11/23, 6:25 pm - Tushti: Therefore I would recommend that she study Mechanical Engineering Instead
07/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 455 3293: How much is it... That's the best
07/11/23, 6:26 pm - Tushti: I believe the course fees could be around $4000 per year for Aerospace Engineering
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 338 7901: How much will this costs
07/11/23, 6:46 pm - Tushti: That would be around $2000 per year, further reduced by the students Earn While You Learn Projects
07/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Shes studying pretty hard for this course tts her dream
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Tushti: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Tushti: Sure
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Iam done reading . Thank you.We also support Indian Universities from the knowledge we had about it and the  verified facts you presented.
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - Tushti: Amazing @263774553293 as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
08/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 455 3293: No madam, but only know that the few students who did  similar courses were sponsored by international scholarships.
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: In simple words @263774553293 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Wonderful .... Thanks to Edoofa for giving people including us foreigners such an opportunity.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes, madam
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/11/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
08/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Reading ..... Will come back to you after I'm done reading. Thank you
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: Sure
08/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 455 3293: That's really wonderful...and the scheme makes it even easier for the family if the student is hardworking.Iam glad to know some of the familiar surnames like Mandebvu and Mbedzi.We just hope to be a success too.
08/11/23, 3:19 pm - Tushti: I am sure Tendai will soon be a part of the Edoofa Family!
08/11/23, 3:19 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes
08/11/23, 3:19 pm - Tushti: @263774553293 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Wow.... wonderful Thank you!!!!
08/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Noted
08/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 455 3293: $1500-$2250
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Tushti: Exactly @263774553293 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Really? Wonderful!
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Wow
08/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes, that pretty helpful and promotes high chances of being enrolled
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
08/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes I do.

Tendai wants to enrol in 2025.because currently she is in form 5. So can the  application  and payment done even this year to make sure that we won't lose the chance or it has to wait until she is in form 6?Again  she is not authorised to use phones during the school term unless under special request for a few days.Hence it will be effectively done during the school holidays?Is it feasible?We need your advice on this.
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Yes, the payment can be done this year to reserve the seat
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: Alright , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 455 3293: So, does step 5 commence after A level results are out?So all these other steps can be done now....except for that which I said it needs to wait for school holidays?Is that so?
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Yes
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 455 3293: We can proceed madam.
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 2 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

The genocide in the landlocked South Eastern county of Rwanda left the citizens in a sorry state of affairs to a greater extent.Many people were left homeless,some paralyzed some were disconnected from their families through death and some are now almost permanent refugees in foreign land.Most men perished in war and currently it is one one the countries with  its population mostly youths.  

Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence.
Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. Countless survivors developed long-term psychological problems.Finally, a study 16 years after the genocide, including 114 survivors of mean age 47 years, reports that 46% suffered from PTSD, 59% from anxiety, and another 46% from current depression. 17 These figures are considerably higher in study for all mental disorders.

Despite the abundance of human and natural resources in Rwanda, a huge portion of the population still lives below the international poverty line (living on less than $2.15 a day). Poverty in Rwanda is worse especially in the rural areas where the majority of the population lives.
 
However, Rwanda today is a vibrant destination for tourism. One of the first things most people notice is that Kigali is spotlessly clean. Residents of Rwanda enjoy a low corruption rate and high quality of life, making the country an ideal location for innovative ideas, research, and exploration.

Zimbabwe is preparing to host Nigeria in Rwanda for it's FIFA Soccer game.So, Rwanda is upgrading its nation to international standards as seen by its seven international stadium which hosts up to 30000 people each.

Hopefully it will soon upgrade the livelihoods of its citizens.

My lnspirational Story 

With fierce  competition for food ,territory and shelter , life in the jungle progresses by one law the law of natural selection ,something ,Charles Darwin refered to as survival  of the  fittest .Success belongs to those that are willing to be visionaries , strategies , communicators ,adaptors ,these are the attributes embodied by all carnivores .

Prey hide themselves from the predator , they do so by camouflage and finding strength in numbers .Big cats such as lions  , leopards tigers ,and cheetahs use their visionary eyes ,and at times their unique sense of smell to locate is hidden environments. Similary only visionary people can see the hidden attributes about a question .

Once the prey has been located ,the next thing is strategy development .Lions do not haphazardly attack a herd of buffalos ,they are cognisant of the fact that these animals can fight back and maim even kill a big cat in a 'do or die' encounter  .lnstead ,the lions team up in groups of four or five and use a 'cow horn ' formation to encircle and attack the herd .To be a successful person, you are encouraged to work in  smaller groups in order to share ideas and experiences and sharpen each others line of thought . The strategy here is isolate then attack one beast from the herd .

When an animal has been isolated ,the next thing is to move with speed and accuracy like a cheetah .Carnivores attack from behind ,tackle the prey without wasting time ,aim for the throat  .This stops the prey from breathing and the carnivore can suck the blood of the beast.As the animal loses its blood ,its life ebbs away and eventually it stops convulsing and dead next to the carnivore . And this marks success and excellency to do ordinary things extraordinarily . <This message was edited>

Thanks you for the Acceptance letter.We read the contents and we understood and accepted the terms and conditions .We are going to deposit the initial deposit within the stipulated timeframe.
17/11/23, 8:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
17/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir I'm available
17/11/23, 9:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I hope you have gone through Tendai's Acceptance letter?
17/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 455 3293: Yes  sir
17/11/23, 9:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
17/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 455 3293: No sir
17/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Tendai's acceptance letter?
17/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 455 3293: It's 22 November.......for the  first $200 .....and 22 December....for the remaining $150
17/11/23, 10:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, And are you clear with the Transaction methods as well?
17/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 455 3293: Yes, I opt for the FBC Zimbabwean account for Mr Kawadza..... that's the one I understand better.....then I will forward the proof of payment to you sir
17/11/23, 10:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
17/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 338 7901: Number 2 of depositing in the associates account here in zimbabwe
17/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 455 3293: Option 2
17/11/23, 11:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
17/11/23, 11:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
17/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 338 7901: In the letter it is stated that it is 11% so which one is correct 11% or 12.5%
17/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please, there must have been a typing error in the letter, It's 12.5%
17/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Oky sir thank you
17/11/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions yoou would like to ask?
17/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 338 7901: No sir
17/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please!
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

18/11/23, 9:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that, So are there any questions you would like to ask?
18/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 338 7901: No bt am just happy and glad that you and the Edoofa team  are doing a great job in helping kids have their dream courses and later on jobs . And in such helping parents .
18/11/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please
18/11/23, 10:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before we begin the session are there any questions you would like to ask?
18/11/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
18/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 338 7901: I have no questions sir but what i can say is i have poor reception so thats why am taking too long to respond
18/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I understand please!
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, Ms Maurice @263713387901 Tendai's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 22nd of November, 2023, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
18/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Not sure about the wxact day but we have the part paymemt of $200 plus the 12.5%  and she said she will be going to town to deposit it this coming week
18/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263713387901  you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
18/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
18/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Oky sir
18/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 338 7901: So since mom will be depositing $200 this week is it possible for me to deposit the $150 first to make it the whole amount by the end of the week . I will be in town on monday thats why am asking  and im farway from mom to give her so that she can make a single payment
18/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate?
18/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Am asking if its possible that i deposit $150 on monday and mom deposit also mybe tues this coming week . Is there anyproblem if we do that .
19/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 455 3293: I'm Sorry I was offline for days without notice I was attending a relative's  funeral and there was no network.Iam going to deposit  the $200 tomorrow  on  Monday 20 November
