Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
17/11/23, 3:14â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

20/11/23, 2:50â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so @27734200758, After understanding *Quinton's* interests and motivation 
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts in Psychology*
20/11/23, 2:54â€¯pm - +27 73 420 0758: Thanks very much,that will do
20/11/23, 3:44â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: Shall I brief you about the course in detail?
20/11/23, 3:47â€¯pm - +27 73 420 0758: Yes please
20/11/23, 3:52â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
20/11/23, 3:54â€¯pm - +27 73 420 0758: Thanks very much
20/11/23, 3:56â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 3:56â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/11/23, 4:00â€¯pm - +27 73 420 0758: We hope he will achieve the best points when the form six results are out,thanks
20/11/23, 4:14â€¯pm - Shubham Madhwal: now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
20/11/23, 4:48â€¯pm - +27 73 420 0758: Yes if you may elaborate more

5. *Global Recognition and Career Prospects:* Indian degrees are globally recognized, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities worldwide. Graduates from Indian institutions have achieved success in various fields globally.
