03/08/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
03/08/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 806 7002: We can start
03/08/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 647 4974: We can start
03/08/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 647 4974: You can explain i have gone through it
03/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
03/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
03/08/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Clear you can go ahead
03/08/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
03/08/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
03/08/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Following and clear.
03/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
03/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
03/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Clear and understood.
03/08/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
03/08/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes we can proceed.
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
03/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
03/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 647 4974: On our schedule time by 7:30 i will be ready to continue
03/08/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have a note of our discussion hours @263776474974, indeed we shall reconnect again today at 07.30 PM.
03/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Thank you
03/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
03/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Connected
03/08/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
03/08/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes we have gone through them
03/08/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the videos in detail?
03/08/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: All of them in one summary or one by one
03/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely your wish, you can share your understanding as you think is convenient for you.
03/08/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 806 7002: From the videos i understood that a lot of students are failing to be enrolled in the universities because of a lot reasons. Some of the reasons are because they do not follow instructions. They explained that it is very important to follow instructions from our sessions with our counselor. Secondly i understood that the student should be open minded. I also learnt that most students are not able to covince universities because they think education is all about making money but education is about saving the community we are living today therefore our counselors help us with some of the knowledge on these aspects.
03/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 806 7002: They also mentioned that  some students may be tricked in their scholarships but Edoofa can transfer their papers from one country to another within 30 days. This can only be done if you pay attention and if you follow instructions. Edoofa program help us to make our education affordable by exposing us to countries that offer high and quality education but if and only if you are open minded. Lastly they mentioned that for us to convince thr universities we have to write things that do not make them think that we are all about making money but we want to build our generation by our minds which think foward which is the idea of being open minded. 

This is what i have understood from the videos.
03/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I gave understood that students have have to enroll and register for Edoofa program.  Edoofa is offering life transforming scholarships.  I have been inspired by photos on the wall with smiling faces for successful students.  Those who enroll with Edoofa must follow instructions  and be open minded. 

Student's must have vision of what the future must be not to think that Edoofa is a program of trying to get money in life  but they give scholarships and make education affordable through Learn While You Earn. They also make students understand how the scholarship program works, structure and policies involved because they can be duped by other people who pretend to help but taking money from poor people. 

Edoofa helps students in identifying good colleges and universities and why they are choosing them . They choose universities with results of endless hard work and also consider the resouces. There are a lot of requirements and appraisals for a student to qualify. They also look at accreditation, quality of teaching staff, infrastructure, accomodation and EWYL.

The last video explained the statement of purpose  which include the document for admission into Edoofa and recommendations. The student should convince the admission board why he has choosen and been offered the scholarship. Aform will be provided to fill all the details and the student must give best explanation 



The video also encouraged f
03/08/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding @263778067002  and @263776474974 .

I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Thank you
03/08/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
03/08/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Thank you so much we can continue
03/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

03/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. O-Level Results*

*2. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Right now or tomorrow.
03/08/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to fill the SOP and complete the tasks by tomorrow 09.00 PM?
03/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 806 7002: Okay sir. It be done accordingly.
03/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
04/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 806 7002: 2. Medical Laboratory Technology and is a healthcare brach that  branch that works on providing data by managing and performing laboratory testing. They work on tissues and body fluids like blood, urine and sputum. This brach is important because in each system of medicine, diagnosis of the diseases is a primary step because no treatment is possible without a proper diagnostic. By doing this it allows nurses and other health workers to take good and quality care on the patients. During the times of infection control and surveillance this branc helps us to find the pathogens and the treatment to the diseases which will make it easier for the cure of the disease and stop the spread. This will also reduce the length of stay of a patient in a hospital waiting for a disease to show its symptoms but rather they will identify the disease within a matter of hours and this will make treatment more quicker. Medical Laboratory Technology helps nusrses to the specific disease that they are going tomwork on hence this make ls treament faster and more flexible and they will not hesitate to give the patient the required treatment.
04/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 806 7002: Scope of practice involve the collection of specimens (infectious samples like blood, urine and stool) for various biochemical , pathological, microbiological hematological and blood bank. It involves to perform and validate various investigations for the purpose of differential diagnosis. There is also the maintanance of quality control for the reliability of laboratory reports.
04/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 806 7002: 2. Good Laboratory Practices refers to the methods that are accepted to carryout activities or operations in laboratory.  This refers to a quality system of management control for labaratories. The good practices involve not eating it the laboratory, use of proper storage materials, labelling your work space and stay focused away from your environment. It is important to follow thes GLP because it allows the laboratory technologist to functions at their best level free from errors for example they have to stay focused and free from their environment.  They should also not work alone and this helps them reduce mistakes and provide high quality results. Eating during laboratory work is one of the most dangerous thing because the viruse and diseases they work on my be transmitted into their bodies through the food they eat and this might affect the health of the worker. 
In order for the laboratory to be perfect the GLP must be followed and this lowers risks of unnecessary mistakes.
04/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 806 7002: The above answers are for question 3.
04/08/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 806 7002: 4. Sterilization is whereby all biological matter is destroyed. There are several methods of sterilization and some of these methods are as follows 
(i) autoclaving
(ii) dry heat
(iii) filtration 
(iv) solvent
(v) formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and chlorine dioxide. 

Solvents: this is one of the methods of sterilization. It is fast, easy and cost-effective way for laboratories to clean surfaces and some equipment. Ethanol is a popular disinfectant, with the capacity to deactivate lilophic viruses such as influenza, herpes and vacinnia at concentration of about 60% and 90% when diluted in water. The organic compound does these by breakinv down the fatty acid bilayer that encases a virus cell and destroying it in a matter of seconds.

Sterilization is important because it clears the environment away from infections for example influenza by ethanol. It ensures dieases free environment is obtained. It also save cost some of the materials are recycled after they have been recycled hence this reduces the cost of use of raw materials.  
Due to all these facts sterilization is an important aspect of life.
04/08/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 806 7002: 5. There are various techniques for placing samples under a microscope but i am going to talk about a few methods. 

We have the Whole Mounts method which is for small iterms like hairs, small insects or pollen grains. The sample is placed directly on the centre part of the glass or plastic microscope slide with a small amount of mounting medium, usually a synthetic or natural resin product for permanent slides. For temporary slides such as drop of pond containing microorganisms, water is mounting medium. 

Squashes and Smears: 
A simple way to prepare a thin sample is to squash or flatten a small piece of tissue under the cover slip. Often used in plant samples to see chromosomes, rapidly growing tissues such as root tips or anthers undergoing cell division are preserved in fixative, then stained to reveal chromosomes. Gentle pressure from the eraser end of a pencil centered over the cover-slipped sample forces the cells apart into a single layer. In smears , the sample is spread thinly across one slide using another slide as the spreader and the resultant smear is dried and stained.

Stained Tissue Sections: 
A more complicated suctioning procedure occurs when the structure and organization of a whole small organism or a tissue piece needs study. For most samples, first tissue is preserved and hardened and the water removed. Then the sample is embedded in a rigid medium such as wax or plastic and sliced. The sections are adhered onto microscope slides embedding medium removed and the tissue stained to different structures and cells.
04/08/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 806 7002: I have completed all the other questions.

04/08/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, thank you for letting me know that, can I anticipate that you will be able to share your result tomorrow by 12.00 pm?
04/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 806 7002: Ok sir i will submit.
04/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12.00 pm.
05/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 647 4974: Noted
05/08/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
05/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 647 4974: Noted also
05/08/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 647 4974: Yes we discussed
05/08/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 647 4974: Yes understood
05/08/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 647 4974: I have a question on this is it possible that this amount will be needed before we finish paying the remaining $150 that we are supposed to pay
05/08/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 647 4974: Yes understood
05/08/23, 10:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263776474974 let me help you understand, each and everything will be informed to you once your registration process starts since your year of intake is 2024, your registration process will start after August 2023, so please I would encourage you to be patient as this is just a brief of what your admission process holds and how the cost breakdown looks like, for your understanding.

I hope we are clear here?
05/08/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 806 7002: Now clear.
05/08/23, 10:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
05/08/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 647 4974: Yes clear
05/08/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
05/08/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 647 4974: Following
05/08/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
05/08/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 647 4974: It is now clear will start preparing for the $750 as soon as i finish paying the remaining $150
05/08/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
05/08/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 647 4974: Ok will do so

I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted
21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?

21/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Good to hear it lessons our burdens
21/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I liked that thank you for that program
21/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted
21/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes understood
21/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Understood it is divided just like when we paid $350
21/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: That will ease our pockets
21/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Provide more information
21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
21/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 647 4974: How many points are considered for a student to be elligible
21/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Ok noted
21/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes i understand
21/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope your query has been answered with the message above?
21/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes answered
21/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes
21/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 647 4974: He will work harder so as not to fall into that category
21/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is really good to know however, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Very clear
21/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of his interest in August 2024 itself.
21/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Clear
21/09/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted
21/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Well understood
21/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as Brendon's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Brendon is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes excited
21/09/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Good night thank so much
21/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night.
26/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Brendon!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
26/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
26/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Thank you i am also happy
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Brendon!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Sorry for late response i was busy . Yes i went through the letter we can discuss
27/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 647 4974: 1. $900
2. 4 years
3. $300
4. $750
27/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I have questions to ask after discussion
27/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Understood
27/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 647 4974: So this means if he want to stay at compus it means $900 tuition fee plus $2000 accomodation to make a total of $2900 per semester
27/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Am i correct
27/09/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please this is correct, and we will discuss more on this later on. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes together
27/09/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes clear
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Ok clear
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Clear
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I am residing in Mt Darwin
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Yes share
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I heard it is one of the best universities in India as reccomended by the parent and other students who are there
27/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that LPU is one of the partner universities of Edoofa, and we have shared Brendon's application with LPU as well.
27/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Ok i will be patient but my worry is the period of payment does it not lapse whilst still waiting for other universities  to respond or it can be adjusted
27/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
27/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 647 4974: I was not aware of the tranfer option
27/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
27/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Noted thank you
27/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Thank you so much for your patience
27/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 647 4974: So is this payment  due on 10October
27/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 647 4974: What about this question
27/09/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Coming to this query of yours, this statement means that once your A-Level results will be out, you would have to submit the same when you will arrive here in India before your registration will be done.
27/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Well noted
28/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Brendon!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, may I know if you still have any other queries that you would like to ask so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission process?
28/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 647 4974: Good morning everything is good
28/09/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 647 4974: Yes we can move on
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

28/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Is the school in the town or in rural areas

28/09/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you find the university appealing from the photos. Galgotias University is located in Greater Noida, which is a well-developed suburb of Delhi, India. It is not in a rural area; rather, it's situated in an urban environment.

Greater Noida is a part of the National Capital Region (NCR) of India and is known for its modern infrastructure and connectivity to Delhi and other major cities. The university campus is designed to provide a conducive learning environment and offers all the necessary facilities and amenities for students.
28/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 647 4974: Good to hear that
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
