20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
20/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

20/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 717 9272: How long does you need to pay for the registration fee
20/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 717 9272: So this fee is in-line with your first year fee or it is on its own
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern regarding the registration fee payment. Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. 

Regarding your concern with first year fees, you will get more clarity on this as we move forward with the admission journey. However, Let me share an insight with you that the registration fees is indeed included in your first year fees. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
