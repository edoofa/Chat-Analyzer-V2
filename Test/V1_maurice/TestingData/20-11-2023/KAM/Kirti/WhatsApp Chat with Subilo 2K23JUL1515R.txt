01/08/23, 1:16 pm - +260 96 5393861: Question 2
01/08/23, 1:17 pm - +260 96 5393861: Microorganisms, also known as microbes, are a diverse group of living organisms that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. They play crucial roles in various ecological processes, and their impact on human life and the environment is vast. Here are some of the different types of microorganisms:
- Bacteria: Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic organisms and the most abundant microorganisms on Earth. They exist in various shapes and forms and can be found in almost every habitat. While some bacteria cause diseases, many others are beneficial, aiding in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and even food production.
- Viruses: Viruses are tiny infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. They are responsible for numerous diseases in humans, animals, and plants. Despite their harmful nature, viruses also play a vital role in ecosystem dynamics and have contributed to the evolution of life.
- Fungi: Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms that include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. They play a critical role in decomposition, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients in ecosystems. Some fungi form beneficial associations with plant roots, promoting nutrient uptake.
- Protozoa: Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms, often found in aquatic environments. They are important consumers in food chains, controlling bacterial populations and serving as a food source for higher organisms.
- Archaea: Archaea are another group of prokaryotic microorganisms with unique molecular and biochemical characteristics. They can be found in extreme environments such as hot springs, deep-sea vents, and salt flats.
- Algae: Algae are diverse groups of eukaryotic microorganisms that can be found in aquatic environments. They are primary producers, utilizing photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.
- Helminths: Helminths are parasitic worms that can infect humans and animals. They include various types of roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes.
- Prions: Prions are unique infectious agents composed solely of protein. They cause various neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans.
These diverse microorganisms have a profound impact on our planet, shaping ecosystems, affecting human health, and contributing to the overall balance of life on Earth. Understanding their roles and interactions is essential for managing disease, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring a sustainable future.
01/08/23, 1:18 pm - +260 96 5393861: [31/07, 21:37] Honey: Question 3 types of bacteria
[31/07, 21:37] Honey: Bacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms, and they come in various shapes, sizes, and metabolic characteristics. Here are some different types of bacteria based on their shapes and metabolic traits:

Cocci (singular: coccus): These bacteria are spherical or oval-shaped. They can occur in chains (streptococci), pairs (diplococci), or clusters (staphylococci). Examples include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Bacilli (singular: bacillus): Bacilli are rod-shaped bacteria. They can be single cells or form chains. Examples include Escherichia coli (E. coli), Bacillus anthracis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
Spirilla (singular: spirillum): Spirilla are spiral-shaped bacteria with a rigid helical structure. They can move using flagella. Examples include Spirillum volutans and Helicobacter pylori.
Vibrios: Vibrios are comma-shaped bacteria with a single, polar flagellum. Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, is a notable example.
Filamentous bacteria: These bacteria form long filaments, often branching structures. An example is Actinobacteria, which includes the genus Streptomyces known for producing antibiotics.
Spirochetes: Spirochetes are spiral-shaped bacteria with flexible helical structures. They move using axial filaments (endoflagella). Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is a well-known spirochete.
Gram-positive bacteria: These bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall, which retains the crystal violet stain in the Gram stain test. Examples include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium botulinum.
Gram-negative bacteria: These bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer surrounded by an outer membrane. They do not retain the crystal violet stain but retain the counterstain (safranin) in the Gram stain test. Examples include Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
These are just a few examples of the diverse types of bacteria that inhabit our world. Each type has unique characteristics and plays essential roles in various ecosystems, from supporting nutrient cycling to influencing human health and disease. Understanding these bacteria is crucial for medical, environmental, and industrial applications.
01/08/23, 1:20 pm - +260 96 5393861: Question 4
 
The human body is composed of trillions of cells, each with specialized functions that contribute to overall health and functioning. Some of the key cell types in our body include:

Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes): Responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and transporting carbon dioxide back to the lungs for removal.
White Blood Cells (Leukocytes): Essential components of the immune system, they protect the body against infections and foreign invaders. There are several types of white blood cells, including:
a. Neutrophils: The most abundant white blood cells, they are the first responders to infection and play a crucial role in combating bacterial infections.
b. Lymphocytes: There are two main types of lymphocytes - B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that target specific pathogens, while T cells coordinate the immune response and directly attack infected cells.
c. Monocytes: They are responsible for engulfing and digesting foreign particles and cellular debris.
d. Eosinophils: Involved in combating parasitic infections and regulating allergic responses.
e. Basophils: Release substances like histamine during allergic reactions and inflammation.
Platelets (Thrombocytes): Important for blood clotting, preventing excessive bleeding when there is damage to blood vessels.
Regarding immunity, white blood cells, especially lymphocytes (B cells and T cells), play a crucial role. B cells produce antibodies that recognize and neutralize specific pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. T cells directly attack infected cells and coordinate the immune response. These cells work together to defend the body against infections, toxins, and abnormal cells.

Diseases can impact the immune system in various ways:

Infections: Pathogens can directly affect immune cells, leading to their destruction or dysfunction. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets and weakens certain types of white blood cells, impairing the immune system's ability to fight infections.
Autoimmune Diseases: In autoimmune disorders, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. This can result in inflammation, tissue damage, and impaired organ function.
Immunodeficiency Disorders: Certain diseases and conditions, such as genetic disorders or medical treatments like chemotherapy, can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections.
Allergies: In allergic reactions, the immune system overreacts to harmless substances, triggering an inflammatory response. Cells like basophils and eosinophils are involved in these responses.
01/08/23, 1:22 pm - +260 96 5393861: Medical practitioners sometimes prescribe antibiotics in cases of viral infections due to a few key reasons, although this practice is generally discouraged and increasingly becoming less common. Antibiotics are specifically designed to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections. The primary reasons for prescribing antibiotics in viral infection cases are:

Misdiagnosis: Viral and bacterial infections can have similar initial symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, and cough. In some cases, it can be challenging to distinguish between the two without further tests. To avoid missing bacterial infections that might require immediate antibiotic treatment, doctors may err on the side of caution and prescribe antibiotics.
Secondary Infections: Viral infections can weaken the immune system, making patients more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. In such cases, antibiotics may be prescribed to address any bacterial complications that arise alongside the viral infection.
Coinfections: In certain situations, both viral and bacterial infections can coexist in a patient. Diagnosing such coinfections can be tricky, and antibiotics might be prescribed to cover potential bacterial involvement.
Patient Expectations: Patients often visit doctors with the expectation of receiving a prescription, and some may insist on antibiotics, believing they are a cure-all for any infection. To satisfy patient demands, doctors might prescribe antibiotics even in viral cases, even though they may not be necessary or effective.
However, indiscriminate use of antibiotics can lead to several significant problems, including:

a. Antibiotic Resistance: Overusing antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These resistant strains pose a serious threat to public health, as infections become more challenging to treat.

b. Side Effects: Antibiotics can cause various side effects, including allergic reactions, digestive disturbances, and disruption of the body's natural microbial balance.

c. Disruption of Microbiome: Antibiotics can negatively impact the gut microbiome, which plays a crucial role in digestion, immunity, and overall health.

To address these issues, medical professionals are increasingly adopting a more cautious approach when prescribing antibiotics, aiming to limit their use to cases where bacterial infections are confirmed or strongly suspected. Proper diagnostic tests and evaluation are essential to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections accurately. Patients are also encouraged to follow their healthcare providers' recommendations and not insist on antibiotics for viral infections. By using antibiotics judiciously, we can help preserve their effectiveness and protect public health.

 Question 5
01/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions may I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
01/08/23, 1:49 pm - +260 97 7393869: By Friday that will be end of term results

08/08/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/08/23, 11:10 am - +260 96 5393861: <Media omitted>
09/08/23, 11:10 am - +260 96 5393861: <Media omitted>
09/08/23, 11:11 am - +260 96 5393861: Find documents attached🖕
09/08/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Subilo.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/08/23, 1:21 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes we can connect
09/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
09/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
09/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Science, in Microbiology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
09/08/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 5393861: Correct
09/08/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
09/08/23, 3:29 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes
09/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
09/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
09/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/08/23, 3:38 pm - +260 96 5393861: Following
09/08/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
09/08/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
09/08/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
09/08/23, 4:02 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes
09/08/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
09/08/23, 4:04 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes
09/08/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
09/08/23, 4:10 pm - +260 96 5393861: Following
09/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
09/08/23, 4:25 pm - +260 96 5393861: Following
09/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
09/08/23, 5:01 pm - +260 96 5393861: So far so good
09/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
11/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Subilo.

Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 9:56 pm - +260 96 5393861: Noted
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level/ Grade 12 Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - +260 96 5393861: Benefits reviewed.
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Subilo, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 10:28 pm - +260 96 5393861: Noted
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:31 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes it does
20/10/23, 10:32 pm - +260 96 5393861: How will that be possible?
20/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain. *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:34 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes it does.
20/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/10/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 5:30 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning, I will be available thanks.
21/10/23, 8:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Subilo,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 8:54 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning, Available yes
21/10/23, 8:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
21/10/23, 8:57 am - +260 96 5393861: Understood
21/10/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 8:59 am - +260 96 5393861: Need more information
21/10/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
21/10/23, 9:28 am - +260 96 5393861: Clear now
21/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/10/23, 9:37 am - +260 96 5393861: Noted
21/10/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/10/23, 10:18 am - +260 96 5393861: Yes agreed as the available options.
21/10/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/10/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/10/23, 11:34 am - +260 96 5393861: In an event that her final examination results will be ready by FEBRUARY 2024. What do we make of this?
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: yes, please as mentioned above, if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. If the results are not favourable she can reappear in her grade 12 and arrive in India in 2025.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/10/23, 11:45 am - +260 96 5393861: Not very clear, if she proceeds with diploma then the results assessment proves otherwise would she need to start all over in her barchester's journey or it will be a continuation from there?
21/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: No, please, let me help you explain, the second benefit here we give is that if a student does not wish to reappear in A- level, they can proceed with a diploma course, a diploma is an equivalent course so when a student is done with a diploma they can directly move ahead with a bachelors degree with the diploma grades.
21/10/23, 11:57 am - +260 96 5393861: If the duration for a diploma is 3 years, if she proceeds to barchester's she will do another 3 years making it 6 years in total. Is that the case?
21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
21/10/23, 12:00 pm - +260 96 5393861: Ok noted
21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 12:01 pm - +260 96 5393861: Understood
21/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes it is well understood.
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Subilo's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that subilo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 12:19 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes please
21/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/10/23, 1:02 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well noted
14/11/23, 11:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Subilo,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

15/11/23, 8:14 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning and thank you for the update. At 6PM I will be ready for the discussion.
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Subilo,

I hope you are doing well. I am happy that you were able to acknowledge the offer letter, that is alright please I am looking forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm today.
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - +260 96 5393861: We will be ready
15/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - +260 96 5393861: Good evening thank you for reaching out to us at this hour.
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 7:05 pm - +260 96 5393861: Apologies for the un anticipated break, I had a challenge with power.
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - +260 96 5393861: - Tuition fee will be 900$ after the 50% scholarship per semester 
- the offer is valid for 15 and are required to pay the admission fees in that stated period 
- the registration fee is at 750$ and is non refundable 
- later issue an admission and procedure fee at 300$ 
- accommodation in hostel varies at 2000/2500 per annum  at has to be paid in full at time of reporting
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +260 96 5393861: While the full tuition fee is $1800/semester
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes it does
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well noted. But I need to be cleared, What determines the scholarship offer?
15/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, the scholarship is determined by the student's extremely great merits in their grades 12 and 10, co-curricular actives, the SOP of the student, and Edoofa's recommendation too. I hope we are clear here?
15/11/23, 8:32 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes, cleared
15/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well clarified
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes Proceed
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:46 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes please
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well noted
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - +260 96 5393861: Not Zimbabwe but Zambia
15/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - +260 96 5393861: Will explore it
15/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, kindly do the same. If you and your parents wish to use the same mode of payment as before, you can do that as well. Let me reshare the account details with you once -
15/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda
*Sort Code* - 090122
*Swift Code* - INZAZMLX
16/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Subilo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:42 pm - +260 96 5393861: Didn't realise that the  message needed a response thought it was the account numbers shared. apologies
16/11/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please may I know if you have taken note of the above details?
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes please
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +260 96 5393861: Following
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +260 96 5393861: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - +260 96 5393861: Correct
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - +260 96 5393861: Sending a child abroad to study is not an easy undertaking, anything across the border is costly due to the involvement of exchange fluctuation rates of the foreign currencies. Hence sending my daughter abroad on a 50% scholarship will somehow be  challenge to us back home. Despite the edoofer program being in place the strain will still be there. We looked at the initial proposed scholarship offer of 90% could at least help.
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - +260 96 5393861: In view of the aforesaid, since the measure was on the grade 10 results, can't we wait for the final Grade 12 results in order for the admission team to re-evaluate the scholarship offer as 50% would be costly to us to manage?
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - +260 96 5393861: 🙏
17/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Subilo.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 12:50 pm - +260 96 5393861: Good afternoon, available yes
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
17/11/23, 9:47 pm - +260 96 5393861: 🙏🙏
18/11/23, 8:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Subilo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your queries and discuss the letter in detail?
18/11/23, 8:09 am - +260 96 5393861: Good morning thanks. Yes we are available
18/11/23, 8:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now coming to your concern from the other day, you know I spent my day with your counselor and I was even going through your counseling session, could you please help me understand your thoughts on how were you initially proposed to a 90% scholarship just to understand you better so that I can provide you a better clarity?
18/11/23, 10:38 am - +260 96 5393861: Sorry for the delayed response, I will be getting back to you soon
18/11/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I shall wait for your response.
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +260 96 5393861: Good day once again, in our earlier submission and assessment for the acceptance onto the edoofa program, that's where they were advised how much scholarship you would gain. I could have missed the point that each university would give its own scholarship based on their assessment. I stand to be corrected?
18/11/23, 12:12 pm - +260 96 5393861: In addition, Are we expecting many more other offers from different universities with different percentages or its just one?
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand the confusion that you must have had however, I believe that now we are on the same page each university has its own metrics based on which the scholarship quantum is evaluated to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their garde12, and 10 results, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 1:09 pm - +260 96 5393861: Well explained and clearly understood. Like I earlier on stated, while waiting for other university responses and the girl obtains her final grade 12 results, will there be room to resubmit the application based on the latest results for consideration?
18/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias , you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias  and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/11/23, 1:33 pm - +260 96 5393861: Not preview to that information.
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/11/23, 1:35 pm - +260 96 5393861: I do understand
18/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your second concern if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E/45% pasing grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
18/11/23, 1:55 pm - +260 96 5393861: Very clear
18/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - +260 96 5393861: Still digression the information given. Whenever I need clarification I'll still ask.
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 5393861: Still digressing the information given. Whenever I need clarification I'll still ask.
18/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University.
