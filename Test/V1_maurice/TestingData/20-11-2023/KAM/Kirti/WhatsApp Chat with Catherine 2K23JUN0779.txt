I hope you are doing well, and had a fruitful weekend. For the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end and this prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.

 May I please know the underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing?

I hope you are doing well, and had a fruitful weekend. For the past few weeks, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end and this prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application as the academic board itself is present in the group.

 Could you please help me understand the reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us with the challenges you're facing? @263773031875 @263713184079 ?
