I hope you don't have any problem with it.


Your sessions will happen from *01:30 - 02:30 PM* from Monday to Friday.

Please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resume our sessions.
Am I so excited, hope you are too💯
01/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 590 5556: It is ok
01/11/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hope to see you today in the session!
01/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session✨
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Yes
01/11/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 590 5556: I'm also looking forward to it
01/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
01/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Walentine, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 590 5556: My long term goal is to find a stable profession in the engineering field and gather experience as I move forward. After I have gained adequate skills and knowledge from abroud, I would like to create my own company in my home country and creating employment for my people while securing the future of my family.
01/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so elated to hear that, and I am here to support you in all the ways and assist you to achieve all your dreams👏🏼
01/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
01/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Earning points which will assist my family's financial burden
01/11/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
01/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
01/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
01/11/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
01/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Thank you for your guidance
07/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Afternoon
07/11/23, 1:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
07/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Yes
07/11/23, 1:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Ok thank for the guidance which shall be given to me in this program
07/11/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You are always welcome!
07/11/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
07/11/23, 1:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
07/11/23, 1:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 590 5556: I have viewed the video Ms Saloni it is a pleasure to be guided by someone who is enthusiastic about the mentorship
07/11/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much, I feel so pumped and elated to hear this🌟
07/11/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
07/11/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
07/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Very much so
07/11/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
07/11/23, 4:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 590 5556: I've read the document
07/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you liked the best from the newsletter?
07/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 590 5556: The part about Henry Ford and how ge quit his job to pursue his dreams. This teaches is to take risks even when it may seem like we may fail. This drives one to be hungry for knowledge and ways to reach our desired destinations, resulting in a success story of our lives
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Afternoon sorry for the delay we may begin
08/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, I am happy to hear that it added to your interest🌟
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Walentine?
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 590 5556: It sounds great
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
