Are you ready for the session?
14/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 295 0153: Morning
14/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 295 0153: Yes I am ready
14/11/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
14/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 295 0153: Well noted
14/11/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
14/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 295 0153: My long term goals,are pursuing more eduction till l achieve my dreams and hel ping the needy when I have passed
14/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic mindset, and it's truly commendable that you're taking proactive steps toward becoming an independent and self-driven individual.
14/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 295 0153: EWYL will help me by teaching me what is need for me to achieve my dreams
14/11/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's correct!
14/11/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 295 0153: No
14/11/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/11/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 295 0153: I understand now
14/11/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 295 0153: Happy to hear about the team, how a you  Mrs,Sanjana and Ms,Davi
14/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, they are good and currently engaged in a meeting and they will surely connect with you soon.
14/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 295 0153: Ok
14/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 295 0153: So intresting
14/11/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

15/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
