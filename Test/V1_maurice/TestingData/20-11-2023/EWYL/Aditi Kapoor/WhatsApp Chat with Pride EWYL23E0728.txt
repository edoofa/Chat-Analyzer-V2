10/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good afternoon to you, am ready for today's session
10/10/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
10/10/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Dear Parent,
It is wonderful to have you back. Before we start the session could you briefly walk us through the two core objectives of the EWYL program?
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Program aim to have students who should be teachable and open minded 
2.students should follow instructions
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Pride* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
10/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well explained  and been refreshed am following  and jotting down my notes, we may  go ahead
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Pride's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for her application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback from her counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of her application, particularly her desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Sorry my network is talking time to download  the vedio but am still in
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, ma'am no issues, you can let me know when you would have watched it. <This message was edited>

12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes quality education equal joi opportunities
12/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Kudzai* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
12/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees.

12/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well understood, learning and earning to sustain or fund the same
12/10/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I would like to observe their presence with great appreciation, thank you
12/10/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for expressing your appreciation. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Pride* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
12/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I do understand the mandate ma'am   , Pride is at school school and it will be difficult for her to connect.They are currently rounding up revisions at school.l stand to be guided
12/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand!
12/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Pride* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

13/10/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Pride*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Pride* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
13/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following madam and l like the opportunities to finance self that great
13/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
13/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Pride* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
13/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Pride has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following you may proceed
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
