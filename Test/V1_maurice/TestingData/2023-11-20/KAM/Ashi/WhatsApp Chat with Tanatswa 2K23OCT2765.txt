20/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
20/11/23, 12:43 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes they're all clear sir
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Following sir
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
20/11/23, 12:59 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Oky the University fee will be paid in a period of how long and why is it in a range of $500-$1000?
20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27625569098 I can understand your concern regarding the registration fee payment. Let me inform you that we will talk about the registration process in our upcoming session. However, Let me share some insight with you that help you understand better that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. 

Regarding the registration fees range, I hope your counselor must have shared the same with you during your counseling sessions as this is the registration fees which is paid in order to reserve your scholarship seat. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Thank you for your clarification sir.we can continue.

20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
20/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes I've learnt a lot things that is student must be open minded and must follow all Edoofa's instructions

Secondly Edoofa's vision is not just to provide affordable and quality education and making students employable through SEELS but to increase the student's capacity hence making them more responsible and independent

Thirdly I've learnt about the Edoofa's triangle that's attitude, skills and knowledge this means that a guy who has right attitude, right skills and right knowledge will have a brain value of his own which will equip him with better job opportunities in the future

Lastly SOP that's statement of purpose is issued after educational documents have been submitted and recommendations have been made by the Edoofa's counseling team. SOP must convince every school why you deserve to be there and one must spend 1 hour on admission scheme form
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263787913093, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir l totally agree and thanks for shading more information about these videos

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/11/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.
