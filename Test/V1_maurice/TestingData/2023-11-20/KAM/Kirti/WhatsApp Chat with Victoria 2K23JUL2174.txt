01/08/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Victoria.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was attending a meeting, thank you for sharing the forms, sure, a passport-size picture of Victoria is to be pasted on the form, may I know by when will you be able to update the counseling feedback form and share again?
01/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, I did go through your counseling feedback form, and I noticed that on page 2 of the form, the question 6(a) does not match with the feedback form I shared with you, could you please help me understand that?
01/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Ms Kirti our apologies please we are a bit tide up at the moment, something just came up.
01/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand. Please take your time and I shall wait for you response before 11.00 PM.
01/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Tomorrow hopefully
01/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 12.30 PM. I hope you will be available.
01/08/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 233 2464: So sorry about the delay. Is it OK if we continue.
01/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Yes, we can.
01/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Sorry, maybe we missed the feedback form you are talking about.
01/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 233 2464: We answered question 6 a. Based this information we discussed with counsellors.
01/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Maybe we misunderstood the question.
01/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I would like to brief you the cost of education after the scholarship which I shared with you in the counseling session was for courses such as BSc Cardiovascular, BSc Optometry and BSc Biotechnology, you see, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Pharmacy* itself is a course which fewer scholarships seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
01/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 233 2464: 👆 We have received this one and we answered 'yes' to acknowledge it.
01/08/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me @263772332464, I belive you did have a conversation with Mr. Piyush, may I know if you are clear now about the cost?
01/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes please, we are clear hence answered YES on 6 a.
01/08/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know when can you update the form with the same and share the form again with us?
01/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Kindly clarify Ms Kirti, may be we are missing each other
01/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, may I please suggest you refer to the acceptance letter that was shared with you?
01/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Oh, ok thanks
01/08/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I see where the problem was.
Yes you can rectify.
01/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: So should we adjust the figures on top of the 2000-3000
01/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since printing the form again will be a challenge for you, so you can change the figures to 2700- 3700 and then right your acknowledgment as Yes.
01/08/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Ok, thanks
01/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
01/08/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I get you now.
01/08/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 715 2664: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thandeka's potrait
02/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Understood
02/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 233 2464: After how long is this step likely to occur?
02/08/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772332464, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
02/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes please
02/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes please
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Ok
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 233 2464: In 1hour time.
02/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
02/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
02/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes we are.
We have gone through the videos but had to repeat again and again bcoz of accent.
02/08/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail?
02/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 233 2464: In a nutshell, i got to comprehend the quality of education that will be rendered to our kids through a selection of good universities. I also heard the emphasis of capacity building and important of skills that will be transferred through work and learn program and not solely admiring reduced education costs.
02/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 715 2664: The co Founders explain how their  10 years of experience has enabled them to put systems in place so that the Edoofa deliver the best education to the learners. Their experience has earned them credit and have managed to create a network of highly accredited colleges in India. 
There is an emphasis of the SOP, it's importance in terms of convincing admission board why it should consider your application. The application form should completed with diligence and efficacy.
02/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
02/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
02/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
02/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Well summerised
02/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*

02/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you
02/08/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
02/08/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

04/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Question 1
04/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I did not understand you well here, could you please help me understand your query better?
04/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Question 2.

A good pharmacist is one who has a big heart. A pharmacist should be able to effectively, diligently and efficiently help patients, by putting their needs first. A pharmacist has to be good at communicating, so that they are able to enlighten the paitent on the  use, administration nd effects of the medication. A pharmacist also has to be a good listener. This enables them to help know what the patient requires.  A good pharmacist is clean, smart presentable and is also a team player, able to work well with other people while offering the patient or clients comfort and hope that they will get better soon.

I am good at concentrating, listening nd l have a good memory. I am physically active and l have good communication skills. I will be able to listen to the ailments clients may bring forward hence offering them the correct medicines..
Having good memory will ensure that l do not mix up the many different medicines, in their correct doses. I am able to run around, sweat and work long hours. I am also very passionate about pharmacy. To me it is more than just a career, but it's an opportunity to change people's lives while simultaneously doing what l love which is giving back to the community and working for the community. I am presentable and l know the need to keep a clean front.
04/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 621 9940: I drafted the answers offline with the use of screenshots. My challenge is network. I am failing to paste them onto the online form. I am kindly calling for help.
04/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, @263776219940 Please try accessing the link at midnight, since the network is strong at that time and you can share the screenshot by tomorrow 10.00 am.
04/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Question 3

Technology can be used to keep record of the different medications available, those that have been sold, those in current stock  and for statistical purposes such as knowing which medication is on demand. Keeping such records with the use of technology is more suitable as it can be easily accessed and accurately calculated using the current apps. It can be kept on cloud storage hence it can not be affected by weather, stolen or even get torn.

It can be used to record the different uses of medicines and the amounts in which they can be delivered to the client, hence one can constantly check up on these facts, and enhance their memory.

Technology can be used for efficient communication. Some clients may not be physically present physically hence technology enables this and their requirements delivered to them.

Technology allows few pharmacists to share their work nd update each other on current affairs.

As a pharmacist it would help me be updated with the new medications in the industry and know which suppliers to buy from if l succeed in owning a pharmacy as l wish and to keep up with the changing market requirements.
04/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Question 4.

Pharmacists ensure the smooth sailing of the healthcare sector although in the background. While doctors and nurses have to diagnose nd prescribe medication for severe ailments, pharmacists assist with handling the medication and explaining it's use to the paitents. At a pharmacy, they can suggest possible medications or solutions for minor illnesses such as frost bites, itchiness, headaches and even chicken pox which can be addressed by over the counter treatment.
This route is also cheaper for those who require over the counter medication as hospitals nd clinics charge a certain fee to patients exclusive of the treatment, while directly approaching a pharmacist catalyses this route nd cuts costs. This also eases the pressure of other medical facilitators

Pharmacists are knowledgeable and well versed in medications nd their effect to the body and their side effects. This allows them to be able to advise clients on the best medication which will effectively settle all their ailments while simultaneously preventing the client from getting unwanted symptoms in the process.

Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent some types of bacterial infection. They kill bacteria or prevent them from reproducing and spreading. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. This includes the common cold, flu, most coughs and sore throats.
Antiviral medications help the body fight off harmful viruses. The drugs can ease symptoms and shorten the length of a viral infection. Antibiotics are medications that help the immune system fight infections caused by bacteria. Antivirals are medications that help the immune system fight infections caused by viruses. Bacteria and viruses are structurally different hence need to handled differently containing different chemicals and conditions.
05/08/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 233 2464: Good morning. Thanks
05/08/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/08/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Pharmacy, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/08/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 715 2664: Yes, it's true Ms Kirti, but if there could be an earlier intake than August 2024 that would be very much appreciated.
05/08/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the query, however, let me inform you that the academic session in India commences in the month of August only, so an early intake will not be possible.
05/08/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Well understood Ms Kirti, infact it was just a gentle enquiry not necessarily a query. I'm sure we are good to proceed to the third step.
05/08/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes we ready
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Its not possible
05/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
05/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
05/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
05/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes he did
05/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2700-$3700 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
05/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Great
05/08/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks.
05/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.
05/08/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
05/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Clear
05/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
05/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 715 2664: So usually the universities  will present their fee structure less the scholarship contributions?
05/08/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263777152664 please note that each and everything will be informed to you once your registration process starts since your year of intake is 2024, your registration process will start after August 2023, so please I would encourage you to be patient as this is just a brief of what your admission process holds and how the cost breakdown looks like, for your understanding.

I hope we are clear here?
05/08/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Clear
05/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 715 2664: So in a way there is no need to ask for any clarifications at the moment, noted thanks
05/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear here?
05/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood
05/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Let's proceed ma'am
08/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks.

We will hear from you.
08/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great day ahead!
08/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Thank you. Same with you

4. Registration fee will have to be made which may range between USD500 to USD 750.
21/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 715 2664: My understanding of the admission process

1. Edoofa will share scholarship applications with several universities

21/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 715 2664: We are good to go ma'am. Everything well comprehended
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 715 2664: These are exciting news.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
23/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Victoria,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Good after noon Ms Kirti. My apologies for not responding to you on time. Thandeka is busy with her exams. My wife and I are held up as well. In fact we are not allowed phones during work hours.
23/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand that @263777152664 in that case, we can connect during the evening discussion hours, when you and your wife will be available to connect?
25/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to connect with you today. May I know if you were able to go through the benefits above?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes i did.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Victoria, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Thank you i understand.
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: This is fantastic, thank you.
25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks.
25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood, thanks
25/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Waiting for this message
25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
25/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Crystal clear thanks for the explanation.
25/10/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes. Less than 6points is a fail.
25/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.
I hope Victoria will bring us nothing less than 6points
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure, she will bring more than that and make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yes, totally
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yessss
25/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 621 9940: So u re-apply for the Edoofa program if u want to continue to a bachelor degree after the diploma?
25/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please your diploma grades would be enough for you to start with your bachelor's degree.
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Oky, l understand
25/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Nooooo l dont
25/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Its clear.
25/10/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Victoria's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 52 students have already secured their seats, leaving 48 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Victoria is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Im delighted to proceed.
25/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks
15/11/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, MVN University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes i went through it thoroughly.
Took not that scholarship was 100% if it wasn't a typing error and that A'level results will determine her fate.
16/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Yes thanks. Im following.
16/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I have gone through the letter closely. Is the shortfall for all combined USD2250?
With 1000 paid as registration fee to be later deducted from total fees?
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, I would encourage you to response to the questions I mentioned above, please one by one and I will help you understand better as we move ahead.
16/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Ok.
1. Balance is USD 1000

2. Zero

3. Balance is USD 2250

4. Sport balance is USD 125

5. Admin processing fee USD 575.
16/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I believe there must be a clerical error by the university since your course chosen is a niche course the scholarship offered is 75%, please do not worry the team will update the error however your fee structure is right.
16/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Following
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
16/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thank you.
16/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 233 2464: May i ask about meals during the study period.
16/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you with the food here. The university will provide you with the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals and it will cost the students with monthly expenses of $40 to $50 to gather the groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university which give you the affordability and the convenience too. I hope I am clear on this ?
16/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Clear. Thanks
16/11/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Victoria's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 621 9940: I have gone through it
16/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Victoria's total annual education cost as $2500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Very clear
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted, thank you very much.
16/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Victoria.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Good afternoon ma'am
17/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Everyone was at wrk
17/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know if you are available to connect with us?
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Good day.
We are well thanks and yourself?
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Im available now.
17/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Yes
17/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Its clear, thanks
17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Very beneficial.
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Understood.
17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,700 to $3,700 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2700 to $3700).
17/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
17/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: True.
It reduces the burden
17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Victoria is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
17/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
17/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 233 2464: I would rather save 850 annually.
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $2,500 - $1,000 = $1500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted.
17/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 29th, 2023*.
17/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Victoria through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Please explain.

And would also like to understand what happens after paying and she doesn't meet the admission criteria.
17/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 29, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 29, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 29, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772332464 she has already met the admission criteria and that is why the university has offered her a scholarship, please.
17/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted, thanks.
17/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 233 2464: 🥰 Ok thank you.
17/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 233 2464: We stay in Bulawayo.
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Noted, thank you.
17/11/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter.

17/11/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 11:02 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Not any at the moment.

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVNUniversity as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Afternoon
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 621 9940: I hope u are well
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, i am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 621 9940: I am available.
But my parents are not arnd
20/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I am sure you can let us know if your were able to have a discussion about your offer letter as a family?
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 621 9940: Not quite, we cldnt reach an agreement.......

At heart my first option is medicine, nd l was clearly told l won't be able to pursue it in India, pharmacy is my 2nd option......

Paying wld mean am tied down to pharmacy evn if l qualify for medicine....

Am caught between...
The results are uncertain at this point, but most importantly l do not want to live with regrets...

I am hoping there is another way we can go abt this because it is an August intake after all, we have a few months before then
20/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Victoria, I completely understand the complexities you're facing in making this decision. It's not uncommon for students to have a strong preference for a specific field, especially in the medical domain. The pursuit of a medical degree is undoubtedly a significant goal, and I appreciate your commitment to it.

In India, the structure of the education system and the specific requirements for medical studies pose challenges for you, and hence, pharmacy is the more feasible option. While it might seem like a compromise, pharmacy is a valuable field with its own merits and opportunities.
20/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Vividly remember being in a similar situation when I was about to begin my bachelor's education, so I genuinely empathize with your current situation.

Reflecting on my own experience, I recall my mother offering valuable advice during that time. She emphasized the importance of balancing our educational aspirations with the realistic opportunities available to us. When making decisions about higher education, it's crucial to consider career options rather than solely relying on personal preferences. Striking this balance ensures a promising future without missing out on valuable opportunities.
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, addressing the specific dilemma you mentioned regarding medicine and pharmacy, it is essential to recognize the constraints posed by your high school subject combination and the education system in India. Hence, I am a bit confused as well, you mentioned that you will be eligible for medicine, but due to the structure of the Indian education system, pursuing medicine directly is not an available option. Can you help me over here?
20/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Good day.
Im sorry im help up for the next 2hours im at a training session.

I just came across your messages.

Thank you so much for remembering and reminding Thandeka what i said.
We all wish and aim higher.

Myself i wanted and still wish to become a medical officer but somethings remain in our dreams.

Life doesn't take us where we always want to go.
20/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Please ignore.
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 233 2464: ... Im held up.....
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please @263772332464 I understand that you must be held up with work, with regard to my conversation with Mr. Moyo over the personal window, we will be connecting tomorrow at 12:30 pm. Have a great day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 233 2464: Thank you.
20/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
