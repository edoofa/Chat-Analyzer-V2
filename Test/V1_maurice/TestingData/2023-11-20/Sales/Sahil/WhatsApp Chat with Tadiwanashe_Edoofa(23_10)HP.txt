31/10/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that please!

Currently she is a student at King Solomon commercial college, Mrs Bianca?
31/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 363 4475: Yes sir , its Private School in Harare, Borrowdale.
31/10/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

I am Ms Harmehak, Mrs Bianca
31/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 363 4475: Sorry ma'am, for calling you sir.My sincere apologies.
31/10/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: I understand please
31/10/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: May I know Tadiwanashe's term fee at King Solomon in USD and who supports her financially?
31/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 363 4475: Its $250USD /per term because she has a cousin who teaches there , hence the discount .But for other students the normal school fees is $500USD .
31/10/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
31/10/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
31/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 363 4475: Ok noted , so how does she apply for the scholarship?Is it a 100% covered scholarship?
She is writing next year June her Advanced  Level Examinations.
31/10/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
31/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 363 4475: Thank you for educating me Ms Harmehak.
31/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 363 4475: I have learnt a lot today.
31/10/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad please!
31/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 363 4475: So is my daughter eligible?
31/10/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: We are currently in the process for the same itself.
31/10/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Do you have access to her I level results currently?
31/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 363 4475: Let me talk to someone from the school.
31/10/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Sure please!

Meanwhile let me brief you about her desired course.
31/10/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

31/10/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Bianca 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
31/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 363 4475: No I dont have any idea at all .
31/10/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
31/10/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
31/10/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
31/10/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

31/10/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Hello Tadiwanashe, how are you doing today?
31/10/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation, Tadiwanashe and Mrs Bianca
31/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 363 4475: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Received please
31/10/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far?
31/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Yes I have.
31/10/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Bianca, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if Tadiwanashe is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1250-$1500*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
31/10/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same please?
31/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I am convinced Tadiwanashe will perform with a high passing grade and am really interested in this offer.
31/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 363 4475: So how many points are considered a high passing grade?
31/10/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: However we always encourage our students to give their best efforts
31/10/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
31/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Oh ok so in the meantime we wait for her final results or some processes  can start now?
31/10/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: The process is started now itself on provisional admission and she would start her Earn While You Learn journey too
31/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 363 4475: So what should we do now?
31/10/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are in the counseling session and I am now going to brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program!
31/10/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
31/10/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
31/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Thats a very good program .So when can she start ?
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: As soon as she is found eligible please.
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: She starts from Zimbabwe itself
31/10/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

31/10/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
31/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 363 4475: So you will let us know if she is eligible?
31/10/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

You would be going through proper interview for the same and would receive an acceptance letter if/when she is found eligible.
31/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Ok okay thank you very much .We will wait for the scheduled interview. Just let us know when.
31/10/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, meanwhile are you following the discussion regarding the Earn While You Learn Program too?
31/10/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

Are we connected, @263711467597 ?
31/10/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Kindly note that active participation is important from your end to be able to complete the discussion.*
01/11/23, 6:34 am - +263 71 146 7597: Yes I am connected
01/11/23, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
01/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 363 4475: Good morning. It Ms Bianca ..sorry I had lessons in the morning. I am now connected.
01/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 363 4475: My sincere apologies
01/11/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!
01/11/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Have you followed our yesterday's discussion?
01/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 363 4475: Yes I understood everything...Thank you
01/11/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: That is great, 

Mrs Bianca, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
01/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 363 4475: I am ready.
01/11/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Mrs Bianca, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
01/11/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 363 4475: $1250 if they apply to 5 universities.
01/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
01/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I can see that the Edoofa is truly trying to make it all affordable for us .
01/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
01/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 363 4475: So how do we pay the $350 for the Round 3 November  30 , 2023?
01/11/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: It's paid after Tadiwanashe is found eligible and is paid through online banking modes,

Everything is briefed in the acceptance letter.
01/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Noted I have understood clearly .So now we wait for Tadiwanashe's acceptance letter.
01/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: You would proceed for interview with the program director first!
01/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
01/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Yes Ma'am I have understood.
01/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
01/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
01/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Ok noted all the above.
01/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
01/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
01/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I will definitely get in touch with her Ma'am.Thank you so much for her contact.
01/11/23, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Mrs Bianca.
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 11 am CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

We do look forward to the same.
02/11/23, 11:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?

She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

04/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 363 4475: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 8th or 9th November 2023 for $200 and the 8th or 9th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 8th or 9th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
04/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I would prefer the first option I can take that one.
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes?

06/11/23, 5:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You have to do the interview now and reserve your child's seat this year and she will start her tertiary after she is done with A level but you have reserve seats now.
06/11/23, 5:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Sent
09/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Yes I did .
09/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Thank you
09/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me ?
09/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I wanted to know after paying the $350 what is the next step?
2)Visa processing...is there money paid by the parent?
3)Travelling arrangements does Edoofa take care of all of them?
09/11/23, 7:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$590, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
09/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Thank you so much for the detailed explanation.Now I reaĺly understand.
09/11/23, 7:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you connected with Mrs.Ruth ?
09/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Yes I am.
09/11/23, 8:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can call her to know more
09/11/23, 8:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about available payment modes in depth ?
09/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 363 4475: I was chatting with her today .I will call her tomorrow. Thank you so much.
09/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Yes please.
09/11/23, 8:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
09/11/23, 8:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

17/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 363 4475: Under the prevailing situation I dont have anything at the moment.
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tadiwanashe's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tadiwanshe's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
