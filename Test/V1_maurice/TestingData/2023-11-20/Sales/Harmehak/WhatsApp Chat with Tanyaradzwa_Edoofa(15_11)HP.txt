20/11/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tanyaradzwa.
20/11/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 309 9774: Yes Ms l am very confident that l will come with 10 or more points
20/11/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful

20/11/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: So Tanyaradzwa, what exactly would you like to pursue?
20/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 309 9774: Ms to be honest , on the application form l wrote social work but honestly l want to do political science . I am one of the world patriots who wants to serve nations till the last blood in my veins
20/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 309 9774: Plz Ms can yu plz help if l am choosing well
20/11/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Tanyaradzwa
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, 

Meanwhile, you mentioned you have siblings too, 

May I know more about them?
20/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 309 9774: Ok Ms my big brother  Munyaradzi  is 30 years and he is in the construction industry , my elder sister is Tafadzwa and she is a teacher , my other elder Sister is Taonaishe and she is in the first year at MSU university doing food science and l have two younger brothers , Takomborerwa and Tavongo and the other one grade 7 and other 3 respectively
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, it's a pleasure to know about them!

The course not just deals with modern political scenarios but also encompasses the history of political development, various political revolutions across the world, thus helping a student learn the Political practices of countries around the world.

After a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, a student has multiple academic options available in India. A student vying for higher studies can opt for an MA in Political Science which is a Master’s degree in Political Science. A student can also opt for an MA in International Relations.

Other than the traditional MA options, there is the option to pursue studies in Law. Students who wish to study law after graduation in political science have the option of 3 year LLB course which is offered to students after graduation in any stream.

The option to do an MBA is also open for students after BA in Political Science. In MBA too, there are multiple options like MBA in HRM, MBA in Marketing etc.

*Career Prospects*

The students have a lot of BA Political Science job opportunities once they complete this course. Some of the major job profiles are:

*Public Administrator*    
As a Public Administrator, BA Political Science graduates can utilize their knowledge to inform policy decisions and administer those decisions effectively.

*Academician*

A Political content writer’s job is to write about various contemporary and historical political issues majorly for online media outlets for news and information.

*Consultant*    
A political consultant is a professional who helps an organization make politically informed choices. Their knowledge about political philosophy comes in handy in such roles.

*Manager*
