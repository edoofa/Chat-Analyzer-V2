We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

20/11/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive,

So why didn't you proceed with your higher education after A level, Sharon?
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 253 9670: I needed mathematics and im waiting for the results currently,Mathematics was my barrier
20/11/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please,

20/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 253 9670: No ,i did not
20/11/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

Kindly share your results with me, Sharon.

20/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 253 9670: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Duly received
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Sharon, I can see you didn't manage to score as well in your A level, 

May I know more?
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 253 9670: Yes ,that was very unfortunate but what happened was I started with studying Zimsec for my A level and later on decided to switch schools and my former school offered Cambridge.I believe that became one of the reasons,switching from one board to the other despite what i may call me not being able to study to my best for better results .
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Sharon.

You happened to mention your desire to study Nursing, however you pursued arts in your A level,

Can you please help me understand regarding the same?
20/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 253 9670: My O level results only allowed me to study Arts in A level ,which i did but I desired nursing and I saw to it that I can get a degree in nursing with an A level but maths included.
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand your concerns, however science subjects like Biology, Chemistry are a mandatory requirement to pursue Nursing please.
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 253 9670: Noted ,thank you .
20/11/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that Mathematics along with Biology and Chemistry is a requirement even in Zimbabwe for medical fields, Sharon?
20/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 253 9670: In Zimbabwe,requirements for nursing are mathematics ,English and science but I have to admit I hadn’t paid attention that it is different when you need a degree.
20/11/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please.
20/11/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: You see, Sharon, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. 

So from our students and his personal experience, we happened to learn regarding the requirements there in Zimbabwe too.
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 253 9670: Sure ,I understand,I must have learnt only about the diploma then during my research,but thank you for the information.
20/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please Sharon!

So may I know what other fields are you intrigued towards?
20/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 71 253 9670: If you don’t mind me asking what I can qualify for with my results I would appreciate knowing
20/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

You can pursue -

What are your thoughts on the same?
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 253 9670: How about I sleep on it and definitely get back to you tomorrow?
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Sharon
20/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
