*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kudzaishe?*
16/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 543 8646: I saw that Edoofa is a good and different university compared to the universities that we have here in Zimbabwe. It has safe and welcoming environment and high quality education compared to our universities that we have in Zimbabwe. It also shows that Edoofa moulded the behaviour of the students as it stated that it involves parents and be punctual to schedule of your counsellor . I also understood that Edoofa has an affordablilty tuition and it offers high quality education than our universities that we have here . Edoofa offers both scholarship and Sponsorship but it only gives scholarships to the previledges but those who cannot afford Scholarship may get Sponsorship

I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Simeon

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
20/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 314 6326: Good morning. 

It's my pleasure having conversation with you.

Of recently I have heard that there is a scholarship program called Edoofa that is assisting students to study in India.
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Thank yu giving me more information about Edoofa. I'm now enlightened.
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

*United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Great news.
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Tru that. I'm a holder of Bachelor of Commerce Honors Degree in Finance from National University of Science and Technology 2013. I'm currently working as an Audit Clerk at Binga Rural District Council. .

Considering the current educational systems we are having in Zimbabwe, i would be very happy for Simeon to study abroad as he will be able to explore a lot into his career provided adequate resources are availed to him as we lack resources hence enhanced accademic experience.
Studying abroad will assist in making better decision as one will be having a seen HOW OTHERS ARE DOING THINGS  thus unlocking new greater possibilities that we are not realizing today in our community. 
Studing abroad will also enhance personal growth and gives an expanded cultural awareness.
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Simeon*, right?
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Indeed
20/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Simeon*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
