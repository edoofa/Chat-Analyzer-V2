That is great, I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. *28-08-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?

25/08/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I will see you on Monday Ropafadzo.
29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 707 6586: Thank you mam l hope you will enjoy the day with your loved ones

31/08/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Ropafadzo. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you.

31/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 707 6586: So the document is a guide for searching potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are prepared to help students. The companies must be student centred and and can be ed tech platforms
31/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 707 6586: The employment range of the country must no be big or too small. The companies must be financially stable. We can use Google, linked etc to look for the companies
31/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know what Ropafadzo, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 707 6586: I think option 2 will be good
28/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 707 6586: Hie l would like to Know if we are continuing with our session on Saturday

04/10/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So can you come to the sessions for the next five days so that I can complete the introduction part of the EWYL Program. If you will be very attentive then we will compleet our introduction in the next 3 days.
04/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 707 6586: Yes
04/10/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So last time we were discussing project 2 - Community Building. Do you remember?
04/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 707 6586: Yes
04/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 707 6586: You said On Community Building Students must reflect attributes of a super networker and a person with good persuasion skills . Students will understand the most critical aspect of developing an organization which is based on growing by creating a social impact.
04/10/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/10/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Definitely
04/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 707 6586: Okay

04/10/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.

04/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 707 6586: I must create a WhatsApp group and find suitable people to add in the group where people will be enlightened about cheap education in India and the main reason to form the group is that l can reach many people without using much energy
04/10/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Ropafadzo, I am impressed with your understanding.
04/10/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
04/10/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

The Edoofa program is a life changing program that give children the chance to enrol at better international universities on an affordable fee.

04/10/23, 10:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 707 6586: Yes
04/10/23, 10:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
04/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 707 6586: Okay
04/10/23, 10:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

09/10/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
09/10/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
