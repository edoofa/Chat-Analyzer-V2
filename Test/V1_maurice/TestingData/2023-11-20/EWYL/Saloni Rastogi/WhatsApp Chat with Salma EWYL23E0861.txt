02/11/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your participation as a parent would be highly valued, however, the sessions are primarily for Chiweshe Tawananyasha, and it is important that the student essentially attends the session.
02/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 888 7599: Okay noted
02/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 382 5282: Noted thank you.
02/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 382 5282: I will join you when not pressed at work
07/11/23, 1:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Joining us in this discussion  its my mother ,Margaret Lobo who is a teacher at a  primary school and my second brother called Tadiwanashe
07/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome them to the group, I am sure you will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
07/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Salma, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
07/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 888 7599: I have always wanted to be in the medical field and l wanted to be a medical doctor but my results didn't allow me to pursue that.I also wanted to try nursing but in my country its difficult to procure a place for nursing that's why l have chosen to apply with you.The EWYL program will benefit me and my parents but reducing the amount of money that l will be required to pay since I come from a very humble backyard where my parents are divorced
07/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, and I promise to help and assist you in building skills beyond academics on this journey🌟
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
07/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 888 7599: May you please enlighten me more
07/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
07/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay thank you so much
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay noted
07/11/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
07/11/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 888 7599: I watched the video and it had no problems at all

07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
07/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay thank you
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Good afternoon.Yes we can start
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 73 990 4241: Good day ? Yes we can
08/11/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you grasped about me from the video?
08/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 888 7599: You are caring and determined to help Edoofians like me to achieve my goals
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much for saying that.  I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Yes it is
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay noted
08/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 888 7599: I have read the document
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay thank you

17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Salma/Saloni/17NOV2023*
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 888 7599: Okay noted
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
