11/01/23, 1:43 pm - You were added
03/08/23, 11:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a lovely morning to you my dear student!
03/08/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 846 8319: Good afternoon
04/08/23, 12:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Tanyaradzwa*!

Please excuse me for the delay in my response. As many Edoofians are arriving in India, i got busy with the preparations going at the backend.
04/08/23, 12:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that your EWYL program has been put on hold. 
Can you kindly let me know *the reason* for the same?

I would appreciate it if you could share *when you* will you be able to resume our sessions?
 
I'm truly looking forward to *embarking* on this journey together, and your presence is *eagerly* anticipated.
04/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 846 8319: Afternoon how are you doing
04/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 846 8319: The schedule of my EWYL program was clashing with my school time table
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in reply. By the time you texted, i got busy in an urgent meeting.
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you?
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, thank you so much for informing.
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 7:00 am - +243 842 242 746: Hi morning hope you are well 
Option 1 the best time would be 2 to 3 pm
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. Thank you so much for confirming.
16/09/23, 11:09 am - +243 842 242 746: Welcome have a good day
17/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 846 8319 changed to +263 71 484 8242
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - +243 842 242 746: Hi we are well thank you
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - +243 842 242 746: Hope you are fine also
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes I am doing great.
Are you ready for the session?
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - +243 842 242 746: Yes we can proceed
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: - Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 9:35 am - +243 842 242 746: Hi good morning
22/09/23, 9:35 am - +243 842 242 746: Pls assist with the two key objectives
22/09/23, 9:36 am - +243 842 242 746: Information
22/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well
22/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: yes sure
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tanyaradzwa* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - +243 842 242 746: I am ok thank you
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me know once you are done?
22/09/23, 9:53 am - +243 842 242 746: Well appreciated
22/09/23, 9:55 am - +243 842 242 746: This is so encouraging and wonderful
22/09/23, 9:55 am - +243 842 242 746: 🙏🏽🙏🏽
22/09/23, 9:57 am - +243 842 242 746: Thank you for the introductions
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it is
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Tanyaradzwa* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tanyaradzwa* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 10:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Tanyaradzwa’S EWYL journey:
22/09/23, 10:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Tanyaradzwa* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 484 8242: Good morning

29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Tanyaradzwa* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
29/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 484 8242: Understood
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Tanyaradzwa* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.
19/10/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Tanyaradzwa and parents! @263775808554 @263714848242 @243842242746 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +243 842 242 746: She wants to know if it possible to change  the degree program she had selected
26/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since this is an admission related query, I would really appreciate it if you consult your admission group and admission officers regarding this.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
