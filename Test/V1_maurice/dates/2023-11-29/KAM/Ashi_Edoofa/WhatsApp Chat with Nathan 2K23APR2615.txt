26/09/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Okay
26/09/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 184 7809: You may proceed
26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
26/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes they are clear
26/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes
26/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
26/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 184 7809: You may share mam I had an afternoon lesson
26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
26/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

26/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

28/09/23, 4:02 am - +263 78 184 7809: Question 2 
Myopia is usually caused by a mismatch between the length of the eyeball and the second focusing power of the lens inside the eye. When this happens, the light from distant objects doesn't focus properly on the retina. The result is blurred vision.
It can be controlled by having less time on gadgets to avoid blue light and wearing sun glasses to avoid harmful UV light
28/09/23, 4:02 am - +263 78 184 7809: Question 3

LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) surgery is a medical procedure that can correct refractive errors, like nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. It improves vision and help people with glasses or contact lenses to see clearly . 
However, some people use it to look better without glasses.
 LASIK surgery can't be used to correct retinal defects. because it only reshapes the cornea. Retinal defects are located in the retina ,it  can improve vision by correcting refractive errors but it can't fix problems with the retina.
28/09/23, 4:02 am - +263 78 184 7809: Question 4
1. Wear sunglasses
2. Take frequent breaks when looking at screens for long periods of time.

4. Staying hydrated
28/09/23, 4:02 am - +263 78 184 7809: Question 5

- Refractive errors (such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism)
- Cataracts

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so we were unable to get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Afternoon

It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Nathan wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Optometry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Noted with thanks
29/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Yes,
29/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 326 0266: I think he might in  a lecture but will join shortly
29/09/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely alright, parents can also have discussions on behalf of the Student, so may I know if you are available to connect with us?
29/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Yes l am
29/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Though having meetings here and there
29/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
30/09/23, 10:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nathan.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the process?
30/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Good afternoon mam we are available we my move ahead
30/09/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
30/09/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
30/09/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
30/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
30/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes he has but I forgot the exact figure
30/09/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just *$2000 to $3000 per year*. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
30/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
30/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am I remember I only had a little confusion
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Understood
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Following
30/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 184 7809: No mam I've understood
30/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday Afternoon at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available. Wish you a good evening.
30/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Good ma'am, l was out of network zone just seeing yr msg now. My apologies fr that
30/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Same to you mam
30/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Following all discussions thank u
03/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nathan.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 326 0266: It's a good afternoon to u
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773260266 may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
03/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Yes we can
03/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Good afternoon mam
03/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 184 7809: We are now available
03/10/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to shared before we start with our discussion?
03/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 326 0266: For now l do not have any queries or concerns l have been following all tye sessions closely and are quite clear
03/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 184 7809: No queries all clear mam
03/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
03/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
03/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes we are looking forward for the offer letters thank you ma'am
03/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Most indebted
03/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
03/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
03/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
03/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
03/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am we can proceed
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Nathan, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
03/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Well noted ma'am
03/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
03/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
03/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
03/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600
03/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 184 7809: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
03/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
03/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
03/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 7, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 7, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 7, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
03/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 184 7809: No all understood mam
03/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
03/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Explain it mam
03/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
03/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
03/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes all clear now
03/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
03/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yesss
03/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yeah I agree with you
03/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
03/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
03/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 184 7809: But in Zimbabwe there are also June exams
03/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
03/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
04/10/23, 2:45 am - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am
05/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nathan.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence and not connecting with you, as I have been under the weather though I look forward to connecting with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes ma'am we are available

05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Okay understood
05/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 184 7809: All understood mam we may proceed
05/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing now as your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 184 7809: I'm really excited mam
05/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Q2)4 years  
Q3)$300
Q4) $750
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nathan!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
18/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Fine and hw are u
18/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Yes
18/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 326 0266: But hw does the earn as you work apply to tuition fees
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we will discuss that moving ahead during our conversation. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Evening
18/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Well understood you may proceed
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Following
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 184 7809: All clear
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 184 7809: Yes
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 29th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 7:56 am - +263 78 184 7809: Morning Yes all is clear
19/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nathan!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 184 7809: That's okay, will be available.
Thank you
19/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Noted with thanks. Will be available
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Nathan!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Evening ,how are you?
Network here is quite bad
19/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 326 0266: We can talk
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 12:25 am - +263 78 184 7809: Yes I reside in Harare
20/10/23, 12:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 12:25 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 12:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 12:28 am - +263 78 184 7809: Thank you
20/10/23, 12:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 7:47 am - +263 77 326 0266: Thank u l will be in touch with him shortly and make such arrangements
20/10/23, 7:48 am - +263 77 326 0266: Yes
20/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nathan!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Afternoon
20/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Nathan should be busy with exams
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. In his absence, we will proceed with the discussions. For now, can you please let me know if you are clear till here?
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 326 0266: This is clear ,sorry fr a late reply l was travelling   till this evening
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Is it possible if l.pay  of the registration in phases but within the 15  days period?
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear you can do that, however, there are only 9 days left before the deadline, in that case, do you think you would be able to do that?
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Oh my God will try the best . Do we count weekend days
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, since the deadline is on 29th October please. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Ok ,l will the best l will deposit something on Monday,then will work towards the rest between Tuesday and Friday next week
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Very clear and exciting
20/10/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 326 0266: This is clear as well . Hope Nathan will catch up as he may be in studies
20/10/23, 9:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Nathan should comment on this
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 326 0266: Not fr nw
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
21/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 184 7809: Good morning Sir

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 184 7809: No sir you may proceed
21/10/23, 9:42 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 184 7809: I haven't yet but I will definitely do the research because I really need to no more about it
21/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, dear, I would also advise you to do that please. As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 29th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
