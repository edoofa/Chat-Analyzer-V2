**Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*: In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
25/09/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*: Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
25/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*: Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
25/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
25/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Thànk you so much for informing me
25/09/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
25/09/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
25/09/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Question 2: What is the difference between magazines, newspapers and digital in terms of content of each media

In commencement , the difference between magazines, newspapers and digital in terms of each media is that magazines are usually published less frequently, maybe after a month or so .Magazines can also cover a range of topics including lifestyle, fashion of celebrities such as musicians actors and other current events based on sports , movie and music which are more of entertainment to readers unlike newspapers. Newspapers are typically printed daily or weekly , and tend to focus on more local and timely new stories that are at times more important than magazines as they inform people of important issues or matters of the society or county. Lastly digital news are usually online only and can be passed at any time of the day .These include websites, blogs and social media which are whatsapp, Instagram and Twitter. Digital provides news on a wide range of topics and can be updated more frequently than newspapers and magazines.






Question 3: What is the difference between journalism and studio television 

Firstly , The difference between journalism and studio television is in the view that journalism is the process of analyzing and presenting information about current  events, issues and other topics of public interests.Journalism also  focuses on news and current affairs and has an aim to inform and educate people which is very important .Journalism is  unscripted  and spontaneous  as it is not written but information can be recorded currently.Jounalism can involve a lot of time in gathering information. Jounalism can occur at any place be it indoors or outdoors unlike studio television . On the other hand, studio television is a television programme that is produced and broadcasted from a television studio. Studio television includes news, game shows, talkshows and other entertainment .The studio television is scripted and rehearsed .Studio television is cheap and easy to bring out .Lastly studio television is different from jounalism as it is controlled in a controlled environment .




Question 4:What is your understanding of journalism ethics 

In commencement Jounalism ethics refers to the moral and professional standards that journalist are expected to adhereto when gathering and reporting information. Certain ethics should guide jounalists when doing their job and following them makes one a good journalist. In addition, Jounalists should be truthful, they should not report information based on what they think but should be able to verify their accuracy by providing facts.Furthermore, Jounalists should be fair and present information in an unbiased manner or due to favouritism and bribery .Moreso,Jounalists should be transparency and be free from any conflict of interest and to be  accountable for their actions or mistakes. More over , Jounalists are to be respectful to privacy of individuals unless there is a compelling public interest in revealing information .Lastly ,Journalists should strive to credible and not mislead audience into knowing information which can make a journalist's credibility suffer .




Question 5:What are the qualities you need to be a journalist 

Firstly , for one to become a jounalist they should have strong research skills.One should be a person who is willing to gather information  tirelessly and wholeheartedly. In addition , one should be inquisitive to become a jounalist, a person should be always curious to know the why , how and when points.This leads to deeper understanding of issues and helps in reporting unique issues.

26/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Using her account
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - +27 84 466 8510: marynhepera@gmail.com I use this account .good afternoon
26/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I had to provide answers and asked her to submit using her account as I was out of data to do so
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Arts, in (Journalism and Mass Communication) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes ma'am it's correct
26/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 581 9684: That's great to know ma'am
26/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
26/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes ma'am I am
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes i do ma'am
26/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Thank you for making me understand
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes ma'am it is
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes we are Ms kirti
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes ma'am I have
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I understand ma'am
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I would like to know the amount that will be required on the visa procedures
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, I can assist you with that. The visa fee amounts to $83.
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Okay ma'am thank you so much
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 581 9684: We may proceed
26/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Okay ma'am thank you so much
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes it's clear ma'am
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Very clear as well
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I understand
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I have no questions ma'am, thank you
27/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood everything. As your guardian, I hope your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes ma'am I am very excited
27/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Ok ma'am thank you and stay blessed 😊
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you for your kind words.

29/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 581 9684: My parents are at work now so they won't be available for discussions I apologize but they have a few questions they have 



1 how much is the school fees per year and what does it include

2.THE  due date for the registration fee and can it be paid separately and with a separate period of how long
29/09/23, 1:19 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Good afternoon Mr Milan
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here Rutendo. Stay assured that I have taken a note of these queries and I will make sure to answer them further during our discussion. For now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 581 9684: 1 .900
2.3 years
3.300
4.750
29/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes sir  I am
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Wow okay
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes sir
29/09/23, 3:08 pm - +27 84 466 8510: What about 300 what is it for
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 3:32 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Sorry Mr Milan I'm Rutendo's mother I will be glad if you respond my question above about 300 dollars .thank you
29/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know which $300 are you talking about here please?
29/09/23, 3:35 pm - +27 84 466 8510: The one which is written  admission  and procedure fee on offer letter
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to that. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 3:37 pm - +27 84 466 8510: It's clear thank you
29/09/23, 3:39 pm - +27 84 466 8510: The other question I have is,do we have to pay  750  all at once or we pay in 2 installment.
29/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 4:03 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Clear thank you so much
29/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/09/23, 4:06 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I'm in southafrica Johannesburg
29/09/23, 4:09 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Can you please help me with the alternative  modes
29/09/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I believe you made the payment of your enrollment fee through Mama Money from South Africa, right?
29/09/23, 5:10 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Yes I used mama money
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rutendo!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. In that case, while making the payment of your registration fee, you can use the same mode as well. For that, once you are ready to make the payment, you can then let us know and then I will help you with the Mama Money Order for you to be able to make the payment please. I hope this is clear?
30/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 581 9684: How Are you sir
30/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please, thank you for asking. May I know if you are clear with this as well?
30/09/23, 10:54 am - +27 84 466 8510: Yes its clear thank you
30/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
30/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Okay
02/10/23, 1:46 pm - +27 62 060 2421: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rutendo!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 581 9684: How are you sir, yes I am
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes sir
03/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 581 9684: No sir I don't
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Can i earn more money than this
03/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Is it possible
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. The earnings of a student from the EWYL Program completely depend on their hardwork and consistency with the program and they can even cover their complete fee through that please. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I am sir thank yoy
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?
04/10/23, 7:01 am - +263 78 581 9684: Good mornìng sir , no I dont have any queries
05/10/23, 7:56 am - +27 84 466 8510: Mr Milan goodmorning. I'm Rutendo mom can I call you.i need  to talk to  you
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rutendo!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, please. You can call me now and then we can have a discussion.
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 581 9684: How are you sir
05/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please thank you for asking Mrs. Dadirai! Now, as per the discussion that we had over call, you can move ahead to make the payment of $150 by tomorrow and then would be adjusted towards Rutendo's registration fee. 

Moving ahead, you can then make sure to pay the $300 before this month's end and after that, half of it would be going to the balance enrollment and half of it towards the first part of the registration. Is that clear please?
05/10/23, 4:43 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Yes it's clear thank you
05/10/23, 8:06 pm - +27 84 466 8510: How much is $150 in Rands or Indian Rupees
06/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rutendo!

06/10/23, 1:09 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I'm paying using mama money
06/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, shall I get an order generated for you with the payment amount as $150 please?
06/10/23, 1:13 pm - +27 84 466 8510: <Media omitted>

06/10/23, 1:14 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I'm going to pay before 4pm
06/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Once you are done with the payment please let me know of that by sharing the receipt with me here.
