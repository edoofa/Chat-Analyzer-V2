12/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Zoleka,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Zoleka’s higher education?
12/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Good day. I am Zoleka's father. I am doing great and so is everyone else in the home. We attended the familiarisation meeting with the counsellors when they visited Harare. We have been making some savings to cater for any initial payment requirements towards enrolment. Have also been encouraging Zoleka to study hard and be ready for the next stage of the enrolment process once he finishes writing his exams in November.
12/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits. Indeed I am sure he will give his best in his upcoming exams. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

10/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 280 2476: This will be done in the week this week

I can perhaps send the rest of the other information serve for the results that be send seperately
10/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 280 2476: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 280 2476: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know if you are facing any challenges since the documents were asked a long time ago?
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Sent above;

- Statement of entry for examinations for 2023
- National Identification Number
- Birth Certificate 
- Recommendation letter
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 280 2476: The original result slip for O,levels is kept at the school

The school is yet to release it so are waiting for the result slip from the school
10/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, could you share the screenshot from the online protal?
10/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Noted, let me ask Zoleka for that. Will get back to you
10/10/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
10/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you
11/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes, I have
11/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is clear
11/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Clear
11/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 280 2476: All above understood
11/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 280 2476: So far it is clear. In the event of receiving multiple offers from different Universities, is there an option to change a University preference after you have chosen one?.
11/10/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we move ahead with our discussion each and every query of yours shall be covered step by step.
11/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is alright
11/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Noted
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I have, shall we proceed later on as I have to join up with the others in the bus en route home
11/10/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, we can connect at 08:00 pm today. I hope you will be available.
11/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Hopefully so barring poor wifinetwork
11/10/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, you can update us accordingly please.
11/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I will, still on my way home. We can perhaps do tomorrow
11/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you must be tired, however, if you are available the discussion would nearly take an hour of your time and nothing more.
12/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Good afternoon Was a bit tied up. Can we do for the next 30 minutes then we will try and wrap up later on today 8.30 pm
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update, however, I am a bit tied up with a meeting right now, so let us reconnect at our scheduled time at 08:00 pm. I hope you understand?
12/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you. We can do that
12/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Evening 

We can go ahead
12/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too, I am pleased to connect with you again. Yes please, let us move ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the benefits?
12/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Evening, yes i did
12/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Zoleka, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Great to hear
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 280 2476: A great package indeed
12/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is very clear
12/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 280 2476: So far all is well understood
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 280 2476: You can provide more information
12/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is clear now
12/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is well understand and it Zoleka's duty to do well beyond the minimum entry requirements
12/10/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I am sure he will make you proud, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Sure that would be the scenario

Zoleka is a he.  Many Zolekas are a she though.
12/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that, I have updated that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Very clear
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I am clear and how long is the Diploma
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Diploma is a 3- year course.
12/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Noted
12/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I seem to have network connectivity challenges
12/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Understood
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you're facing network connectivity challenges, and it's okay. Whenever you're ready and have a stable connection we can move ahead.
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 280 2476: So far all is clear
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Zoleka's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Zoleka is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Very excited 

Looking foward to that
12/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It was a pleasure interacting today

3. In the event that we allow the offer from Galgotius to pass by, will you search for another University  for us consider
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this, stay assured that I have taken note of all the queries that you have shared with me here and moving ahead during our conversation I will make sure to provide you with the clarity needed with the same. Moving ahead, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Wish you speedy recovery
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 280 2476: 1. 1800 before 50% discount

After discount $900 per semester

2. 5 year duration

3. $300 procedure fee

4. $750 registration fee
15/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the wish ☺️ <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 280 2476: It is clear
15/10/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Understood
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 280 2476: We are togethet
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes i have understood
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Understood
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:58 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Clear
15/10/23, 10:59 pm - +263 77 280 2476: May i please ask to srart tomorrow

18/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I am clear
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes in HARARE
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank You
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes you can
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Clear. Thank You
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Clear
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 280 2476: That is most welcome.

No questions for now.
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

18/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you for sharing
18/10/23, 9:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you

We will do so and revert
19/10/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zoleka!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
19/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes we have had the opportunity to discuss and we appreciate 

Earlier on had asked some questions regarding alternatives to choose from for which You had said you will check and give feedback
19/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Here they are as a recap
19/10/23, 8:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you for sharing
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Well understood now
19/10/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Not sure if i do. It seems not. You may have to share the information
19/10/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you. Understood
19/10/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Thank you. Understood
19/10/23, 9:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear about that right?
19/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Very clear
19/10/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, can you please let me know of this as well?
19/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Yes we spoke about it and Zoleka is happy about the University

It was only that he wanted to see various options

The mother too was happy about the offer and.is looking foward to taking Zokeka to the airport come departure time
19/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Various questions came apart from the school but about the Indian Culture, language etc

Whether the lessons will be conducted in English or a different language

Questions about the distance from College should Zoleka opt to stay off campus
20/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zoleka!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great that your family had an open discussion, and it's natural to have questions and concerns when preparing for such a significant step in Zoleka's academic journey. Let me address some of these questions:

Language: The medium of instruction at Galgotias University is primarily English, so Zoleka will have her classes conducted in English.

Indian Culture: India is a diverse and culturally rich country. Zoleka will have the opportunity to experience and learn about Indian culture during her stay. The university often organizes cultural events and activities, which can be a great way to immerse herself in the culture.
20/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding accommodation, I have good news for you. All the accommodation facilities recommended by Galgotias University are conveniently located within walking distance from the university campus. This makes it easy for students to commute to and from their classes without any hassle. It also ensures that students are close to the academic and extracurricular activities on campus. I hope you are clear with this, right?
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 280 2476: Good evening

Good to hear such . I am grateful
20/10/23, 9:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. May I know if you have any other queries please?
20/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 280 2476: For now it is clear
20/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 280 2476: I came across  an article that said that For Law it is ;

74  in India
767 in Asia
2450 in the world
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, what else did you got to know about it?
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 280 2476: That the fees are affordables

Courses are designed to suit industry needs 

That you will find good studentss in their area
20/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
