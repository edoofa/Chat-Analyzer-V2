2.          $0

3.           $1600

4.         $250


5.        $1000
 The above is the information on the offer letter
01/08/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Per annum tuition fee after the schoolarship is $350 ( point of correction)
01/08/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Then the annual fee is $1600
01/08/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
01/08/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Noted .Yes it becomes affordable to us
01/08/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
01/08/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
01/08/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Noted
01/08/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
01/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 350 6605: It is clear
01/08/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
01/08/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
01/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Very clear
01/08/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
 
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
01/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Yes if the child works hard it is indeed affordable
01/08/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850  - $1000 = $850. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
01/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 350 6605: I am clear with this.But l have a question there.We paid an amount of $750 on Saturday last week and it was the registration fee.So what is the difference between the registration fee and the admission and processing fee.Are we going to pay another 1000  on top of the 750 we paid earlier.Can you please clarify this
01/08/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is indeed a very good question. Now, when it comes to the registration fee, here in case of the offer letter from MVN University, it is termed as the admission and processing fee. 

Moving ahead, since you have already paid $75- towards Tiriwashe's registration earlier this week, now you only need to pay the balance that is remaining from the $1000, i.e. $250 in order to proceed with Tiriwashe's admission at MVN University. I hope this is clear?
01/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Ohk it's now clear
01/08/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the balance payment, you can make it through the same mode that you used earlier for making the payment of $750. Shall we discuss that again, or have you already kept a note of the same with yourself?
01/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Yes we will pay through Mr Jerera as usual
01/08/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
01/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Ohk.I have just one question as follows

Do the university provide bed linen / blankets to the students?
01/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 350 6605: And does the scholarship cover food for the students?
01/08/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here. Now, when it comes to bedding and blankets, the university does not provide that, however, beds are included in the accommodation. 

Moreover, when it comes to food, there are a couple of options. If you and your fellow students prefer self-cooking, where you'll have the freedom to cook your food as per your preference, the estimated cost would be around $35-40 per month.

On the other hand, if you choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, which provides you with prepared meals, the cost will be approximately $70-90 per month. It ultimately depends on your personal preference and convenience. I hope you are clear about that?
01/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Noted.So does this mean that the accomodation provided will be furnished with cooking utensils and stoves?
01/08/23, 4:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, in case of an on-campus meal plan, all the utensils and related things will be available in the hostel mess itself. However, when it comes to off-campus ones, the students would have to arrange their own.
01/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Ohk noted
01/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 350 6605: No more questions we can proceed with the discussion
01/08/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

05/08/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Noted.We will go over it
06/08/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiriwashe!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?

06/08/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Good evening
We are ready for the discussion
07/08/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiriwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/08/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the error, here, the discussion was meant to take place at 10.30 AM Please. Hence, may I know if we can move ahead with the same now?
07/08/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 350 6605: Morning
07/08/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 350 6605: Yes we can move. ahead now
07/08/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the offer letter from LPU by now?
07/08/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 350 6605: Yes we managed to go over it
07/08/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
07/08/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 350 6605: Noted.
Per semester tuition after schoolarship is 1225
Standard duration course is 5 years
Admission and processing fee is 200
Registration fee is 700
07/08/23, 10:57 am - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 5-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 10 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
07/08/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 350 6605: It's clear
07/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU - <This message was edited>
07/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
07/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
07/08/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 350 6605: Noted
07/08/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675. 

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
07/08/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
07/08/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 350 6605: Noted
07/08/23, 12:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
07/08/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 350 6605: It's very clear
07/08/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, Moving forward to the registration fee -

The registration fee which we discussed earlier is $700 for LPU, and your admission processing fee is $200, which is one-time payable. To reserve a scholarship seat with the university one has to pay $700 in total and if you see your offer letter. Now, since you have already paid the admission fee earlier for MVN University, you do not need to pay it again for LPU. Instead, if you wish to process your admission and confirm it at LPU, then the fee that you had paid for MVN University will be adjusted for LPU and your admission will be shifted accordingly. I hope this is clear?
07/08/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 350 6605: From our assessment of the tuition and accomodation fees at LPU.It is very expensive and not affordable to us since the tuition per semester is high as compared to MVN.In addition MVN gave us a 100 % on accomodation.Therefore we prefer our child to go at MVN university
07/08/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, may I know if you have finalized that Tiriwashe will go to MVN University please?
07/08/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Yes he will go to MVN university
07/08/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Let me share the same update with the university officials so that we can move ahead to the next steps.
07/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 350 6605: Ohk you can go ahead
08/08/23, 9:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiriwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/08/23, 9:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, for the next steps, I request your cooperation in providing the following details as part of the visa application process. These details are essential for informing the university officials about your intention to apply for a visa at the embassy in the next few days. We will also need these details to request the university to arrange your bonafide letter accordingly.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tiriwashe 2K23JUL2192*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
