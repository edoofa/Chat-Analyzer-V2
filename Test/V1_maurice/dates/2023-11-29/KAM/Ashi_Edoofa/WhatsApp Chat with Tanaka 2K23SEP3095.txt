17/10/23, 10:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 02:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete all the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 078 1078: Oky
17/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 078 1078: Good afternoon l managed to watch all those videos and l understood them
17/10/23, 12:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263780781078, 

I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
17/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Firstly students should be open minded and they should give open opinions about anything without any fear or restrictions never the less they should also follow instructions so that they will be guided n be in the right path 
And the EwyL program decreases the burden to your parents and makes you play a major role in your learning process and students will be guided in every stage including the preparations of the statement of purpose
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Tanaka, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
17/10/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
17/10/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
18/10/23, 8:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanka,

18/10/23, 8:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
18/10/23, 8:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

19/10/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you Tanaka, in that case let's reconnect at 3pm
19/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 078 1078: 2 .User Interface and User Experience is the combination of two concepts which are user interface design and user experience design . UI It focuses on how a product looks and feels, while UX focuses on how users interact with the product.  User Interface and User Experience is the process of designing products that are both  pleasing and actually  easy to use. It involves a deep understanding of the users’ needs, motivations, and behaviors. This knowledge is then used to create an interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the product while providing a pleasant experience. User Interface and User Experience is an important part of web and app development, and it can have a significant impact on a product’s success. By understanding the user’s needs the  designers can create a product satisfying the user’s needs and provide an enjoyable experience. This system is being used in different departments of the business world .. some are used in production to increase efficiency and productivity In today’s digital world, UI and Uxis more important than ever. As more and more businesses are changing from their Old ways of operating to digital platforms, the importance of UI and Uxhas become increasingly apparent. UI and Uxis the practice of optimizing user interfaces and user experiences to ensure that customers have the best possible experience when using a product or service. The goal is to create a product or service that is easy to use, visually appealing, and intuitive. 

 3 …Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function. It is now considered as an architectural model for the inter computer communications.The  model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.
Each layer is self contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently in a synchronized manner 

There are the seven OSI layers. Each layer has different functions. We have the physical layer and the  main functionality of the physical layer is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node . It is the lowest layer of the OSI model and also It establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection.
We also have the  Data link layer This layer is responsible for the error-free transfer of data frames.It defines the format of the data on the network and It also provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices. The Third one is the network layer It is a layer 3 that manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network.It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors. The Forth layer is the transport layer  ensures that messages are transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data. The fifth one is the Session layer .It  is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices. The sixth one is the presentation layer .It acts as a data translator for a network.The last one is the Application layer. An application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network service.

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. We can program using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.  A programming language is instructions wrote by developers/programmers that a computer will understand to do what a computer user or programmer wants it to do. Programming is also known to some users as a computer language. The computer languages that programmers use is to be able develop application, scripts, or other set instructions for a computer to execute certain information within applications. Currently within the programming language there are a variety of different languages which are listed with in a database explaining which languages there are and what each language can do.  
 The most used programming language is Java script. It  is the most common coding language in use today around the world. This is for a good reason because most web browsers utilize it and it's one of the easiest languages to learn. JavaScript requires almost no prior coding knowledge once you start learning, you can practice and play with it immediately. And effectively. However we also have python . Python has consistently held its position as one of the most popular programming languages due to its versatility and simplicity. 

5 …An Interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code.It translates only one statement of the program at a time and a Compiler is a translator which takes input High-Level Language and produces an output of low-level language machine or assembly language. The work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code in the  format of 0s and 1s so that computers can understand.A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has a slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

19/10/23, 2:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (20th of October).
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/DYiQLA1bdp08cEDJju93CG
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Donnell Tanaka Paganda, and my EWYL group name is Tanaka EWYL23E0779. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
20/10/23, 8:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka, 

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you have gone through the above messages, and are you currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 078 1078: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Saloni and she has scheduled my session for Monday /Friday from 13:30 to 14:30
21/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka, I hope you are doing well. 

It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
21/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
21/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sure
21/10/23, 9:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263780781078. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 078 1078: Yes
21/10/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/10/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/10/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/10/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/10/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 078 1078: Yes that’s impossible
21/10/23, 9:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263780781078 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/10/23, 9:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/10/23, 9:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 078 1078: Oky noted
21/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 078 1078: Yes we are on the same page
21/10/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
21/10/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 078 1078: So I will have to pay registration fee and the tuition fee ?
21/10/23, 9:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263780781078 For now you don't have to pay any fees. Once you will receive your Offer Letter then you will be required to pay the registration fees. However, you will get the better clarity as move forward with the session.
21/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 789 8628: Thank you for the information
21/10/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 078 1078: Oky
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
21/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 078 1078: Oky so basically you saying $750 registration fee then  the $ 2050 caters for ?
21/10/23, 9:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: $750 is your registration fees and $2050 is your Tuition fees.
21/10/23, 9:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/10/23, 9:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
21/10/23, 9:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 078 1078: Oky
21/10/23, 10:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, Wishing you all a wonderful day!

In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
23/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Good afternoon how are you
23/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sure lm ready
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: A very good afternoon Parents and Tanaka, I am doing well thank you for asking. 

Now, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you must be excited to join us in the next year.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

15/11/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes that’s oky
15/11/23, 10:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I can truly understand these challenges. Let's reconnect tomorrow at 1:00pm.
16/11/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

With respect to the yesterday conversation, I hope you had a chance to go through your offer letter. Kindly share your response dear, I hope you are excited for the session today.
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Good afternoon Sir
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes I went through the offer and that is good news
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Oky sure Sir
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 078 1078: 1. 900 usd 
2. 3 years 
3 .300 usd 
4. 750 usd
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sir
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Oky noted  Sir
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Oky
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sir you can go on !
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Ooh oky noted !!!
16/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 078 1078: I have a Suggestion Sir
16/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263780781078, Please go ahead!
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 078 1078: I would  opt for Lovely Professional University
16/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263780781078 We can surely talk about that, however before that let's discuss more about this opportunity dear.
16/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes you can go on
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 078 1078: No Problem
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sure Sir
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 078 1078: No Chinhoyi but my Father Works and resides in Harare most of the time
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Oky noted Sir
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yeah sure but l would go for Mr Rajan since it’s relatively Cheaper
16/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263780781078, You can go ahead with Mr. Rajan. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Noted
16/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes sir l get it
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Noted
16/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 078 1078: No l don’t have any Queries
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780781078, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.

16/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Wow Amazing
16/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263780781078, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
16/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
16/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/11/23, 7:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
18/11/23, 7:48 am - +263 78 078 1078: Good morning  that was a great offer  and we actually discussed about it did but  we were opting for Lovely Professionals University 
So since you said we could receive various offers we were actually waiting for those and we will make the decision since we have a time
18/11/23, 7:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you want to wait for more offer letters, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
18/11/23, 7:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 7:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. As you want to go for Lovely Professional university, we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 7:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 8:16 am - +263 78 078 1078: Noted Sir
18/11/23, 8:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from Lovely Professional University and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias Univeristy, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias Univeristy and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Oky noted
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, May I please know if you are aware of the transfer option available?
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 078 1078: No I ain’t aware ?
18/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias University without risking losing out on the scholarship. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias University, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Ooh oky l get it now
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I am happy to know that now you are clear that you have the option to transfer your admission. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
18/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Yes and l still researcheing about it
18/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear!

28/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here please. To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
