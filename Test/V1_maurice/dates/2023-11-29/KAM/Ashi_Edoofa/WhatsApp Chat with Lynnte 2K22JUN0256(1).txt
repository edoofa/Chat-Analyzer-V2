I hope this message finds you well, despite the unexpected challenges you've encountered on your journey to Delhi. We understand that missing your flight from Bombay to Delhi has caused significant inconvenience, and we are here to provide the necessary assistance to ensure your safe and timely arrival at your destination.
06/09/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: First and foremost, we want to emphasize that boarding a train as an alternative is not advisable. Train journeys in a new country can be arduous, time-consuming, and pose certain risks. It may take more than 24 hours to reach Delhi, which can be exhausting and may not guarantee your safety. Therefore, we strongly urge you to communicate with your travel agent and impress upon them that your safety and timely arrival are our utmost priorities. Under no circumstances should you consider taking a train.
06/09/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Instead, we recommend booking the next available flight to Delhi. If you encounter any difficulties or resistance from your travel agent, kindly discuss your concerns with them and involve your parents if necessary. Ideally, the expenses for this flight should be covered by your agent since they are responsible for the initial booking mishap.
06/09/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: While we understand that luggage expenses are a concern, please firmly convey to your agent that they should bear these costs due to the booking error.

Should you decide to take the SpiceJet flight departing at 09:00 PM, even though it's a holiday in India, please rest assured that our team will be available at the airport to receive you in the morning. However, if you opt for the train journey, it may not be possible for us to provide the same level of assistance, and you may encounter additional challenges.
06/09/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Your safety and well-being are our top priorities, and we are fully committed to supporting you during this journey. Please maintain open communication with your agent, discuss your concerns with your family, and prioritize booking a flight to Delhi. 

Regardless of the circumstances or arrangements made by your travel agent, please stay in touch with us and provide regular updates on your arrival details. This will enable us to be well-prepared to assist you upon your arrival in India.

We understand the stress and inconvenience this situation has caused you, and we are here to ensure a smooth and safe continuation of your journey to Delhi. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
06/09/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lynnte

I hope you are doing well, We are still waiting for your response, Kindly share an update with us as we need to share your arrival status with the team and university officials to make sure you arrive in Delhi smoothly.

11/10/23, 10:54 am - +91 93546 23922: *Urgent Tuition Fee Payment Reminder and Important Warning*
Dear Parents and Guardians,

We hope this message finds you well. We have made several attempts to remind you about the outstanding tuition fees of *$45* 

This message serves as an official warning from the university administration. Failing to settle the outstanding tuition fees will have severe consequences for your child's academic progress. We understand that financial situations can be challenging, and we are committed to assisting you in any way we can. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 10:54 am - +91 93546 23922: Consequences of not paying fee is *Academic Loss* Students with unpaid fees may not be allowed to attend classes, which will directly impact their education. This absence may result in missing crucial lectures, assignments, and exams. Attendance records would therefore be affected and hence Consistent absences due to unpaid fees can lead to a significant drop in attendance, potentially preventing your child to take up exams and therefore backlogs. Accumulating backlogs can result in additional academic challenges and the imposition of high penalty charges.

We genuinely care about your child's education and well-being, and we want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Therefore, we are issuing this warning in advance to prevent any confusion and to allow you ample time to address the outstanding tuition fees.

Our primary goal is to support your child's academic journey and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Your cooperation is crucial in this regard, and we trust that you will take this warning seriously.
11/10/23, 11:42 am - +91 70272 86250: Greetings,im currently lost about the $45 because you wants said  that the half of $850 was $425 so l already paid $200 so l am left with $25

14/10/23, 7:44 am - +91 93546 23922: *Clarification on Funds Transfer through Rajan*

Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with some clarification regarding the recent money transfer made through Rajan. We greatly appreciate your support and the funds you sent through him.

Upon receiving the funds, we discovered that a portion of the money was deducted as an agent's commission during the transfer process. As a result, the amount received by Rajan was $200.

Subsequently, when the funds were sent to India, there were additional charges and conversion fees, which led to a further deduction. After these deductions, the amount that has reached us in India is $180.

Currently, there is a remaining balance of $45 that needs to be covered to ensure that all the fees and expenses associated with the transfer are settled completely.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for your ongoing support, and we look forward to resolving this matter promptly.
14/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 948 6105: Greetings to you all here we are all fine thanks  for the clarification  but my question   is :Is it us to cater for those  charges  of your agent ?
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 948 6105: As we catered the charges of our agent of mukuru who is supposed  for that agent?
14/10/23, 10:15 am - +91 70272 86250: I think its not our fault that $20 was charged to send money to India because you are the once who gave us that reference to send money to Mr Rajan bacause it was better if we had sent the money direct to India the charges would never been $30
14/10/23, 10:16 am - +91 70272 86250: Things are not well to the extent that we can manage to send $200 and $30 of charges.Its not fair if we had sent the money directly to India through Mukuru they was nothing like $30 only for charges
14/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 948 6105: U should have gave us direct bank or agent of India rather than giving us that agent of Zimbabwe which will cost all those charges  I don't think its our fault  its your own costs not of us
14/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 948 6105: So you saying sending sending 200 us costs 30 us to India is it what u are saying
16/10/23, 5:48 am - +91 93546 23922: Greetings
Yes parents that is the transaction charges, <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 948 6105: 30 us on 200 ????
16/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 260 3127: Sir are u saying that is that it's how u help  and that is your charge but it's too much we area very concerned about it as a parent
16/10/23, 10:55 am - +91 93546 23922: Dear parents, I fully grasp your concerns, and I want to acknowledge that we did communicate the high charges to you in advance. These fees align with Mukuru's standard rates and are incurred when transferring funds to India. Unfortunately, we have limited control over these charges, but our aim is to help you better comprehend the situation.
16/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 260 3127: U have no  control over this charge s  sir    so it mean   something   u are not helping us high  charges with penalty fee  no better  help  that 30us is to much Sir
16/10/23, 11:20 am - +91 70272 86250: Sir why did you tell my parents to send money direct to India through mukuru the expenses would never had been $30 to send $200
16/10/23, 11:23 am - +91 70272 86250: Mr Mukund its you who refered me to Mr Rajan ofwhich its you who knows how you were going to have your money to India as $200 because we already put our charges on the money we send to you and for other payments we had been doing before you never told us about the expenses to India
16/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 948 6105: If u have told me before about  those high charges I don't think  I was to send through Mr  Ragan I was to send it directly to linnet then she pay  her self it won't  take too much charges like 30 us on 200
