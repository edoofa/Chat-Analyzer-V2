We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
17/10/23, 8:11 am - +263 77 271 6627: Well noted
17/10/23, 8:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now, Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
17/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 271 6627: We are all added to this group. Currently you are talking to Munashe, that is Tinashe's father. Tinashe is at a boarding school several kilometers from where we live. The challenge is  that he is not available since boarding schools this side do not allow use of cell phones by students
17/10/23, 8:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: It's nice to meet you Mr. Munashe. Absolutely understandable and I can appreciate that some schools restrict students from using their phones or other electronic gadgets to help them focus on their academics. St Mark's High School strongly believes in this approach, and therefore, we are patiently waiting for him and are indeed looking forward to connecting with Tinashe.
17/10/23, 8:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: At the same time, I am also glad to see that you are able to connect with us on your his behalf. This ensures that he stays on track in his academic journey. As I am interacting with you, the father of our proud Edoofian, and you are the one who will play a significant role in shaping Tinashe's education and career?
17/10/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 271 6627: That's right will do my best to shape his education and career
17/10/23, 8:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation Mr. Munashe! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. 

The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you as guardians or the student won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
17/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 271 6627: Well noted

19/10/23, 9:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/10/23, 9:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/10/23, 9:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/10/23, 9:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 271 6627: Very clear
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 271 6627: Yes I am
19/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 271 6627: It's clear thanks
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 271 6627: Yes the first step is message from founder's office we may proceed
19/10/23, 9:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/10/23, 9:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

19/10/23, 9:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Tinashe, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 271 6627: 10:30
19/10/23, 9:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 10:30am for our next session.

19/10/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tinashe,  As we move forward with your journey, I would like to follow up on the videos we shared with you. Can you please confirm if you have watched the videos?
If you have watched the videos, please share your understanding and insights with us.
19/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 271 6627: Greetings I can't hear the whole videos clearly on this phone but could hear  on some videos the advantages of being Edoofian considering how expensive it is to learn abroad
19/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your situation @263772716627. I'll recommend you to watch these videos from another phone whenever you get the time as these videos are very important for your journey. However, I would like to share some insights with you.
19/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Are you ready for the same?
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes I am
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/10/23, 12:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 271 6627: I do agree with this
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

I hope this message finds you well. As we move forward with your journey, I would like to follow up on the documents we shared with you. Can you please confirm if you have completed the forms and document?

21/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 271 6627: 2. The Business Process Management   Life Cycle is comprised of five stages which are: 
1.Process Design
2.Modeling
3.Execution
4.Monitoring
5.Optimisation
Each phase of the life cycle builds from the previous stage and this results in an efficient and effective business process management system that meets the needs of the business.

Design~ Model~ Execute~ Monitor ~ Optmise

Design stage is the foundation of a successful BPM initiative and is about understanding the current state of the business processes as well as developing an improvement plan.This involves identifying the organizational goals and determining the processes that needs to be redesigned to meet these goals.

Modeling involves identifying inputs and outputs of each process and mapping the entire production processes so as to see how the processes works and identify room for improvement. 

Execution  involves taking all the planning into action .It helps in identifying potential problems and allow for adjustments.

Monitoring involves establishing a set of metrics and Key Performance Indicators to monitor business processes. These includes customer satisfaction and error rates.

Optimising stage is about continuously improving the business processes that have been identified and analysed.The goal is to make the business processes more effective and streamlined.
21/10/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263772716627, Although we are still waiting for your update on SOP form and academic documents. Kindly share an update with us.
21/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 271 6627: 3. Businesses creates jobs. The existence of a new business in the market brings about jobs to multiple job seekers. This is why the Indian government launched the Startupindia to promote new businesses. This inturn creates a lot of job opportunities.

It promotes GDP and per capita income. Businesses increases productivity which promotes output. This  increases the national income thus promoting an increase in per capita income.

Again, is the increase in the standards of living .As businesses emerge ,many get  employed thereby reducing the levels of unemployment. This therefore improves the living standards of the people as they will be able to access basic commodities.


To add to that is the increase in exports that is brought about by businesses. As they undertake production processes,  they increase the national output. This will increase goods available for exportation hence access to foreign currency. 

Moreso, businesses take part in corporate social responsibility which contribute to economic development. This may include infrastructure development .
21/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 271 6627: 5.Human resources is the fundamental and active factor of production. Labour has important contribution to the production of commodities. They take part in the production of goods and services hence are important in keeping the company running.

To add to that, human resources brings about income to the organization. They produce goods and services to meet human needs and wants. It's through their ability to meet customer preferences that the organization gain income  from sale.

Moreso, human resource assist in building a better brand name and image for the organization. As they produce, the quality of the goods and services can tell a story to the organization's clients. If the quality is good enough, a better brand name and image is created.

Furthermore, the existence of the organization depends on its human resources. It's the nature and commitment of the labour force that determines how long the organization will last. If the labour force is weak and reluctant, the organization may incur huge losses hence a reliable human resources will guarantee its existence even in the long run.
23/10/23, 7:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe, I hope you had a great weekend. 

Today, I wanted to discuss something of great importance with you. As we are all aware, the EWYL session that was scheduled to begin tomorrow. I wanted to take this opportunity to encourage you to actively participate in our today's sessions so that you can join your EWYL journey tomorrow without any delays. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 7:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to thank you for sharing your response for the academic question. Although, in order to move further with the journey May I kindly know if you have complete the SOP form shared with you? Also, We are also waiting for your academic documents. Kindly do share an update with us.
23/10/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 271 6627: Morning. Thanks so much. Sop form is completed. Tinashe is currently writing his A level and so at the  moment we only have the O level certificate which I have informed his mother to share on this platform
23/10/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know @263772716627 as you have mentioned that Tinashe is writing his A level, in that case you can share the statement of entry with us. His school will provide this document, kindly connect with them for this document as it's very important in order to submit your application at the university.
23/10/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (24-Oct-2023).
23/10/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Thank you for providing your sharing the above documents with us, We are also looking forward for your A level results or Statement of Entry. However, In the meantime I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
25/10/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 271 6627: Good Morning. Yes I am available
25/10/23, 10:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263772716627. However before we proceed, I would like to take an update by when you will be able to share the pending document?
25/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 271 6627: You mean A level results?. Tinashe is currently writing A level
25/10/23, 10:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263772716627, I am aware that Tinashe is writing his A level currently, although in order to submit his application to universities we need the Statement of Entry, this document can be availed by the school. I kindly request you to connect with the school regarding the document.
25/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 271 6627: Ok I understand. Let me contact the school today
25/10/23, 10:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263772716627. Please makes sure to share an update with us by the end of the day. For now, let's start our today's session.
25/10/23, 10:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* nd it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 271 6627: Yes it's accurate
25/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 11:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263772716627, May I know if you have taken a note of the above message?
25/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 271 6627: Well noted
25/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 271 6627: You are right it's not possible to at multiple universities
25/10/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263772716627. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 271 6627: That's correct we discussed all that
25/10/23, 12:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes we are
25/10/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Noted
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 271 6627: It's clear
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263772716627 for your kind words. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Have reviewed the benefits
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tinashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Understood
25/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes it did
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Well understood
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 271 6627: I have understood
25/10/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 271 6627: May you please provide information I am not aware
25/10/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 271 6627: I see now. Being an Edoofian comes with lots of advantages.
25/10/23, 6:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263772716627. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Ok
25/10/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes I do
25/10/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, You will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Very clear
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes
25/10/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 271 6627: No queries
25/10/23, 7:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>

14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 271 6627: Good morning. We are pleased to receive the good news. Thank you Edoofa team
15/11/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinashe,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Thanks very much for the  congratulatory message. You are right we are very  very happy for this remarkable achievement
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, I am glad to see your excitement. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 271 6627: That's correct this approach would work for us
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 271 6627: 1.Per semester fee after scholarship is usd900 
2.Standard duration of the course is 3years
3.Admission  Procedure fee is usd300
4.Registration fee is usd750
15/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Thank you it's clear now
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 271 6627: I can see there are several options available
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263772716627 Are we still connected dear?
15/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes am connected. Was attending to a customer. We may proceed
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263772716627. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes I am
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes we are together
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes it's very clear
15/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes in Harare
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Ok thanks
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes please
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Thanks for sharing
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263772716627. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 271 6627: That's  correct
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes we'll understood
15/11/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes
15/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 271 6627: I would like to understand on the duration. I am told in some countries you have to learn the language for a year then you commence your studies. How is it in India
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query regarding the language difference. In the Indian education system, the language requirement varies across universities and courses. However, Most of the University require proficiency in English, and I am sure that Tinashe is good in this.
15/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes he is
15/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

15/11/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263772716627, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you? <This message was edited>
