I trust this message finds you all in good health. I am Ms. Vilsha, the head of admissions at Edoofa.

Unfortunately, Ms. Ashi, who has been assisting you with the visa procedures, is currently under the weather and, as a result, unable to communicate with you at the moment.

In her absence, I will be stepping in to assist you with the necessary procedures. I have scheduled a meeting with you on Wednesday before 12:00 PM. In the meantime, I encourage you to share the questions and concerns you may have so that I can address them before our scheduled time and provide you with a quick response.
20/09/23, 1:17 am - +263 71 731 1354: Good evening thank you noted.  We wanted  to know  when the last batch of students  are  expected to  arrive in India we are experiencing  some challenges  this side which my parents  are working on.  Hence we want to know  if there is still time?

In order to better assist you and explore possible solutions, could you kindly share the exact challenges you encountered in terms of financial preparation? Your response will help me assess the situation and determine the best course of action for your higher education and your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 794 1895: My parents are waiting  for their money from their projects to be deposited  into their accounts  however the money hasn't  been deposited as of yet so we are waiting  for the money to once it is deposited  we will then resume with the process hopefully  by the end of this month.
20/09/23, 1:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, @263717941895. If I may inquire, could you please specify which particular costs associated with the next steps are currently restricting you from moving forward? I understand that you have been waiting for funds from your parents' projects, but having clarity on the specific expenses will help us better understand and address your situation.
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 794 1895: Alright for now we have $1200 and won't be able to carter for flight ticket and other expenses  hence they want the money to increase so as to avoid shortage of money
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, @263717941895 and $1200 is more than enough for you to complete your visa application process and book your flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India. For the remaining amount that your parents are preparing, they can continue working to source it while you focus on your visa application process.

May I inquire about the reason for the delay in proceeding with this, doing so would ultimately help you save some time and ensure you can plan your travel as soon as your finances are in order, without having to rely on visa processes at a later stage?
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 794 1895: Alright. I didn't  know about that  I will discuss with  them when they are back from  work  and share their responses with you.

Hence, it is also crucial for you to make a timely decision and plan your arrival with ease. If there are any concerns that your parents still have, we are here to address them.

20/09/23, 2:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Delight. Please let me know once you are able to have a discussion with your parents.
21/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 794 1895: Good morning.  I had a conversation with  my parents  regarding  what we discussed.  However  they would like to have a breakdown  of how much is required for me to have a smooth stay in India without any challenges.  They are using the prices on the acceptance  letter I received  last year which I have shared
21/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 794 1895: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 12:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Delight

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. I appreciate your proactive approach in discussing the details with your parents. To provide a breakdown of the required expenses for your smooth stay in India, we can certainly use the cost mentioned in the acceptance letter you received last year, which you have kindly shared.
22/09/23, 12:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As per the offer letter, this is the breakup of your per semester fee:

1. Tuition Fee: $1225
2. Health Insurance: $25
3. Examination Fee: $75

Total per semester fee due to the university: $1325.
22/09/23, 12:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Since you have already made a payment of $700 towards your university registration fee, this amount will be adjusted against your first-semester fee of $1235. As a result, the remaining balance amounts to $625, which is to be paid within three days of your arrival to clear your first-semester fee. 

The fee for the second semester will be due in the following semester, typically in the month of January. I hope this addresses your query regarding your tuition fee due and helps you with a clear breakup?
22/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 794 1895: Good afternoon thank you for the update I will share the same with my parents

I trust this message finds you in good health, and I hope you had a blessed weekend. I wanted to reach out and inquire if you've been able to have a productive conversation with your parents regarding your higher education plans as we discussed last week?

26/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 794 1895: Good afternoon
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand and that would be absolutely fine @263717941895, please take another day's time to have a discussion with your family. Now that you and your family have all the details they need and are able to see the entire picture for your journey to India, I am sure they would make the right decision for your higher education and communicate their concerns transparently so that the decision that they make is a wise and well informed one. 

If you have any questions or concerns before your meeting tomorrow, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. That said, I would like to ask what time would be convenient for you to connect with us tomorrow so that I can schedule our discussion accordingly?

I will be able to connect with you after my session at 11
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263717941895, that would be fine, we can reconnect with each other tomorrow at 11:00 am. However, if I may ask, may I know which lesson are you referring to here in your above message?
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 794 1895: The EWYL session  with my mentor
27/09/23, 3:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying that, Delight. Wishing you the best of luck for your EWYL session tomorrow. I am eagerly looking forward to receiving an update from you tomorrow regarding your educational and arrival plans.
28/09/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 794 1895: Good morning admission. I  managed to have a conversation with my parents on what we discussed.  My parents  were very pleased about what you shared. However they were of the opinion  that I should start my process third week of October  since they are certain that all things will be okay as compared to starting  the process with limited funds.
30/09/23, 4:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Delight,

I hope this message finds you well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier, I was caught up with a few meetings the past two days and hence couldn't check your message.

However, I am pleased to hear that you had a conversation with your parents regarding our previous discussion. It's essential to have your family's support and understanding in this process.
30/09/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand that your parents are pleased with the information we shared, and I appreciate their confidence in our guidance. It's always wise to plan your journey with a clear and stable financial outlook. 

Hence, we respect your parents' opinion that starting the process in the third week of October, when they are more certain about the financial aspects, is a prudent approach. This will ensure that you have adequate funds and a smoother experience throughout the admission process.
30/09/23, 4:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please rest assured that we will be here to assist you when you are ready to begin your journey in October. However, I would like to bring to your attention that the academic classes for the current year commenced in August. By starting your procedures in October, there is a possibility that you may lag behind your peers.

To address this situation and provide you with a suitable option, you might consider planning your arrival for the January 2024 intake. This would align your admission timeline more closely with the academic schedule and help ensure that you're on track with your fellow students. Are you familiar with this option, and what are your thoughts on it?
03/10/23, 5:58 am - +263 71 731 1354: Good morning.  Thank you for the information  that you shared. However i have questions regarding  the 2024 intake. Are we expected to pay some money for the 2024 intake?
Will the dates on my documents be changed to that of 2024?
If i am to come there in 2024 will i be arriving  first week of  August. 
Can i apply for  my visa tgis year despite having  to report for school in 2024
05/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Greetings.  We were hoping to get a response from you. However to avoid lagging behind my parents have agreed for the January 2024 intake if that is okay .
06/10/23, 1:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Delight,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to continue our conversation regarding your university admission the other day. Unfortunately, I was unavailable when you replied to my messages.
06/10/23, 1:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Nonetheless, I am pleased to see that you made the most of the past couple of days by having a discussion with your parents and considering joining the university in January 2024. Along the same lines, could you kindly confirm if you are aware of the formalities and procedures you need to follow for this arrangement? Your understanding of the process will help ensure a smooth transition.
06/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Good afternoon . I am not sure but i think i would have to write a deferment letter
10/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Good afternoon . Sorry for the late response. We can have the conversation now if that is okay with you
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, absolutely Delight. I am pleased to see that you are available for our discussion, and I am more than willing to assist you with any queries you may have. However, to ensure that I can provide you with the right guidance, let me begin by clarifying the details regarding the academic intake you have on your mind.
10/10/23, 2:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you are aware, each year, there is only one academic intake, which is scheduled for the month of August. As a student, you have the option to join either the August 2023 intake or the August 2024 intake. Given that you needed some additional time to prepare for your arrival in India, you were not in a position to join the August 2023 or August 2023 intake. However, you also do not want to wait until the August 2024 intake.
10/10/23, 2:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In such a scenario, there is a provision that allows students to enroll in the August 2023 batch and take a term off for the first semester, spanning from August to December. Following this term off, you will arrive in India in January 2024 and commence your second semester.
10/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Doesn't this affect my education or i will be able to get some of the work that was done during the first semester
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Not at all Delight. Once you arrive in India in January 2024, your academic journey will kick off with Semester 2 of your degree program. This is where your formal coursework will begin.

On that note, let us also get into the term off, which is essentially a structured break during the academic year. This period coincides with the summer vacation and offers you a unique opportunity. 

During the term off, you will focus on catching up with the material from Semester 1. The primary aim here is to ensure that you are in sync with your fellow students and won't fall behind in your studies. Typically, term off classes are scheduled from May to July.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: After this dedicated period of study during the summer vacation, you will be well-prepared to resume your regular academic schedule. You will seamlessly transition into Semester 3, continuing your education alongside the classmates who initially started their studies in August 2023.

This approach allows you to strike a balance between your academic progress and the need for additional preparation time, making sure you're fully equipped to excel in your degree program. I hope this gives you a bit more insight?
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Yes i understand. Its s good approach
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 731 1354: * a
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed Delight. I am pleased that we are in sync. Now, let's also get into how a student manages his/her tuition fees during term-offs. As you are already aware, your tuition fee per semester stands at $1225. Given that you will be covering two semesters (Semester 1 and Semester 2) during your term off, the total tuition fee due for your first year will amount to $2450.
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In addition to the tuition fees, there are a couple of essential charges to consider. The per annum examination fee comes to $150, and the health insurance fee amounts to $50. When you combine these fees, the total amount payable to the university for your first year of education totals $2650.
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that we are in agreement with this breakdown of fees?
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 731 1354: I understand
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you have a clear understanding of the term off procedures, Rufaro. Now, let's discuss the payment of the fees. The total fee of $2650 that we just discussed does not need to be paid all at once.

As you have already paid a registration fee of $700, this amount will be adjusted against your total fees. Therefore, the remaining balance is $1950, which can be conveniently disbursed throughout the year according to the following schedule:

1. $650 in the month of October 2023.
2. $650 in the month of January 2024.
3. $650 in the month of April 2024.

This payment plan allows you to spread out the financial commitment over several months, making it more manageable and accommodating your financial needs. I hope you are clear with this as well?
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Alright . I will also share the same  with my parents.  I have a question can one also make a once off payment  in January of they are capable
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Delight. To clarify, we are referring to the possibility of making a one-time payment for the second and third parts of the tuition fees that are due, rather than the first part, which is due in the month of October. The first part, is essential for updating a student's status with the university and securing their seat accordingly.

So, if you or your parents have the capability and wish to make a single payment for the remaining tuition fees for the second and third parts, that option is generally available. It's important to ensure that the fees for the first part are paid in October to secure your registration, and then you can plan for the one-time payment of the subsequent parts according to the schedule. I hope you are clear with this? <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 731 1354: I understand ma'am.  I will share with them the information
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Delight. Now that we are on the same page, it is important for you to start with the formalities of the admisison. Hence, it's essential to inform the academic board about your decision. You can do this by sending an email to academicboard@edoofa.com. This helps us ensure that your academic records are updated correctly.

I hope this explanation clarifies what taking a term off means and how it can be a beneficial option for students who need to catch up on their coursework. At the same time, you would have to fill in the below term-off form and submit the same to us at your earliest so that we can update the university and get the formalities done.
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Alright  ma'am.  Can i submit the information tomorrow after i have a discussion with  my parents when they are back from work?
10/10/23, 3:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely Delight, that would be fine. When informing the academic board, you should provide them with a clear and concise message about your intention to take a term off and your plan to join the academic program in January 2024. In the same mail, you can attach the filled-in term-off application form as well.
10/10/23, 3:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Here is what you should include in your communication to the academic board:

1. Your Intention: Begin by stating your intention to take a term off from the academic program. Be clear that you will not be attending classes for the first semester, which is typically from August to December.

2. Term Off Plan: Explain that you will use this term off to prepare for your arrival in India and to catch up on Semester 1 coursework during the summer vacation (May to July). At the same time, you will abide by the fee commitments for the same process.

3. Joining Date: Mention that you plan to join the academic program in January 2024, specifically for Semester 2.

4. Request for Confirmation: Politely request confirmation from the academic board regarding the acceptance of your plan and any specific steps or formalities you need to complete for the term off and rejoining in January 2024.

5. Contact Information: Provide your contact information (admission group name and phone number) so that the academic board can easily reach out to you for any further details or clarification.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Alright ma'am. Thank you.  I will do so.
10/10/23, 3:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Delight It's indeed a good idea to have a detailed discussion with your parents regarding your academic plans. Please remember that if you have any questions or concerns, whether they arise tomorrow or at any point in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to assist you and address any queries you may have. Your education and academic journey are important, and we're here to support you every step of the way.

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to begin by offering my apologies for not being able to reconnect with you over the past couple of days. 

The universities have officially commenced the preparations for the August 2024 intake, and as a result, I had some crucial meetings with our affiliated universities, including Lovely Professional University. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 8:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These meetings were centered around discussions regarding the endowment benefits for the 2024 academic year, and they were regrettably unavoidable.

I trust this message finds you well and in good spirits. I have been expecting an update from your end and hope everything is progressing smoothly at your end. 

As you are aware, your Term-off Application at LPU is currently in process with the University officials. Despite the passage of a couple of weeks, we haven't received any updates from your side regarding the first installment of your tuition fees.
14/11/23, 10:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Considering the same, I wanted to remind you that timely payment of this fee is crucial to secure your scholarship and to ensure you are able to join the university in a timely manner. Hence I wanted to follow up with you. Can you please confirm if we are still connected with each other and if you have been able to make the payment by now?
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Good evening ma'am.

16/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 731 1354: Ma'am the challenge  is lack  pf communication from my side i worked  with assumptions.  I was offline for  the past two weeks. So i thought my place at the university  is no longer secured,  it was only after my phone was fixed that i realised we still have a chance so my parents are running  around to get the money since we had used it . I apologise for the lack of communication.
16/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 731 1354: I am fine ma'am
16/11/23, 12:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can truly understand your situation dear due to lack of communication the situation has become a bit challenging. However, I am glad to see that now you are working on raising the funds which we really appreciate @263717311354.

16/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 731 1354: Alright ma'am. I apologise once again.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No need to apologize dear, we are always here for you to assist you.

My parents have $150 but plans are being made on increasing  the amount after the saved money had been used for other things. I will update you if there is an increase.  Thank you
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with us @263717311354, as you have shared that the saved money has been used for same other things, with this I would like to understand what is the available amount dear, could you please share?
17/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 731 1354: $150 ma'am
17/11/23, 9:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263717311354. Thank you for letting me know dear with this I would like to conclude our session for today and wish you a blessed day ahead!
20/11/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Delight, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

With respect to our last conversation, as you have mentioned that you are working on raising the amount which we highly appreciate. However, considering the deadlines shared by the university we want to make sure that you complete the process smoothly. In light of this, I had the opportunity to share your concern with the team, as a conclusion they have shared that you can pay the available amount now and rest of the amount can be paid later. Please do let me know your thoughts on this.
21/11/23, 1:42 am - +263 71 731 1354: Thank you ma'am . I think its a hood idea but i will also share the same with my parents and get their input

I am glad to know that we are on the same page, please take your time and connect with your parents. We will be waiting for your response.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 794 1895: Alright ma'am.  I will connect with you to provide an update

In reference to our previous conversation, I hope you had a chance to connect with your parents and discuss regarding your first installment payment. On the same note, Could you please share your feedback with us?
25/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 71 794 1895: Good morning  ma'am.  Qm sorry u didn't get back to you soon . My parents were quite impressed with the idea but then we reised that if we were to send the $150 as it is due ti bank charges you may receive it as $16.50  since 11% is deducted.  My parents wanted to ask you to give them some time raise a reasonable  amount  whereby  if we are to send it it won't be a low figure if we send $150.
25/11/23, 8:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263717941895 I am glad to know that you liked this approach, however as you mentioned the concern regarding the bank charges, let me help you in that for the amount of $150 your charges will be around $16.50. If you make the payment of $150 then we will receive $133.5 on our end, however I would like to suggest that you can add the additional amount of $16.50 to the amount. May I please know your thoughts on this ?
