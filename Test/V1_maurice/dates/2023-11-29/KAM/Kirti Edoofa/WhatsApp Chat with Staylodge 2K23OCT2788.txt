For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Good afternoon
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 807 9668: You are welcome

06/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes they are clear
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes am following and l understood
06/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Noted
06/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Okay so as soon l receive the Letter of Intent l have to pay $500-$1000
06/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Its clear
06/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, that's correct. Upon receiving the Letter of Intent, the next step would be to reserve your place by paying the required registration fee, which typically ranges from $500 to $1000. This step secures your spot within the academic program. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Okay so this letter it comes after how long
06/11/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that the offer letter takes around one to two week's time to be received from the side of the university. Moving ahead, we will delve deeper into these details during the next parts of our discussion. For now, if I may ask, are you clear till the above mentioned steps?
06/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 807 9668: You said enrollment  fee is 350 after that l will pay 750 so my question is all these payments are the part of money you $500-$1000 you pay after receive letter of Intent
06/11/23, 10:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that query with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that $350 was the Enrollment Fee that you had paid to Edoofa for being a part of the scholarship program. 

Moving ahead, the $500-1000 is the university registration fee that would be used for completing your admission at the university. And here we have taken $750 as an example to help you in understanding about the process in a simple yet effective manner. I hope this is clear?
06/11/23, 10:47 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Okay now its clear
06/11/23, 10:47 pm - +263 71 807 9668: So this amount will paid one time or you can do payment plan
06/11/23, 10:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: For that, you do not have to worry as of now, since we will be discussing about the same moving ahead during our conversation. Stay assured you will get all the support needed from our end on that. I hope this is clear?
06/11/23, 10:51 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Its clear
06/11/23, 10:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, let us start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/11/23, 10:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
06/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes you can share
06/11/23, 10:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Let me share the videos with you here please.

08/11/23, 7:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
08/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Its accurate
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes its impossible
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Noted
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Noted
08/11/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes we are on the same page
08/11/23, 8:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 807 9668: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 807 9668: I don't understand  it
08/11/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour is getting late on my end, I'm regrettably reaching the end of my available time for today.

Hence, let's reconnect tomorrow from 09:30 AM onwards to continue our conversation. Wishing you a restful and pleasant evening, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family as well.
08/11/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Same to you
09/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Dear Parents and Staylodge!
I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits.

As the time for our scheduled session has arrived, I would like to confirm your readiness to proceed with our discussion. This will allow us to move forward seamlessly with the next steps in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready to begin with our discussion here?
09/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 807 9668: Good morning yes am ready.
09/11/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know what is it that you did not understand here?
09/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 807 9668: On this statement
09/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, I will be helping you in understanding the same here. Before that, can you please let me know what is it that you did not understand in the same?
09/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 807 9668: I wannt to know that l have to pay $1000 in two weeks or this is an example
09/11/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here dear. On that note, I would like to mention that here we have considered it as an example. However, usually, the deadline that is given from the side of the universities is of 15 days, but since we understand that it might become challenging for the parents to pay this amount within a span of two weeks, there are certain measured in place to help you with that. That includes a payment plan and certain other benefits as well that we will discuss moving ahead during our conversation. I believe this is understood, right?
09/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 807 9668: Yeah now its clear
09/11/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. With that, shall we proceed with our discussion here?
09/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 807 9668: You may proceed.
09/11/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2350 as per the above example.
09/11/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2350 - $1000 = $1350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $675 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $675 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
09/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees. <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 807 9668: Okay l want know for example my fee is $1800 per annual  then l started to do EWYL then l got my  60 credits so that credits will be substrates to my fees
14/11/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/11/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, when it comes to this query of yours, I would like to mention that yes, please, this is correct. All the credits that you would earn will get adjusted in your per annum fee please.
14/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
14/11/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 807 9668: No l don't have queries so far.
14/11/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

14/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

14/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 807 9668: You may proceed
14/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
14/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
14/11/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/11/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/11/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Following
14/11/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/11/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Following
14/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
14/11/23, 6:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 807 9668: You may proceed
14/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 81 students have already secured their seats, leaving 19 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Yes am excited
14/11/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Your enthusiasm is truly appreciated, and I share your excitement. We believe in your potential and are confident that you will make the most of this wonderful opportunity. Rest assured, the journey ahead will be rewarding and transformative.

We will now move ahead to process your university application and will share the updates with you here moving ahead. For now, we can conclude our discussion here. Wishing you a blessed night!
14/11/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Thank you sleep well
16/11/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Staylodge!
I hope this message finds you well.

As we discussed earlier, your EWYL Program was initially scheduled to commence on November 7th, 2023. However, last week marked the Diwali festival here in India, and our team was observing this significant celebration, resulting in a pause in our operations.

Considering this, I'd like to inform you that your EWYL Program is rescheduled to start on November 21st, 2023. Therefore, I kindly request you to re-submit your EWYL Form with the updated date mentioned and share it with me here. However, since it is already too late on my end, I would request you to work on your EWYL Form again and share it with me by tomorrow at 01.00 PM so that I can relay the same information ahead to the EWYL Team and get your EWYL Program started. Until then, wishing you a blessed night!

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:24 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Kirti, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting once your offer letter arrives.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer. <This message was edited>

27/11/23, 11:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group Of Institutes* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship. <This message was edited>

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Thank you 😊
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 807 9668: I went  through my offer letter  so l wanted to ask
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Noted
28/11/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 807 9668: 1.$1000
2.$900 
3.$500
28/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1100.
28/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
28/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 807 9668: So $1100 it also include accommodation fee
28/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $500 = $1600. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 807 9668: Understood
28/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
