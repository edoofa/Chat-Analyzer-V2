12/09/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Dephine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Dephine's higher education?
11/10/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Dephine.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few months, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263772816743 @263773231800?
14/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Deohine.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
14/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good day. Very sorry for not responding on time. I was having a challenge with my phone.

I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 281 6743: confirmirm this is correct
17/10/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 281 6743: I believe we have done 1-3  and we should be moving to step 4 now
17/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I'll be more than happy to help you recall the steps. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
17/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you have any questions please feel free to ask?
18/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dephine.

18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me, may I know what happened?
18/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 281 6743: My father inlaw fall from a tree while trying to prune the gumtree. He has a fructure above the the. Was supposed to undergo surgery today. Unfortunately the doctor didn't come today.
18/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Above the knee.
18/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about your father-in-law's accident and the delay in his surgery. It must be a challenging and worrying time for your family. Please pass on my best wishes for his recovery, and I hope the medical attention he requires is provided as soon as possible. I understand this is not a convenient time for you to proceed with the discussion, in that case, we can connect in the evening.
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Thank you for comforting message. We hope he will get assistance soon.
We can resume at night
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 07:30 pm.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 281 6743: It's fine.
18/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good evening. are we still proceeding today.
18/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, if you are comfortable connecting with us now, we can move ahead.
18/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dephine.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263772816743 @263773231800?
19/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good evening. My apologies for not getting in touch on time. Have a challenge with phone, network and zesa. I have traveled yesterday. May we resume tomorrow evening. My apologies wants again.
19/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that issues with phone, network, and power supply (ZESA) can sometimes disrupt communication. I hope your travels have been safe and that you've been able to address these challenges. We can certainly resume our conversation tomorrow, can I anticipate that you will be available to connect with us tomorrow at 02:30 pm?
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Will try to squeeze for that. Will keep you posted
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
19/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Thank you and same to you
20/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Dephine,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good afternoon. Now available for connecting. Sorry once again for being late
20/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you are ready to start with your discussion now?
20/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes I am ready
20/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes I can confirm it's correct
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes I agree. It's not possible to study at multiple universities.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Noted
20/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Noted. Will secure the seat within the stipulated period
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes it was discussed during the counseling session
20/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes we are on the same page. However May you also kindly assist with the ranges of accommodation. Roughly how much per month
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we are getting there. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
20/10/23, 11:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Dephine,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes have taken note of the example above. Confirm the following too.
1) deposit will be part of the fees and payment time is 2-4 weeks from time of offer.
2)Accommodation will be offended at the university.
3) Food will be offered at school though it will charged separate from the fees
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Very sorry for the disconnection. I will be available on Tuesday. Monday I will be traveling back to work. 600KM. It will be best for Tuesday
23/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Dephine,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that you must be busy traveling that is alright, please. I hope you travel safely. Now coming back to your query, please do not worry once you receive the offer letter, regarding the accommodation and food everything will be discussed in detail. Please do not worry.
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Dephine,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 281 6743: good afternoon. i am now available for the session. we can start if you are free
25/10/23, 4:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can connect now, I am available to connect.
25/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 281 6743: son we can proceed. hope you enjoyed your holiday yesterday.
25/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I had a wonderful time with my family. May I know if you are clear so far?
25/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 281 6743: yes i am clear
25/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Noted. This is clear. Half of the payment to be paid within the first three days of arrival and the balance to be paid in January of the coming year or to be cleared on monthly installments that is if payment plan has been put in place or agreed with the universit
25/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand your second statement better?
25/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 281 6743: I said since students will travel to India in August. First payment will be done upon arrival within three days. Balance to be paid in January of the following year or balance will be paid in monthly installments if a payment plan has been agreed.
25/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That depends upon the parent here, they can communicate with us and if they want monthly payments to clear the financial pressure they can do that as well, or if they wish to pay the remaining balance in January 2025 they can do that as well.
25/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 281 6743: OK. I think it's clear
25/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Noted. Registration fee, visa fees and travel expenses.
25/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 281 6743: The admission process is clear. My next question is which universities are on offer or this is the stage we are now entering.
25/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your question, as you might be aware we are connected with 250+ universities hence providing you with the list of universities would not be possible for me. However, I understand where you are coming from as a parent, and being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for Dephine.
25/10/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Well appreciated.
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/10/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Will be well excited. It's long overdue. Thank you once again for the support
25/10/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I would love to continue with our discussion, however as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
25/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Will be available. Thank you once again. We really appreciate
26/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes, I understand that students should have at least 2 points to proceed.
26/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes, We are in agreement.
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes its clear,
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes, Its clear
26/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Its clear.
26/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 281 6743: The process is clear. no questions on what has been covered. once again, thank you for clear explanations.
26/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As Dephine's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process?

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

16/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 296 3794: This message was deleted

(4) Registration fee. Non refundable and non Transferable
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 296 3794: Admission and procedure fee is 300usdb,.
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 296 3794: Registration fee $750
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Hope I have responded correctly now
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 281 6743: yes fee structure is clear.
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 296 3794: Will the student be working to reduce the accommodation expenses. I would also like to know if the place will have stoves and other necessities
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 281 6743: (1) On campus accommodation. If funds permits a 2 seater will be preferred students
16/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the EWYL program is there to help you as you will be learning and earning as well and the food is included in the cost stated, please.
16/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes accommodation at the campus gives students more time to do their school work
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes. Noted for the examination fees for the 2 semesters
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Noted on the deadlines. We are following closely to all the steps
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 296 3794: Noted. Yes please proceed with the explanation
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 296 3794: Noted with. Thank you we have understood the details clearly
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 281 6743: I am residing in Bulawayo
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Thanks for the assistance and contact details. We will always make arrangements to meet Him.
16/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 281 6743: This payment of 2 installments will be more flexible and have  lesser constraints
16/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
16/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Have gone through them. The one for Mr Rajan seems to be more favorable as all details will be recorded for easy tracking.
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please let me share the details just incase, if you need them.
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Also on the other note. Taking you back. When results came out with good pass. Is there possibility of fees reduction to more than 50%
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible. If you recall our previous conversation, for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
16/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Yes it's clear
16/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 281 6743: On first year i would rather prefer accommodation at campus while she familiarize with the environment. at campus you will be comfortable that she will be getting enough food and there will be control from the university
16/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is completely your choice here, however, we recommend off-campus accommodations and even our student prefer that since it is cheaper, allow the freedom for the students to cook for themselves and the food is also included in the Off-campus accommodation as well, the students also feel like they are at home away from home because of staying close by.
16/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 281 6743: It's fine if that's the case. But on arrival at airport. the students will be accompanied by representatives from Edoofa or they will find their way to the university
16/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please our representatives will be present at the airport during the arrival of the students if during the visa time you follow our instructions and book your tickets as we guide because we want students to arrive in batches, however, you do not need to worry about that right now, please we will be guiding you throughout the journey.
16/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Thanks for the update and clarity
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 281 6743: thanks for the guidance too. we really appreciate all the effort and support you are giving us. will encourage the students to work hard too.
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 281 6743: its clear. i have understood
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 281 6743: yes it clarify.
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 281 6743: one more question. there are 2 semesters per year. how long is each semester and the semester break?
16/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, each semester is of 6 months to be precise and the semester break is around a month and a half, please.
16/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 281 6743: noted  with thanks

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good evening. My apologies for not being able to connect today. Heard limited access  to the the phone today.
Hopefully you have fully recovered.

21/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Dephine,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:43 pm - +27 73 417 1131: Good day to you we may proceed
21/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Good day. to you all. yes, we may proceed.
21/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing.  I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +27 73 417 1131: We have discussed about the offer letter as a family
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Firstly, was the excitement to receive the offer letter.  then questions follows, is this going to be achievable. payment plan and mode of payments.  accommodation and travel arrangements.
21/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 281 6743: when initial deposit is paid, balance on fees and accommodation fees will it be deposited in the same account or students will pay direct to the university. also, say i have managed to secure the place and challenges arose that will led to my failure to travel. will i be refunded on payments made or will be given another option.
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772816743, when a student is in their home country, the only payment required is the university registration fee to secure the scholarship seat. The balance fees and accommodation charges can be paid after the student arrives in India. The university instructs students to make payments through Edoofa during this phase because, when making the initial payment, students are still in their home country and may face challenges in physically visiting the university or banks for payment tracing.
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: By allowing Edoofa to handle the initial payments, the university ensures timely and accurate processing of payments, even from a distance. This is also the reason that the details provided in your offer letter are related to Edoofa, as this privilege is granted to facilitate smooth transactions during the pre-departure phase.
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you arrive in India, you'll have the option to choose whether to continue making payments through Edoofa or directly to the university. The decision on payment modes will be entirely yours, and we will assist you accordingly. You'll have the flexibility to decide on payment methods at that stage based on your preference. I hope this addresses the first query that you had?
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 281 6743: yes, its fully addressed. thanks for clarifying on th e issue
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, you are clear. Now coming to the second query of yours, I understand the concern you have. However, you know that the students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program have made a firm commitment to pursue their education abroad. Failure to travel to India is uncommon once the admission fee is paid, as the students are dedicated to advancing their studies and are all set to join the university.
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given your question, I am interested in understanding the specific circumstances or concerns that led to this inquiry. What reasons or scenarios do you have in mind that might lead a student to not be able to travel? Your insights will help us address any potential challenges or uncertainties you may have.
21/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 281 6743: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 281 6743: sorry for late response, was caught in another meeting, Reasons which may cause are, financial constraints on the time of travelling or failure secure travel documents on time.
21/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, and I understand your concerns, and this concern is faced by many parents it is not a concern that is only faced by you and it will definitely occur in the future if this is the concern that you have to stay assured please during the time of counseling sessions you were informed about how Edoofa will be guiding you with the documents, that would be needed for Dephine's arrival and ensure that they are to that you have a smooth visa process and are in a position to plan your journey to India without any hassle in terms of documents.
21/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now when you mention that you might have financial concerns while planning your travel to India, I understand that this can also be a case, in that case, I think you would probably require more time? Right, because you still want Dephine to come to India you still want to get access to a higher quality of education your goal still remains the same, in that case, what we can do is we can have a discussion with the university and allow you some time to plan arrival a little late compared to the normal intake when your finances are all prepared so please do not worry about it, there are students who have been able to go through the same, and they have been given assurance from our end always and they are able to plan their travel and arrive for their education as well.
21/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Thanks for the update and clarity. I am sure it's clear. I really appreciate your support
21/11/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 281 6743: I have done a bit. Still to learn more
21/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
21/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
21/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

21/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 281 6743: Would prefer the $300 settlement which will clear in December
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
22/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dephine.

I have been running around since last week trying to put this in order. have submitted my requests to my employers for payment approval for the university fees as per the norm but this seems not going well as they have rejected my request opting for local Universities.
