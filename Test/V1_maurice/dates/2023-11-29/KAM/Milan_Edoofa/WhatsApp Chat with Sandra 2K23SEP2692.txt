If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Noted ma'am . Yes we may start
06/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 267 7628: I am done
06/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes I am
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes they are
06/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Y s
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

10/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 387 2209: There is help in the universe only if you ask for it...ask experts
For one to be successful they should follow instructions and be open minded
Edoofa scholarship program founders have taken a lot of time to identify schools for the best education as they look at see us as their children and they are our parents
Edoofa is not about money but focuses on the quality of education which is affordable too
Students are also involved in the student community to give students the ability of serving the community
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Okay maam
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Okay
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.

11/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263713872209 @263783267915 @263772677628 I was hoping to get a response, however, you did not respond may I know we are still connected with each other?

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Sandra Moyo, and my EWYL group name is Sandra EWYL23E0767. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 12/10/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
11/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
12/10/23, 7:35 am - +263 77 267 7628: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Noted maam
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Noted maam
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Well noted maam
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 267 7628: No queries ma'am. I have a question how much is the flight
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have no queries. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself.
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Ok maam
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes maam
12/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
12/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
13/10/23, 5:20 am - +263 77 267 7628: Noted maam
13/10/23, 5:20 am - +263 77 267 7628: Yes I have reviewed them
13/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Sandra, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Noted
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
13/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 267 7628: No I'm following maam
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 267 7628: No
13/10/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes maam
13/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate the application* after which if they accept the application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

17/10/23, 11:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sandra,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family!

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
17/10/23, 11:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter.

18/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 267 7628: Thank you
18/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening once again Parents and Sandra,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/10/23, 12:35 am - +263 77 267 7628: Noted
19/10/23, 11:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, parents and Sandra,

I hope you are all in good health and high spirits. I was expecting a response from you yesterday evening at our scheduled time, but it seemed that you were unavailable, which prevented us from starting our discussion.

Could you please inform us if there were any issues or challenges that made you unavailable for our conversation? This will help us understand the situation better and reschedule our discussion accordingly.
19/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 267 7628: I was having a network challenge yesterday
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I see Sandra. Network challenges can be expected during the rainy season, and I completely understand. We'll work around these challenges and adjust our discussions as needed. 

Hence, if you could let me know a suitable time to connect with you and your family, it would be greatly helpful in resuming our discussion?

Given the network challenges you faced yesterday, our conversation was delayed and hence, I want to ensure that we stay on track and progress swiftly with the next steps in your admission process.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Surely maam. Is it possible for us to connect now
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Sandra. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
19/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 267 7628: 1. 1000
2. $0
3. 2250
4.250
5.1000
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details Sandra. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded her a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to her will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
19/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 267 7628: It is
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see we are together Sandra. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, your remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 4:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education at MVN University is $2250.

In continuation of our discussion regarding your offer letter, as you can see in your offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments: the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means your total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It's important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Sandra. Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities that are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: lease let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes I have
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 387 2209: What about food
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship. This is the reason his per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education.
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
19/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 387 2209: It does
19/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 387 2209: But I have a question
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said Sandra, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $750 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this Sandra?
19/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 387 2209: I agree
19/10/23, 10:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective Sandra. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in Abdul's offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after he arrives in India will be $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
19/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 387 2209: I would prefer the one that allows me to save 750 annually even if it entails a higher registration fee
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Noted
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This remaining fee of $1500 will be required to be paid after you arrive in India. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $750, with a six-month gap between them.

The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of your arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
19/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes
19/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Failure to settle the 1000 with in the 15 days what will happen
19/10/23, 10:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Sandra. Before we move forward and address this query, I would like you to share the query that you had on your mind earlier, please share the same with us and we will do our best to address the same for you.
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Ok firstly on the offer letter there is a part saying the registration fee can not be refunded if I fail to produce needed documents so currently I do not have a passport so after I pay this 1000 u will help me apply for a visa right...Is there a stipulated time for application of the Visa or it can be done anytime when I get a passport
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Secondly if I fail to pay the 1000 within 15 days what happenes
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, I understand your concern about the registration fee. To clarify, after you pay the registration fee, we will assist you with the visa application process once you have obtained your passport. While there isn't a strict stipulated time for visa application, it's advisable to initiate the process well in advance.

Considering that your intended arrival for studies is in August 2024, we will start your visa application around February 2024. This will allow us sufficient time for processing and ensure everything is in order for your travel and by then you too would have secured your passport.
19/10/23, 10:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, the clause in the offer letter about non-refundable registration fees if you fail to produce needed documents primarily applies to students who apply to the university independently, without Edoofa's assistance.

When you work with Edoofa, we as the admission team guide you throughout the process and ensure that you have all the required documents in place before your admission process is initiated. We take the necessary steps to assist you in completing the documentation requirements and avoid situations where the registration fee becomes non-refundable.

In essence, with Edoofa's support, you can be confident that your documentation will be well-prepared and complete, minimizing any risks associated with the non-refundable nature of the registration fee. I hope this addresses the first query you had?
20/10/23, 6:14 am - +263 77 267 7628: Yes it does
20/10/23, 10:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, Sandra, moving forward to your second query, I will certainly address it and provide you with the necessary clarification. However, could you please share the context or reason behind your inquiry? Are you facing a specific challenge that makes you concerned about paying the registration fee, or is this information you are seeking for general knowledge? Understanding your situation better will help me provide a more tailored response.

In addition, I would like to wish you a very good morning. I hope you are refreshed and ready to continue our discussion.
20/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 267 7628: I am sorry I couldn't connect with you in time
20/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes I'm facing a financial challenge
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Sandra. Thank you for sharing that you are facing a financial challenge. I appreciate your openness in discussing this. Financial challenges can indeed be a significant concern when it comes to education. To assist you better, could you please elaborate on the nature of the financial challenge you're currently experiencing? This will help me provide you with more specific guidance and potential solutions based on your situation.
20/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Well I may say the 1000 honestly my parents cannot gather it within 15 days the timeframe is too short
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I can see the concern you have, Sandra, and this is something we at Edoofa resonate with. Hence, there has been a special gesture of the Endowment Plan that has been granted to students like you, considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe and the financial priorities parents have in place.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, it's essential to understand that you are competing for an international scholarship, and students from all over the world are vying for this scholarship seat. Given this, universities have to establish timelines to provide equal opportunities to all students.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes but I have a query
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Sandra, go ahead, what query do you have on your mind?
20/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 267 7628: About this message food was included before application
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Sandra, to address this properly, I would like to revisit our conversation from yesterday, during which we discussed that this scholarship offer letter you have received is unique, and the cost of education it covers falls outside the usual range. 

The cost of education varies significantly from one university to another, and it's important to understand that this scholarship is specific to MVN University. The financial details provided in the offer letter are tailored to that university and are not applicable to other institutions and the earlier discussions done with you.

With that said, I would like to inquire if you recall this part of our discussion? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 12:18 am - +263 71 387 2209: Noted
26/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Sandra,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 387 2209: I am sorry was not able to connect with you I had an emergency to attend to
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sandra

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to check your message on Friday, by the time you replied, we were unavailable and hence couldn't attend to your message.
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I completely understand that you were not able to connect with us on Friday, your well-being is a top priority. Emergencies happen, and there is no need to worry. I am rather glad to hear from you, I hope everything is fine now?
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 387 2209: Yes ma'am
03/11/23, 1:09 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Sandra,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:12 am - +263 71 387 2209: Ok ma'am
03/11/23, 1:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Sandra, thank you for understanding and being available. As you are aware this week was a significant week for you and your family, as it marked the deadline for your university registration fee, and making this payment in a timely manner is imperative to secure your admission and scholarship.

In this regard, we would like to follow up with you. Have you successfully completed the payment? If so, we kindly request you to share the payment receipt with us. This will aid us in updating the university and ensuring a smooth admission process for you.
03/11/23, 1:15 am - +263 71 387 2209: Unfortunately 😔...I couldn't make it
03/11/23, 1:15 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am so sorry to hear that Sandra. I am curious to understand what occurred and what challenges you faced that prevented you from making the payment to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University?

If you could provide some insights into this, it would be greatly appreciated so that I can see what is the best possible way forward.
03/11/23, 1:17 am - +263 71 387 2209: My parents could not arrange such money in a short space of time. Even after the payment plan they were afraid they would not be able to get the balance within a month
03/11/23, 1:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Sandra, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. It's clear that your parents were facing challenges arranging the required funds within the given timeframe, even with the payment plan. I can imagine how crucial this scholarship opportunity is to you.
03/11/23, 1:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Missing the set deadlines does pose a risk to your scholarship, and I share your concerns. I am curious to know if your parents have discussed any alternative plans or solutions to address this situation. What are their thoughts on how to proceed in securing your scholarship seat now?
03/11/23, 1:27 am - +263 71 387 2209: Well as said before they work in remote areas so we have not been able to connect with them for a while now but they do not have any plans in mind but are waiting to hear from you
03/11/23, 1:29 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update, and I understand that it may be challenging to connect with your parents in remote areas. At the same time, it is good to know that they are waiting to hear from us. We will work on finding a suitable solution and ensure we explore all options to help you secure your scholarship seat.
03/11/23, 1:29 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Since you mentioned their concern about the second installment of the payment plan, can I assume that they were able to raise the first part of your university registration fee, which is $425, by now?
03/11/23, 1:33 am - +263 71 387 2209: The main challenge is that my father is currently having challenges with his account numbers at work so he has not gotten his salary for the past 4 months so it is really challenging for us right now but once everything is ok I guess it will be better. Once again they were worried about the money for Food
03/11/23, 1:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand the challenges your family is currently facing, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. Financial difficulties can be tough, but we are here to assist in finding solutions. It is good to hear that once the issues with your father's salary are resolved, things will improve.

In this situation, I would like to enquire about the registration fee your family has been able to secure so far, considering they have been preparing for the registration fee since enrolling in the Edoofa program? This will help us better understand your current financial situation and discuss the next steps, including addressing concerns about food.
03/11/23, 1:37 am - +263 71 387 2209: Which one ma'am I don't understand
03/11/23, 1:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I did not get your question Sandra, can you please come again and help me understand it well so that I can address the same from a better perspective?
03/11/23, 1:41 am - +263 71 387 2209: Ok I was saying...I also did not understand here
03/11/23, 1:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, let me help you rephrase my message. What I wanted to know is, since you've been part of the Edoofa program and have been preparing to pay your registration fee, how much of that fee have you and your family managed to secure up to this point? This information will help us better understand your current financial situation and assist in planning the next steps for your university admission.
03/11/23, 1:45 am - +263 71 387 2209: Currently we are at zero maam
03/11/23, 1:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Sandra. In such a situation, I would like to know how you and your family have been preparing for your university admission. Our concern is that you've already missed some due dates. While we're here to help you overcome these challenges and secure your scholarship seat, we also need to align our solutions with the university's expectations. To do that, we need to know your plan for moving forward. 

I hope you can appreciate the importance of this for your scholarship, university admission and your higher education plans?
03/11/23, 2:23 am - +263 71 387 2209: Since my admission is in August 2024... We thought this when we would be fully prepared
03/11/23, 2:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand your perspective, Sandra, and it's clear that you were planning to be fully prepared for your admission in August 2024. However, I would like to provide some additional context. When a student applies for regular admission, the processing typically aligns with the academic intake commencement. This timeline might work well for regular students and is what you have on your mind.
03/11/23, 2:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in your case, securing a scholarship in India, especially a high quantum scholarship, is a unique opportunity. These international scholarships are highly competitive since the students all over the world are applying, and seats are limited. Therefore, the earlier you initiate your admission process and secure your scholarship seat, the better your chances of success.
03/11/23, 2:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: If you choose to wait longer, you run the risk of missing out on the high quantum scholarship, as most seats may already be filled. This could also affect the additional financial benefits offered under the endowment plan, which may no longer be available. 

Since the due date for your scholarship seat was on October 31 and it has been three days, there's still an opportunity for us to discuss this with the university, ensuring you not only secure your high quantum scholarship but are also avail the endowment benefits.
03/11/23, 2:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: While you can still take admission later in the year, you might lose your scholarship and endowment benefits. I believe this isn't the outcome you as a family hope for?
03/11/23, 4:10 am - +263 71 387 2209: Yes it isnt
10/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 267 7628: Good morning may you please resend the messages they are all waiting messages
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Sandra!
I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 08:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead.
17/11/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sandra!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sandra!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 326 7915: We are ready but the only problem was that of $1000 US within ba short period of time. We failed to make it.
23/11/23, 8:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, don't you think that if you won't have any discussion with me here and will continue not to respond, it will only make it hard for you to plan the steps ahead?

I believe it would be better for us to have a proper discussion on the same so that we can plan the next steps and make sure how you would be able to complete the registration?
23/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 326 7915: Let's discuss.
23/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your willingness to discuss, Sandra. Given the time and considering that my working hours are coming to an end for today, I suggest we continue our conversation tomorrow at 01:00 PM. This will allow us ample time to delve deeper into your concerns regarding the registration fee payment and strategize the best way forward for your registration. I hope you are okay with that? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Noted
24/11/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sandra! I hope this message finds you well.

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 326 7915: Good afternoon we can continue
24/11/23, 7:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, Sandra, since you had mentioned that you are finding it hard to raise the $1000, on that note, shall we go ahead and discuss a solution to that please?
24/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 326 7915: Yes we can go ahead
24/11/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, since you have mentioned that you found it hard to raise the $1000 as is, can you please let me know how much amount were you able to raise till now for the registration fee?
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 326 7915: Actually I thought since her intake is in August next year l have got enough time to gather the money. I didn't think it's urgent.
24/11/23, 9:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. I get that, however, I belive you had discussed the same with your admission officer when you had a conversation about the Endowment Plan Benefits, right?
24/11/23, 11:22 pm - +263 77 267 7628: Yes
25/11/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sandra!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
25/11/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you recall the discussion that you had with the admission officer about the Endowment Plan Benefits. About that, I wanted to let you know that if you wish to complete the admission process later on, in that case you would lose on the Benefits as well as the $150 Grant. How do you want to work with that?
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sandra!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Milan Edoofa: It's been over three days since we last connected regarding your offer letter and the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, however, since I did not get any response from your side I was concerned about the same. 

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
