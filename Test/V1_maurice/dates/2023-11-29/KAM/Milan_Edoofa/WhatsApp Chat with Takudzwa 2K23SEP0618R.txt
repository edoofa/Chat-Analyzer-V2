Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes we are available
19/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 925 2560: I am through with it
19/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
19/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes they were clear
19/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 925 2560: But I did not get the list of universities that were under the EDOOFA program
19/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's correct; the list of affiliated colleges is quite extensive, encompassing various esteemed universities. Here are a few prominent ones among the many institutions we have affiliations with:

Sure, here's a brief context for each university:

Lovely Professional University (LPU):
A leading private university known for its comprehensive academic programs, modern infrastructure, and emphasis on experiential learning.

Galgotias University:
Renowned for its focus on research, innovation, and industry-oriented education, nurturing future professionals across various disciplines.

Gulzar Group of Institutions:
Committed to providing quality education and holistic development, fostering a conducive learning environment for students to excel in their chosen fields.

Quest Group of Institutions:
Dedicated to shaping future leaders through a blend of academic excellence, skill development, and exposure to real-world challenges.

MVN University:

19/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are on the same page here
19/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes we are on the same page
19/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes I  am following
19/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/09/23, 10:02 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Good among these universities is there any other universities either the once which are not private. From the list above LPU is best from the above list. May you add some  more LPU is number 38 in India
19/09/23, 10:03 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Galgotias university is number 203
19/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes they clear
19/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Universities are subject to frequent ranking updates, and the rankings displayed on websites can vary.

25/09/23, 8:19 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Good evening
25/09/23, 8:19 pm - +27 83 778 4816: We are doing well.

25/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Good day how are you Sir <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 925 2560: For the first video .One should be open minded and also one should be creative .Secondly you must follow instructions
25/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 925 2560: For the second video.EDOOFA creates scholarships places for students around the wolrd mainy in African countries. These scholarships are nor just ordinary scholarships but they provide you  internship opportunities where by you will be tought to be competitive in the Today world
25/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 925 2560: For the third video . Most of the content was about the Universities , saying that EDOOFA is in partnership with the quite a number of the best Universities offering scholarships to unverities with high standard . They also stated the Universities use English as their language of communication for students to understand during lessons
25/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 925 2560: For the last video. It stated about that Edoofa helps you with the statement of purpose and how impotant it is for a student
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
\
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
25/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 925 2560: Yes we are on the same page
25/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
25/09/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 7:30 PM.
25/09/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 8:30 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Alright you will only submit application to those university which work with Edoofa.
12/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Exactly. We will strategically submit your application to universities that have a partnership with Edoofa and are recognized by our Academic Board. This ensures that you have genuine and viable options for higher education. It's important to focus on universities that align with your academic and career goals.

Furthermore, we will assist you in reviewing the offer letters and making an informed decision based on factors like scholarship amount, educational expenses, location, and other relevant criteria. Our goal is to guide you towards the best-fit university for your studies and aspirations.
12/10/23, 8:50 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Alright for this program he wish to take, may you tell us some of the universities. We have been checking on Google , we have seen over 500 institution. My wish is for him to get a University not a College
12/10/23, 9:02 pm - +27 83 778 4816: The universities fees  , since it's for a year. Do you not  have part payment.
12/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I understand your preference for universities over colleges. In the field of Pharmacy, there are several reputable universities that are known for their strong programs and research in this domain. However, as we are partnered with more than 250+ universities, it will be hard for me to go through all of them. So, I am sharing the top universities that we are currently associated with:

1. Lovely Professional University
2. Galgotias University
3. Gulzar Group of Institutes
4. MVN University
5. Quest Group of Institutes <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 9:06 pm - +27 83 778 4816: But we are looking at B. Pharm universities
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - +27 83 778 4816: LPU I know it. It's  good university.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - +27 83 778 4816: What about Chandigarh university is it not on your list.
12/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed please excuse me for the error.
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - +27 83 778 4816: My wish is a university not other type of institution
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely Takudzwa will be provided with an offer Lett from a few of our top universities. So in light to your recent concern I am really happy to to know that you have a good knowledge about Indian universities so may I know how do you come acy Chandigarh University
12/10/23, 9:25 pm - +27 83 778 4816: I do not know much. When I read about it. It's like it take more student from Africa. Also on India  rating on B. Pharm it's lower than LPU but it's good also
12/10/23, 9:28 pm - +27 83 778 4816: LPU it is at the top, although I heard that it's fees is high but we will
12/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, LPU is the better option here. I would like to let you know that there have been recent cases at Chandigarh University where the incident was not reported properly, concerning a female student being recorded without consent in the hostels by her roommates. Unless and until safety and privacy are guaranteed, we are currently not associated with the university, and hence we do not want our students to get enrolled in the same.
12/10/23, 9:48 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Okay those are some of the issues we do not know about
12/10/23, 9:49 pm - +27 83 778 4816: This one I doubt if you work with them Panjab university
12/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is indeed true, as it is not widely shown on the internet unless you specifically search for it. As we prioritize offering the best care and safety for your Edofians, unless and until an institution/university is proven safe for your students, we do not share your applications with them. So, may I know if you are clear here?
12/10/23, 9:58 pm - +27 83 778 4816: On my wish list not knowing much about the other incidents. I had LPU. Panjab,  Panjab central,, Armity, annamala, Dibrugarh, Nirmar, Shoolini, Parul chandigarh, Galgotias
12/10/23, 10:01 pm - +27 83 778 4816: You are very clear and we understand as well. Edoofa to me you are the second parents to students under your program
12/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. Since it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope you have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
12/10/23, 10:07 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Same to you, Thank you.
12/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Good evening
13/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Shall we procced further with the session?
13/10/23, 8:58 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Alright
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. May I now if you are clear with our recent conversations?
13/10/23, 9:05 pm - +27 83 778 4816: You are clear and we understand
13/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now with further continuation. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 9:18 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Correct
13/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Yes we are on the same page
13/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
13/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
13/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
13/10/23, 9:30 pm - +27 83 778 4816: How often does the fees will increase
13/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The fees will be constant throughout the career and will not be increased once you have received and accepted the offer letter. May I know if you are clear on this?
13/10/23, 9:35 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Very clear
13/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
13/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM. Have a great day ahead!
13/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the mean time. Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Takudzwa EWYL23E0662*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GE1rjWKwn1TKqL89QfAhy2"
13/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Takudzwa Kayden Jongwe and my EWYL group name is Takudzwa EWYL23E0662.* I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
13/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
14/10/23, 8:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Dear parents and Takudzwa. 

How are you doing this lovely weekend?
14/10/23, 8:18 am - +27 83 778 4816: Good morning
14/10/23, 8:19 am - +27 83 778 4816: Sorry yesterday I just slept without notifying.
14/10/23, 8:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, If you are ready now shall we proceed with the session?
14/10/23, 8:30 am - +27 83 778 4816: This message was deleted
14/10/23, 8:31 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i am ready
14/10/23, 8:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 8:40 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i have question. How much roughly does a visa cost. For flight I know the price change oftenly depends with time.
14/10/23, 8:43 am - +27 83 778 4816: Right now he is  writing examination. These results are they not required when you are submitting the application.
14/10/23, 8:45 am - +27 83 778 4816: Thank you i am with you.
14/10/23, 8:49 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the question, and it's an important aspect to consider in your planning. As of now, the student visa fee for studying in India is approximately $83. 

Regarding flight expenses, you're absolutely correct; they can vary based on a variety of factors including the time of booking, season, airline, and other factors. Generally, flights for international travel from your country to India can range anywhere from $400 to $600, but this is subject to change. It's wise to monitor flight prices and book at a time that's most suitable and affordable for you.
14/10/23, 8:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noted that as well and we will be discussing it in our session soon. Shall we proceed?
14/10/23, 8:56 am - +27 83 778 4816: The visa and flight it's 600 roughly
14/10/23, 8:57 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes we can proceed.
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:08 am - +27 83 778 4816: I have seen it. One day my Takudzwa Kayden will be one of the celebrating Edoofian.
14/10/23, 9:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/10/23, 9:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/10/23, 9:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
14/10/23, 9:20 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i am ready
14/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

14/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

14/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
14/10/23, 9:22 am - +27 83 778 4816: I have a question. Sorry for that. How often do student come back home visit. Is it allowed to visit especially on holidays.
14/10/23, 9:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize, your questions are important! Students studying in India do have opportunities to visit their home countries during holidays. Typically, universities in India have scheduled breaks aligned with major holidays and academic calendars. These breaks provide students the chance to return home and spend time with their families.

It's generally allowed for students to travel during these breaks, and they can plan their visits accordingly.
14/10/23, 9:30 am - +27 83 778 4816: I understand. I am the parent , I am not the one who is writing the examination and who going to study. My major role as bread winner is to provide. And I thank by helping me on making it easy for to provide.
14/10/23, 9:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that as well, if you re ready shall we  start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan?
14/10/23, 9:32 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes let's start.
14/10/23, 9:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 9:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 9:41 am - +27 83 778 4816: That's great. I am happy to hear this.
14/10/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 9:56 am - +27 83 778 4816: Thank you. These benefits are wonderful.
14/10/23, 9:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 9:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 10:00 am - +27 83 778 4816: This is great, I have been saved.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 10:02 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i am with you.
14/10/23, 10:35 am - +27 83 778 4816: I do not have any thing to ask. I understand and I am following everything into details..
14/10/23, 10:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 10:40 am - +27 83 778 4816: May you provide more information on it.
14/10/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/10/23, 10:49 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes  you are clear and I understand
14/10/23, 10:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 10:53 am - +27 83 778 4816: I do not think he will get  such a lower mark (E)
14/10/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, he will be able to get more marks. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 11:09 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i understand.
14/10/23, 11:16 am - +27 83 778 4816: Me, I am focusing on the normal process. He is going to pass. He is going to be with you there in India.
14/10/23, 11:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that will happen.
14/10/23, 11:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 11:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 11:44 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes i understand and you are very clear.
14/10/23, 11:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 11:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 11:46 am - +27 83 778 4816: No I do not have questions. We can move forward.
14/10/23, 11:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Takudzwa's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Takudzwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
14/10/23, 11:50 am - +27 83 778 4816: Yes , yes we are looking forward to receive the offer letter which the next step.
14/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Takudzwa's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
14/10/23, 12:14 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Thank you.
17/10/23, 11:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa,

18/10/23, 11:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa,

18/10/23, 12:19 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Thank you i have seen this.
18/10/23, 12:21 pm - +27 83 778 4816: However Mvn university I  can not see it even on India universities ranking. Is it the only university which offer us a place.
18/10/23, 12:24 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Mostly a degree from a recognized university is valuable. So MVN university I did not see it at all may you help me on that.
18/10/23, 12:25 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Then we go to the fees , how much per year are we going to pay.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @27837784816 and I am glad to know that you were able to go through the offer letter. Also, I completely understand that everyone needs their rest. We are just as thrilled and excited about the journey ahead.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, it is good to see that you are taking the time to thoroughly review the offer letter. The well-being and future of your child are of paramount importance. Rest assured, that we are here to help you feel confident about the choice you make for your child's education.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To address the query highlighted by you, let me tell you that MVN University is one of the leading universities for Pharmacy and this is the first university that has accepted Takduzwa's application for a scholarship. 

It is a significant achievement for him. He has been awarded a prestigious 75% scholarship on his tuition fee, and his accommodation fee has been 100% sponsored.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: We will have a detailed conversation regarding the same offer letter and guide you through the admission process and the per-annum fee breakup. 

To ensure we can discuss the offer letter thoroughly and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly confirm if you will be available to connect with us today in the evening at 07:30 PM?
20/10/23, 10:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Takudzwa,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regards to our messages from Tuesday and Wednesday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from MVN University. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 10:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, we have not heard from your end since then, and as a result, I have been awaiting your response so that we can discuss your offer letter, help you complete your university admission formalities, and move forward to the next stage in your journey to India. Hence, could you please confirm if you have had the opportunity to review my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 11:00 am - +27 83 778 4816: No MVN  let's consider others
20/10/23, 11:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @27837784816 and I understand your concerns and your preference for having options from other universities. However, sir, in cases where you receive an offer from a particular institution you are not familiar with, it's essential for you to explore the same option, and understand the details so that you can make the best choice for your child's education. We certainly appreciate your honesty and your desire to ensure your child's future education aligns with your expectations.
20/10/23, 11:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time @27837784816, I am sure you are aware that Edoofa has over 14 years of experience in the education sector. During this time, we have identified reputable universities that provide quality education while also considering affordability. If you feel that the university you received an offer from doesn't meet your expectations, I suggest connecting with us to have a discussion and gain more insights.
20/10/23, 11:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Rather, if you believe your assumptions are sufficient to make a decision, it might not be the best course of action. It is crucial to explore the offer and get a clearer understanding. Please keep in mind that the offer letters have an associated due date of 31st October. Missing this deadline may result in the university not considering Takudzwa's application further. It's a critical decision, and hence, once again all I can do is encourage you to discuss it further with the team to make an informed choice.
20/10/23, 11:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, as we shared with you on Wednesday, this is the first offer letter that Takudzwa has received. To understand how the admission process is carried out and when you can expect another offer letter, it's crucial for you to have a discussion with the team and gain a clear understanding of the process. Only then can you see the bigger picture.
20/10/23, 11:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: @27837784816, please don't take this the wrong way, but if you re not open to listening to the team, in the end, it will be Takudzwa who could potentially be at a loss. As a parent, I am sure this is not something you wish for. It is essential to make well-informed decisions for your child's education, and the Edoofa team is here to provide guidance and support to ensure the best outcomes for Takudzwa.
20/10/23, 12:05 pm - +27 83 778 4816: No man if you check on India rankings you can not see it which means it out. The issue of discount it can not push me to take a lower ranking university. Right now where he learn per term I pay 730 USD per year which is 2190 USD. And MVN their fees per year is 2250 USD which is almost the same as the one I am paying. MVN university it's a lower ranking university let's move to the other one.
20/10/23, 12:35 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Let's consider the likes of LPU, Amity ,Nirma, Shoolini, Panjab  central, Panjab, Galgotias, Parul, GLA. You have plenty Universities you are working with, let's hear from other universities MVN  I say No. A big NO.
20/10/23, 12:43 pm - +27 83 778 4816: I did not want to tell you directly that I do not consider MVN.
20/10/23, 5:50 pm - +27 83 778 4816: This message was deleted
20/10/23, 7:25 pm - +27 83 778 4816: This message was deleted
20/10/23, 7:26 pm - +27 83 778 4816: Me i am looking at a University, if you check on Google you will be to see it. Also if you check on India rankings you will be able to see it somewhere THERE. if you Check LPU, Galgotias Amity Nirma on workd ranking you can see them. This MVN you do not see it anywhere being in India or world ranking. A Degree from a lower ranking university it's a problem on the market. We have such Universities here in Africa  , you get a degree and do nothing with it. I am not looking for such to happen to Takudzwa Kayden. Let's try other Universities which are known. I can not send my child to India for sake of being abroad and bring a degree without value. NO.
22/10/23, 6:08 am - +27 83 778 4816: If we go to Google and say " India universities ranking in B.Pharm or all India universities and their ranking. Also world universities ranking in B.Pharm. You can not see this MVN university on all of the platform. This university is not yet being rated either in India or on world ranking. We do not leave in a vacuum and the qualifications he is going to get he will use them in this world. Where he is going get the qualifications should be a recognized university.

I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 8:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*.
