I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. So I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us today and move forward with our discussion?
03/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Milton.

I hope this message finds you well. I have been wanting to connect with you to carry forward Milton's admission process ahead for his higher education in India, and it has been a long time since we did not hear back from you. 

I noticed that you were able to go through my messages, and hence I feel something has been bothering you because of which you have not been active in your admission group. If I may ask, may I know what happened? Have you been facing some kind of challenges?
03/08/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Good afternoon we were researching well so as to complete the task very well but lam sure by the end of the day l will share the screen short and submit the form

04/08/23, 6:14 am - +263 77 249 8595: The law of demand states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. In other words, there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

Demand forecasting is the process of estimating the future demand for a product or service. It involves analyzing past data, market trends, consumer behavior, and other relevant factors to make predictions about future demand levels. This forecasting aids businesses in making informed decisions regarding production, inventory management, pricing, and resource allocation.

Example of demand forecasting:
Let's consider a smartphone manufacturer. To forecast demand for their upcoming model, the manufacturer would analyze factors such as the previous sales performance of similar products, market trends, consumer preferences, and any new technological advancements. Based on this analysis, they may predict a certain level of demand for the new smartphone.

Suppose the manufacturer estimates that the price of the new smartphone will be $800. Using the law of demand, they anticipate that the quantity demanded may be 10,000 units per month. However, if they lower the price to $700, they may expect an increase in demand to 15,000 units per month. This forecasted demand can guide the manufacturer in determining the appropriate pricing strategy, production capacity, and marketing efforts to meet customer demand and maximize sales.

Demand forecasting allows businesses to align their production and supply chain activities with expected demand levels, reducing the risk of overproduction or stockouts. It also helps in optimizing resource allocation and inventory management, ensuring that the right amount of products or services are available at the right time to meet customer needs.
04/08/23, 6:14 am - +263 77 249 8595: Outsourcing, which refers to the practice of contracting work to an external organization or overseas firm, can have both positive and negative effects on the economy.

Positive impacts of outsourcing on the economy:
1. Cost reduction: Outsourcing can lead to cost savings for companies as they can take advantage of lower labor costs in other countries. This, in turn, can result in lower prices for consumers and increased consumer spending, stimulating economic growth.
2. Access to specialized skills and expertise: Outsourcing provides the opportunity to access specialized skills and expertise that may not be available domestically. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in industries.
3. Job creation: While outsourcing may result in the outsourcing of certain jobs, it can also create new job opportunities. For example, companies that outsource certain tasks may use the saved resources to invest in innovative areas, leading to job creation in new industries.

Negative impacts of outsourcing on the economy:
1. Job losses: One of the most significant criticisms of outsourcing is that it can result in the loss of domestic jobs, particularly in industries where labor is outsourced overseas. This can lead to increased unemployment rates and an adverse impact on communities and workers.
2. Wage depression: Outsourcing to countries with lower wages can put downward pressure on domestic wages in certain industries. As a result, workers may face wage stagnation or even a decline in their earnings.
3. Economic dependence and vulnerability: Relying heavily on outsourcing can make an economy vulnerable to external factors such as political instability or labor disputes in the outsourcing destinations. This can lead to disruptions in the supply chain and negatively impact domestic businesses.

It's important to note that the impact of outsourcing can vary across industries and nations. The net effect on the economy depends on various factors, including the context, industry-specific dynamics, and overall economic policies in place.
04/08/23, 6:14 am - +263 77 249 8595: The currency exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market through the forces of supply and demand. There are several factors that influence the supply and demand for currencies, including economic indicators, interest rates, political stability, inflation rates, and market sentiment.

When there is a high demand for a currency, its value tends to rise in relation to other currencies. This is because buyers are willing to pay more of their own currency to acquire the desired currency. On the other hand, when there is a high supply of a currency, its value tends to decrease. Sellers are willing to accept less of their currency in exchange for another currency.

The foreign exchange market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, across different financial centers around the world. The market participants, including banks, corporations, governments, and individual traders, actively buy and sell currencies based on their expectations of future currency movements.

For example, if an investor believes that the value of the Japanese yen will appreciate against the US dollar, they may demand more yen and sell dollars. This increase in demand for yen can lead to the yen strengthening against the dollar in the foreign exchange market.

Central banks also play a significant role in determining currency exchange rates. They can intervene in the market by buying or selling currencies to stabilize their own currency or manage economic conditions. Interest rate decisions by central banks can affect currency values as well, as higher interest rates attract foreign investors seeking higher returns, increasing demand for the currency.

Overall, the currency exchange rate in the foreign exchange market is determined by the interaction of various economic factors and the actions of market participants, reflecting the relative strength and performance of different economies.

14/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
14/08/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Economics for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
14/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes sir
14/08/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Noted
14/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
14/08/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Pleasure
14/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
14/08/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes
14/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
14/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
14/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes
14/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
14/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
14/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
14/08/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes sure
14/08/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
14/08/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes sir
14/08/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
14/08/23, 11:00 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Clear and understoodable
14/08/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 11:22 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Understood
14/08/23, 11:22 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes am following sir
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Milton.

I hope you are doing well, since it was a National Holiday, hence we could not connect with you earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes am available
16/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yessiah
16/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 128 1051: No queries understoodable
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:00 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Milton.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Sorry for late responding
06/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Milton.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you and on the weekend the team is not available. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes lam available
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you were able to go through the benefits by now?
06/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes
06/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Milton's, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Noted with thanks

06/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document, it is noted with us. Now moving ahead with the next point. 

*2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263772498595 may I know if we are still connected?
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Noted

06/11/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/11/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772498595 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Noted
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes  but l think it's network
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that network can be a challenge. Now moving ahead 

*4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 5:15 am - +263 77 249 8595: Noted
07/11/23, 5:17 am - +263 77 249 8595: Nothing to inquire about noted

07/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes connected
07/11/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 249 8595: You can provide me with more information on the little l have
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement

07/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Iam clear now thank you
07/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 249 8595: That's true
07/11/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 128 1051: I agreee
07/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Yes ma'am
07/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Noted ma'am
07/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Understood
07/11/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 128 1051: No ma'am
07/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 128 1051: Very excited ma'am and thank you for your contribution
07/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

18/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Pardon
18/11/23, 7:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?

18/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Noted ma'am
18/11/23, 8:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Olk ma'am
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Iam clear
18/11/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Milton, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.

I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.

I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting your acknowledgment to proceed with our discussion earlier yesterday, however, since I did not receive one, we could not move ahead with our discussion here. 

May I know if we can move ahead with our conversation here now?
21/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Afternoon yes we can proceed

21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Yes you can explain
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milton!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
22/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 249 8595: Yes we can cannect
22/11/23, 9:33 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, before we proceed, may I know if you are clear till here as well so that we can move ahead?
22/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 249 8595: I would like you to explain for me the advantages l granted through Endowment plan
22/11/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 249 8595: Thank you
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Milton!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
24/11/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Milton!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/11/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter and proceed with the next steps in your admission journey.

24/11/23, 6:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How have you been doing lately?
