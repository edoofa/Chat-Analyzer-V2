I  wanted to confirm if you have earlier intake before August so that I could shift from August intake to an earlier intake
07/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, all the universities in India start their intake in the month of August as a procedure that they have to follow. If you are clear shall we proceed with the session?

08/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Hello Sir I am back
08/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Good Evening  Sir
08/09/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear. May I know if you are ready to proceed?
08/09/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Evening How are you 

Yes Sir I am ready
09/09/23, 10:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely afternoon. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
09/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 345 4513: Greetings How are you Sir 

Yes I am ready
09/09/23, 11:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/09/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 345 4513: Ok Sir
09/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 345 4513: My understanding on the forth stage is that the  Admission team  will process my university application documents to the Universities in India  and when accepted the offer letter will be given
09/09/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
09/09/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 345 4513: I am not aware Sir. Kindly share the exciting news with me
09/09/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Diana, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
09/09/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
09/09/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes Sir this is exciting ...it will relieve my parents a lot ..Thank you so much Sir
09/09/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
09/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes I wish to know more
09/09/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
09/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 345 4513: This message was deleted
09/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 345 4513: I wasn't aware Sir
09/09/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as an unforseen work that just came up. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconvene on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
09/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Greetings Sir ...yes we are having a wonderful afternoon thanks for asking ..I wish you too a fantastic weekend
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as it was a long weekend and I was occupied with unforeseen work. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
13/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Good Afternoon Sir 
..How are you
13/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes I am available
13/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
13/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I have gone through them Sir
13/09/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
13/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes Sir it is clear
13/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. That is wonderful to hear, dear. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.

Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.

Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
13/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Understood  Sir 

We are on the same page
13/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
13/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I understood Sir
13/09/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 17th September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 17th September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 17th October 2023. Any queries so far?
13/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 295 6517: No queries sir
13/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
13/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 295 6517: There are no doubts or queries .We can proceed
13/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And let us connect this evening at 7:30 PM
13/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Ok Sir noted 
I will discuss with them
14/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Diana. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 295 6517: We are fine sir and how are you
14/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes we had a conversation
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
14/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 295 6517: The discussion on the Early Decision was  very interesting and my parents have appreciated the reduction and they are willing to pay the balance in due course
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
14/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes they are available Sir
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Helo sir lam Diana's mother. I  really appreciate   all the procedures towards my child's path  for her education.
14/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I read and understood what you said regarding Early decision benefit.  To me it's a   blessing.
14/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Thank you Mrs. Enita. It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I am  prepared for
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I am aware of that
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
14/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes sir
14/09/23, 10:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 10:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
14/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 295 6517: You can proceed
14/09/23, 10:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 3rd of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes sir
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, the deadline becomes the 3rd of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 3rd of October 2023, making the second deadline the 3rd of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
14/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Understood Sir
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Well elaborated
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
14/09/23, 11:04 pm - +263 77 295 6517: The universities are very strict on their deadline. Once you miss the due date, your offer letter is provoked.  For the issue  to the university  admission process. There are two ways , the standard procedure and the Early decision benefit. The parents or sponsors will   take   what they want  according to their financial ability
14/09/23, 11:06 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I would prefer the second option . Early decision benefit
14/09/23, 11:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
14/09/23, 11:10 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes sir that's why l said will opt for   Early Decision benefit
14/09/23, 11:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
14/09/23, 11:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *3rd October* and *3rd November*.
14/09/23, 11:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Diana’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 11:14 pm - +263 77 295 6517: You can proceed sir.
14/09/23, 11:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you Mrs. Enita. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps? <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 11:16 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I will not let you down
14/09/23, 11:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Diana’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Diana’s higher education well.
14/09/23, 11:18 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Thank you for the updates
03/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
03/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have today at 01.00 PM CAT. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
03/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 345 4513: Good morning Sir ...I hope you are doing well
03/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 345 4513: Thank you Sir this is wonderful news
03/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 345 4513: I will be available  at 1:00 PM
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Diana!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Afternoon Sir ...yes we were able to go through the offer letter ..I am available but my parent is not available now she is at work
03/10/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, we can discuss the offer letter for now with each other here. Now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Okay Sir
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please do that dear.
03/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 345 4513: 1 ....it's $900 
2....5 years (10semesters)
3.....$300
4.....$750
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
03/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes sir I understand
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Okay Sir I understand
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 345 4513: We are together
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes it's clear
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
03/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 345 4513: It is clear
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 17th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 17th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *17th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Ok sir
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes I am residing in Harare
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Okay Sir thank you  I understand
03/10/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
03/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes that is correct 

Kindly share them Sir
03/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
03/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Thank you Sir
03/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 345 4513: I will inform my mother about the discussion of the fees since she is not available
03/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can do that. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
03/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Thank you Sir . It is all clear
03/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes ,clear sir
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from the university. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other here for the same?
05/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Good Afternoon Sir
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today Diana?
05/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 345 4513: I am doing very well Sir and you
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine too dear, thank you for asking. Before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 345 4513: My mother is not available now Sir
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Yes I am Clear Sir
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 345 4513: My parents are in rural
05/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 345 4513: I don't have issues now Sir ..but my parents are away ..We can move

06/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I have a challenge   now . Which needs your  attention.  From all the conversation we did . The 50 percentage was not tagged for tuition only .  Or else the examples were not clear  for me
06/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 295 6517: The examples were given as let's say your  amount is 2500 or 3000 . The scholarship will offer 50 percentage. Which will amount to 1500 or less.
06/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 295 6517: These were from my previous conversation
06/10/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you must have had a misunderstanding about the process. Let me help you get a clarity on that here. 

The cost of education here in India is around $6000-8000 per annum. Now with the help of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you are guaranteed to get a scholarship of around 50% please. This means that after the scholarship the cost of education comes down to $2000-3000 per annum, I hope this is clear now?
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes
06/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
11/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 295 6517: That Diana's mother
11/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 295 6517: We started talking on Friday
11/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 295 6517: You were talking to me not Diana  sir
11/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 295 6517: It's good news for sure . The   tuition  is quite  reasonable bt  accomodation  and food  has ruined my  pocket. I had wrong  calculations pertaining the  figures. However still thinking how to make ends meet
12/10/23, 12:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 10:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
13/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 295 6517: If possible Sunday .
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now?
15/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Good evening sir
15/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes
15/10/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
15/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes l did
15/10/23, 9:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 295 6517: $900
10 semesters
300
750
15/10/23, 10:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes
15/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I'm failing to understand the   figures sir. Total cost of the course  per  annum is 2800
1800 tution
200 exam fee
Accomodations eg. 3 seater  is 2000. Total  4000 per annum
15/10/23, 10:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. However, You can choose on-campus or off-campus accommodation based on your preference and budget. The total cost for the selected accommodation option will be added to your tuition and examination fees. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Ok Sir from the beginning we did wrong calculations . I  failed to work with figures well
15/10/23, 10:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine please, I understand. Now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead?
15/10/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Let's move on sir
15/10/23, 10:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:51 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Okay  sir
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:57 pm - +263 77 295 6517: You can proceed
15/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 11:08 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Fine
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 17th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 17th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *17th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we were having here earlier, I am sure that you have taken note that the deadline for making the payment of your registration fee is of today, hence, can you please share an update with me about the same that by when are you planning to make the payment please?
17/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 345 4513: Good morning Sir
17/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Yes sir  it's due date bt could not manage to pay because of Some reason s
17/10/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, can you please help me in understanding about how is it that you are planning to move ahead to complete the registration please?
17/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Sir you did very well. My worry is ahead. Am l going  to save for the accomodation. The  figures  are not  sounding well For me. For the tution am well prepared .
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand where you are coming from, and on that, note, I would like to mention that on-campus accommodation is quite expensive at Galgotias, and due to the same reason, most of the students who come to study at Galgotias prefer to choose off-campus accommodation, due to the flexibility as well as the affordability factor. This means that in only $800 per annum accommodation costs, you can make sure that Diana's higher education will be on the right track, I hope this is understood, right?
18/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Ok Sir do you mind if we can talk after 5 pm
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are ready to move ahead with the discussion please let me know.

19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I am sorry to hear that dear. How are you doing now, how are your siblings doing?
19/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 295 6517: We are on treatment sir thanks and how are you. We can discuss our issues
19/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 295 6517: We can continue if You're free
19/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. I hope that you would be completely fine soon. Moving ahead, I believe you recall that the deadline date for making the payment of your registration fee was of 17th October, in that case, since we are already 2 days past the deadline, can you please let me know how is it that you wish to complete your registration process?
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Since the due date is already past. I'm just waiting to hear from you
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, by when would you be able to make the payment at the earlier please?
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Are they no penalties
19/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that I will talk to the university officials on your behalf, however, for that, you would have to let me know by when will you be making the payment please?
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 295 6517: On Saturday  before 12.
I'm just working  now on the off campus sir.
19/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well dear, what are you working on right now?
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Sorry  for mixing issues.
19/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 295 6517: As for the registration   I will do the payments on Saturday
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I'm saying for accomodation   issues will opt for off campus sir
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, would it be possible for you to make the payment on Friday, i.e. tomorrow, since the university will be closed on Saturday and then I will only be able to discuss them on Monday, and this might cause an issue. I hope you understand?
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 295 6517: They are cheaper as compared to other changes
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Ok
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 295 6517: I have a question sir
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is it?
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 295 6517: Tution fee is $900 and registration fee is 750 though 150 has been slashed for early  registration.  How does it go. May  you elaborate on that one.
19/10/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, let me help you in understanding the same here. Now, on that note as you can see taht the reigstration fee is $750 and you have to pay $600 out of that and $150 is what we will pay. 

Moving ahead, once paid, the total amount of $750 will be adjsted in your first year fee, this means that the balance that will remain is:

$900 - $750 = $150

I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 295 6517: Good morning Sir
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Diana!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

20/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 295 6517: However lm working hard towards Diana 's higher education
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Diana!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding Diana's admission process.
