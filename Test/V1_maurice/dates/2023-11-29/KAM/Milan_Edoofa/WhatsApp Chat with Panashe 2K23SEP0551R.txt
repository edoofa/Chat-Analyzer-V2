For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
13/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir we can start
13/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I have gone through it sir you may proceed
13/09/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
13/09/23, 11:37 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
14/09/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Panashe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?

14/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am available
14/09/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/09/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir I am
14/09/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir they are clear
14/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Good evening sir

19/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to schedule our session for tomorrow at 4:00 PM tomorrow, I hope by that time you might be able to watch the videos. Have a great day ahead.
19/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Thank you sir
20/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Good evening sir
20/09/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Panashe,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
20/09/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am ready
20/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir I watched all of them
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
20/09/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 984 5767: May share my response in form of voice note am on my way from school
20/09/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright dear, you can do that as well.
20/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK thank you
20/09/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 984 5767: This message was deleted

20/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 179 6874: Fine Panashe s mother are the  family members  being involved  in these discussions  sir  conducts were given
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting. Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
20/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir we are
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 7:30 PM.
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Reason for short sightness or Myopia 
1.Genetics
2. Excessive time spent indoors 
3. Excessive close-vision work( such as working at a computer screen)
4. Excessive eye strain( caused by watching a bright television screen )

How can it be corrected 
Myopia treatment  carries in a number of options for prospective patients. In many cases, corrective lenses will be recommended. This may be in the form of prescription glasses or contact lenses and can greatly assist the individual in focusing their line of vision upon distant objects.In other cases,laser eye surgery can greatly assist patients in correcting their visual impairment. It is also important to note that your eyesight will alter with age.
21/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Panashe.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Lasik surgery 
I believe it is a medical corrective procedure that is used to treat myopia( short-sightedness),hyperopia( far-sightedness), and astigmatism ( blurriness in the vision).It is a medical surgery that corrects your reflective error to improve your vision .Lasik surgery may reduce your need for eyeglasses or contact lenses. In some cases ,it may even allow you to do without them completely. Yes it can be used with someone with retina defects while patients  who have resolved retina detachment may be suitable for laser eye surgery.
21/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Evening sir how are you ,am fine I am finishing up with the answers I was a bit occupied with school work
21/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Techniques to maintain good eyesight

Try the 20-20-20 rule.Every 20 minutes look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds. This short exercise can help reduce eye strain.It is also important to eat well,get enough sleep,quit smoking, wear sunglasses, look away from computer screen and visit your doctor regularly.
21/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 984 5767: What causes lazy eye syndrome, especially in kids

The lazy eye syndrome also known as Amblyopia is a type of poor vision that usually  happens  in just 1 eye but less common in both eyes.It develops when there's  a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together  and the brain can't recognise the sight from 1 of the eyes.Over time the brain realises more and more on the other ,stronger eye vision while vion in the weaker eye gets worse.

Amblyopia in children in Mostly caused by muscle imbalance ( astrabismus Amblyopia) in the muscle that position the eyes .This can change the nerve pathways between the retina at the back of the eye and the brain. This imbalance causes the eyes to cross in or turn out and prevent them from working together. 

Some eye conditions can also lead to Amblyopia. These include common vision problems like near- sightedness,far-sightedness, and astigmatism. It can also be caused by a difference in sharpness between the eyes, which is commonly known as refractive  Amblyopia .
21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

21/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK sir I will  share the documents  by tomorrow 7:30 pm
21/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait for the same.

22/09/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Am fine sir how are you am very excited for this weekend as this Saturday is my birthday
22/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and Happy Birthday in Advance, dear. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
22/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am ready ,thank you for the birthday wishes
22/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Optometry and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir its accurate
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am ready
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir I will have to choose  one of the universities
22/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir he did
22/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 984 5767: From this are you saying that the registration fee I would have paid for the university is subtracted from my first year tuition fees
22/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed. The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
22/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir now I understand
22/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/09/23, 12:23 am - +263 77 984 5767: This message was deleted
23/09/23, 12:23 am - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
25/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Panashe.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely evening?
25/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Am fine sir how are you
25/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 3:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Panashe EWYL23E0670*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/HAFUeGZRD7lCn8qLnirKAn"
26/09/23, 3:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Panashe Trinity Chiutsi and my EWYL group name is Panashe EWYL23E0670.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
26/09/23, 3:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
26/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Hello admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms.Ananya
26/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening Dear Parents and Panashe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
27/09/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Panashe!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
27/09/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Evening sir I am available now ,yesterday I faced network problems
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. thank you for letting me know. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am ready
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I have a question  on the tuition fee ,the 1800 is it per year or per semester how are the  school terms there ,how many are there per term
27/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 984 5767: What is the highest % offered for the scholarship
27/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, I shall help you here. For every year, every university has two semesters. The highest amount of scholarship offered by the universities is 100%.
27/09/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 984 5767: So is the 1800 for example per year or per semester
27/09/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is an example of a fee for a year.
27/09/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK thank you sir ,so is the remaining amount after the scholarship pays its part is it able to be paid in installments
27/09/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure let me help you here. The remaining amount has been elaborated with you after the implication of the scholarship.
27/09/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK sir
27/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting. May I know if you are clear do that we can proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 984 5767: May I know what helps one to get the highest % of the scholarship
27/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
28/09/23, 1:32 am - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
29/09/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Okay sir enjoy your weekend
03/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir am available
03/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Good evening sir how are you
03/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
03/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
03/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
03/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 984 5767: The last example you gave the tuition fee was 1800 if I may ask
03/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 984 5767: 2800 may be unaffordable for my parents
03/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is indeed correct. However if you go through the message it is mentioned for the tuition fees only and when you add in all the cost of education like food and accommodation it sums up to $2800, may I know if you are clear here ?
03/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
03/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
03/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
03/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Do I also buy the flight ticket and visa application
03/10/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, as the flight ticket and the visa fee come under the extra cost, they are to be borne by the student.
03/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 984 5767: May I know approximately how much is the flight ticket
03/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, the plane ticket will be range form $400 to $600 and the VISA fee would be $83
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Good evening sir yes am available
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 984 5767: They all seem excited sir
04/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
04/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

04/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
04/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
04/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
04/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

04/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
04/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir we may proceed
04/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 984 5767: What happens if the students wishes to withdraw from the program do they get a refund
04/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know why would like to withdraw your higher education program?
04/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I was just  asking  in case  my parents fail to pay the registration fees on time
04/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Am still continuing with my program but am afraid that the money needed for the program may be out of my parents' earnings
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK sir
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Am fine sir how are you
05/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes we shall
05/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of our recent conversation. Please do not worry about that right now. Your parents will be informed about the finances way in adncance so that they have a better preparation of the finanaces. In the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
05/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
05/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir its clear
05/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 984 5767: That's great news sir
05/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir I understand
05/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I understand everything sir
05/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Please elaborate more on it sir
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
05/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir it is definitely an added advantage
05/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes, sir they may pursue the diploma first, then bachelor after that's a better option if one is determined enough
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kidly excuse me for not being able to connect with you. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Right now am at school sir can I reschedule it for 17:00
09/10/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, dear. May I know if your parents are currently available to proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Unfortunately it is also during their work  hours, they can't be available
09/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please let me know when you are available so that we can proceed with the session.
09/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I am available now sir
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. 
Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 984 5767: That is also a better option sir
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 984 5767: That is also good sir
09/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 984 5767: No sir we may proceed
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK sir
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Unfortunately sir ,I am starting to write my final examinations next week can I be able to pause the sessions for now and continue after the exams
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, you can, please inform your parents so that they can be online any time for the session.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 984 5767: OK sir
14/10/23, 9:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe.

01/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I would be very grateful and excited to continue with the admission process but unfortunately my parents can't afford to pay for my fees so my hands are tied there nothing I can do am still in school and I can't pay for my own tuition fees

01/11/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me assure you that I'll do my best to assist you in finding potential solutions. However, for me to be able to do that, you would first have to help me in understanding about your plan to move ahead with the admission process and how do you wish to do that?

01/11/23, 10:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Panashe, that is why I wish to understand how are you planning to raise the finances for the same?
01/11/23, 11:17 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Unfortunately sir I have no way of raising the funds that is why I was withdrawing from the program
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, for a moment let us consider that you withdraw from the program, in that case, how would you be moving ahead with your higher education?

02/11/23, 8:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here dear. While considering studying at a local university, can you please let me know what would be the expenses for the same?

06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Evening sir how are you
07/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 179 6874: As Panashe s parents  we are not able to met the bills you have listed to be paid for our daughter for her education in your country
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 984 5767: We are no longer able to proceed with the admission process so we were wondering if we could get a refund of the admission fee we paid even 50% of it
07/11/23, 8:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here. Now, on that note, let us say that you do not wish to proceed with Edoofa for Panashe's higher education, in that case if you are planning to choose a local university, even then the costs would be quite high, then how are you planning to cope up with that?
07/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 984 5767: In the local colleges half of the amount is payed in local currency then the other half is paid with USD and here if your nationality is Zimbabwean you can study without paying the full amount and one can pay as they proceed
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. However, as you have mentioned that half of the amount is paid in local currency, even then, the total amount would remain the same, right?
07/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 984 5767: Yes sir
07/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 179 6874: Local university we will make payment plans for an agreed period  for Panashe s higher education
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, have you also checked about how much are the costs of local education?
07/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 179 6874: We will check soon after she finishes her exams
07/11/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I do get that, however, I wanted to know about the total costs of local education.
15/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!
I hope you're doing well.

15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. In that case, if I say that you can pursue your higher education here in India as well within the same costs or even lower, what would be your reaction to that?
15/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 984 5767: I would be very happy to hear that
