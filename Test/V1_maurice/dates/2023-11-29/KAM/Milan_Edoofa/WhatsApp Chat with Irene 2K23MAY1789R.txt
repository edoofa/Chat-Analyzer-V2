07/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Irene,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Irene's higher education?
07/09/23, 3:33 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good afternoon ma'am.
I'm very pleased to hear from you again 🙂

I hope you have taken note of our operational hours?
07/09/23, 10:10 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am, however I'm currently writing my preliminary exams and I start from 8am-1pm so I wouldn't have access to my phone until after the exam
07/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, we can connect during the night. Now, I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024.

I went to my school's office for the statement of entry and they don't know what that is. 
Is there perhaps a way I can explain to them? 
Apologies for the inconvenience
11/09/23, 2:15 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Is it not possible to use the report coz at the bottom it says  she passed grade 11 and can proceed to grade 12?
17/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Irene.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:05 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good evening ma'am.
We totally understand ☺️ wishing your a speedy recovery and thank you for informing us.
Have a blessed evening further 🙏
18/09/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 6:29 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am thank you
18/09/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 6:31 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am
18/09/23, 6:31 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am thank you
18/09/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/09/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/09/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/09/23, 6:39 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am I understand
18/09/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level / Grade 12 results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/09/23, 6:43 pm - +27 79 719 6837: May you please provide me with more information ma'am
18/09/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels / 45% passing marks in grade 12.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/09/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/09/23, 6:46 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I agree
18/09/23, 6:46 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am thank you I fully understand now
18/09/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades)/ 45% passing marks in grade 12 exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 6:54 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
18/09/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ Grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I agree
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level/ grade 12 exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/09/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/09/23, 6:58 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am noted
18/09/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27797196837 kindly excuse me for some time, as I am having my dinner break now, I will be connecting with you within an hour time, please.
18/09/23, 7:02 pm - +27 79 719 6837: That's okay ma'am I understand ☺️
19/09/23, 7:18 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good evening ma'am
19/09/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Irene,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
19/09/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:21 pm - +27 79 719 6837: It's okay ma'am I understand ☺️
19/09/23, 7:21 pm - +27 79 719 6837: This is truly amazing
19/09/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I am very excited for you to be in these pictures, next year.
19/09/23, 7:24 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Likewise ma'am . I'm very excited as well.
19/09/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now, may I know if you are available to connect with us to continue with our discussion?
19/09/23, 7:28 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now may I know if you are clear here?
19/09/23, 7:30 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
19/09/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now moving forward.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level/ Grade 12 results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
19/09/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/09/23, 7:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
19/09/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
19/09/23, 7:46 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am
19/09/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
19/09/23, 8:48 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am they are all clear
19/09/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
19/09/23, 8:53 pm - +27 79 719 6837: I'm sure my Mom understands ma'am
19/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
19/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
19/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
19/09/23, 8:56 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
19/09/23, 9:01 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
19/09/23, 9:02 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I'm sure my Mom is following along with us
19/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 20th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 05th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
19/09/23, 9:04 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
19/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
19/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 20th of September, the deadline becomes the 05th of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 20th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 05th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 05th of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
19/09/23, 9:06 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am it's all clear thus far
19/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
19/09/23, 9:09 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am they are thank you
19/09/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
19/09/23, 9:26 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Okay ma'am
19/09/23, 9:33 pm - +27 79 719 6837: My admission process will start once my Mom gives the program a go ahead. There are two ways the process to go according to whichever one my Mom chooses.
The first being the proceed per the standard without any benefits where we will be paying the full registration fee within 15 days of getting the offer letter which is around $750.
Then the second approach would be the early Decision benefits and this then helps the student pay the registration fee in parts. This will also provide the student with a grant of $150 so the registration fee would then be $600 which can be paid in parts of $300 so 15 days after the offer letter and then the remainder within that month of the offer letter received.
19/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
19/09/23, 9:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I am clear on this
19/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
19/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *05th October* and *05th November*.
19/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would want your parents to be online and if they are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *05th of October and 05th of November*), can you give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
19/09/23, 9:52 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Good evening.my apology for delayed response. I would love to get early registration with benefits however am not in good position to pay 300USD by 5 October.will it be possible to pay by end of October?The reason is am paying school fees for Irene for this year still so am unable to meet this suggested date.
20/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Irene.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, thank you for sharing that with me, I understand your concern here, so let me help you, the deadlines would completely depend on when the university is able to generate Irene's offer letter, usually, the letter is generated within a week time, so, for example, Irene's offer letter was generated on the 27th of September 2023, you will be required to pay the $300 on 12th October and the remaining $300 on the 12th November.
20/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you may not be ready, however, I would like to make you understand that the Early decision benefits are only for the students who wish to finalize their college admission in the month of September if you wish to continue in the month of October, then Irene's process would be carried forward with the Standard admission process, where you would be required to pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days of receiving the offer letter and without the $150 grant form Edoofa.
20/09/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So please I would like you to take some time to think properly have a discussion as a family and then come up with a decision by tomorrow, I would never want you to miss this opportunity for Irene, as it not only offers flexible payment plans, plus the $150 grant along with the 7 benefits.
20/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good evening ma'am.
We will most definitely discuss the way forward 🙏🏽
20/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @27797196837
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Good evening. Will try to apply for a loan.
21/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Irene.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you were able to have a discussion as a family?
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Good afternoon. I will see what I can do to pay the 300.
21/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that in that case, if you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned *tentative deadlines ( *05th of October and 05th of November*), can you give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare Irene's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - +27 74 817 0705: You may proceed
21/09/23, 3:28 pm - +27 74 817 0705: My friend's son started Computer Science  in this month at SBRR MAHAJANA FIRST GRADE COLLEGE
 Under University of Mysore
21/09/23, 3:28 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Wil thus be on your list as well
21/09/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that let me help you understand. Now, I understand that since you are not physically present here and since you have limited knowledge about the universities here in India, you do believe in the information that you get. But, since we have been in the Indian Education sector for more than a decade now, we do have strong connections with the education ministry and organizations all over India due to which we know all about the universities here in India.

Now, let us first discuss SBRR MAHAJANA FIRST GRADE COLLEGE. Since you yourself have mentioned its name, I believe you were not aware of the fact that SBRR MAHAJANA FIRST GRADE COLLEGE is not among the institutions listed in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, and due to the same reason any degree completed by the students at SBRR MAHAJANA FIRST GRADE COLLEGE is not recognized.
21/09/23, 4:07 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Ooh I see. Please ignore my request. My apologies. I do trust you
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are connected with the Ministries, and Education Board where we have the rankings and information of the universities, and based on that we recommend. 

Whereas sometimes who is sitting 1000 miles away, the only source of information would be the internet and we do not want a situation where you later complain about the quality. Hence please do not worry about the Universities as they will be of quality of education and well as well recognized as per the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking.
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Irene's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *05th of October and 05th of November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Yes. Am.
21/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Irene's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Irene's higher education well.
21/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted thank you ma'am
21/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/09/23, 9:39 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am thank you
21/09/23, 9:40 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Enjoy the rest of your evening 🙏🏽
21/09/23, 9:40 pm - +27 74 817 0705: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:41 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Thank you. Have a good evening
21/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you have a great night to you too.
26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Irene!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
26/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Oh my gosh thank you so much ma'am 😁
26/09/23, 2:10 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Am so excited for you Irene. Thank you Mr Milan.we will go through the letter. Until tomorrow...have a good evening
26/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will now connect with each other tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss about the letter. Until then, have a good day!
27/09/23, 12:31 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good afternoon ma'am 😊
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Irene!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: We are well thank you and yourself
27/09/23, 12:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes we went over the document yesterday
27/09/23, 12:50 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Hello. Hope you are well.
May I please know if Irene will have one offer only or you are still sending through other offers?
27/09/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, stay assured that we will discuss about all the queries that you have here moving ahead during our conversation. For now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:03 pm - +27 79 719 6837: 1. 900USD
2. The course is for 3 years
3. 300USD
4. $750
27/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:20 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Ma'am how long is a semester?
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Isnt registration fee 600USD
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - +27 74 817 0705: 6 months I think
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Every semester is of 6 months please as I have already stated above.
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee, we are coming to that moving ahead during our discussion. Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:26 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am thank you
27/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:29 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
27/09/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:32 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
27/09/23, 1:35 pm - +27 74 817 0705: All clear. Thank you
27/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:41 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am so the $750 is paid on top of the $300 ?
27/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27797196837 May I know if you have gone through this message of mine properly dear?
27/09/23, 1:46 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Ohh I understand now ma'am okay
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in South Africa, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
27/09/23, 1:56 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, I'm glad you understand. Additionally, I want to let you know that there's an alternate payment mode for you if you're in South Africa. You can use a service called "Mama Money" to make your payment. May I know if you are aware of that?
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes I'm sure my mom is aware of it ma'am
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you would wish to make the payment using Mama Money, please let us know of that a day before so that I can help you in making the payment accordingly. Is that clear?
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
27/09/23, 3:35 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Ma'am will this be the only university offer I receive
27/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here?
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am thank you
27/09/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
27/09/23, 4:34 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
27/09/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: No ma'am I was not aware of that
27/09/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
27/09/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
27/09/23, 4:40 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am I understand
27/09/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, may I know if you are clear about the same please?
27/09/23, 4:41 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am all is clear
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, we will connect with each other tomorrow to proceed with our discussions. Have a good day ahead.
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Thank you ma'am enjoy your day further
28/09/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
28/09/23, 10:20 am - +27 79 719 6837: Good morning ma'am
28/09/23, 10:20 am - +27 79 719 6837: We are well thank you and yourself
28/09/23, 10:21 am - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am we have decided to take the offer
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - +27 79 719 6837: We looked at the university some more and they liked it. My mom and I also discussed accommodation and we came to the conclusion that it would be best if I stay on campus. But otherwise we are clear on everything.
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have been working hard to ensure that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
28/09/23, 2:25 pm - +27 79 719 6837: No ma'am
28/09/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
28/09/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Thank you ma'am
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - +27 79 719 6837: We will be paying in two parts ma'am
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today. It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - +27 79 719 6837: I'm not so sure ma'am. My mom just entered a work meeting so when she's done she will inform you if that's alright?
28/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, once you have a conversation with your mom on that, please let me know.
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Ma'am she said that she will pay from January and then hostel fees she will try by the end of November
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Irene, I was asking about the payment of your registration fee dear.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Ohhh sorry ma'am
28/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, please discuss about the payment of the registration fee with your mother and then let me know.
28/09/23, 2:47 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Irene, as per the discussion that we had here regarding the completion of your admission process, may I know if you were able to discuss the same with your mother about by when is she planning to pay the registration fee?
29/09/23, 10:18 am - +27 79 719 6837: Good morning ma'am
29/09/23, 10:19 am - +27 79 719 6837: She's planning to pay before the registration deadline ma'am.
29/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. However, do you have any date for me when your mother would be doing the same so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
29/09/23, 10:22 am - +27 79 719 6837: No ma'am I don't have a fixed date yet
29/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Did you not discuss it with your mother dear?
29/09/23, 10:25 am - +27 79 719 6837: I did ma'am, she's still waiting for her loan to come through then she'll be able to give a fixed date if that's okay
29/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that, note, I would encourage you to finalize a date on when you would be making the payment of the fee so that we can update the university officials as well.

With this, we are done with our sessions for now and since you have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
29/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: That being said, we will end our conversation for today. Have a wonderful day and please convey our greetings to your family as well!
29/09/23, 10:37 am - +27 79 719 6837: Noted ma'am thank you
03/10/23, 9:39 am - +27 74 817 0705: Good morning. I trust you are well. May I please raise a concern from my side.

Am really grateful for this opportunity and I would like Irene to join however the cost of everything per year it's a bit more than I can afford. Is there a way I can have the hostel fee reduced a bit. 

If everything could maybe total of 2500( fees .acc food per year it's and 2.500).

Referring to the offer it's even costing more than studying here and the reason why we reached out was to hope for a bit less. Am a single mother and I won't be able to meet annual cost. 

Could you kindly help me to get the everything on 2500🙏
03/10/23, 9:48 am - +27 74 817 0705: Is this because of the course she choose that makes it this march?
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern here with me dear. Now, on that note, I would first like to clarify that from what you have mentioned here, I believe you want to say that you wish for the total per annum costs for Irene's higher education here in India to be around $2500 please. Am I getting you right here?
03/10/23, 1:27 pm - +27 74 817 0705: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
03/10/23, 1:27 pm - +27 74 817 0705: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
03/10/23, 1:28 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Hello. Yes that's is correct. This is what we wre advised by Shabham early this year.
03/10/23, 1:29 pm - +27 74 817 0705: So I agreed because this I could try to raise
03/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, may I know if you were able to go through this message of mine earlier?
03/10/23, 1:30 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Yes. If possible.please
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27748170705 May you please also let me know of this as well?
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - +27 74 817 0705: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - +27 74 817 0705: You mean this one?
03/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am asking about this message here, do you recall that we had discussed this please?
03/10/23, 2:52 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Yes. I saw it now
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - +27 74 817 0705: That option is affordable however I don't feel comfortable for her to live outside the campus especially in her first year. That is why I was preferring hostel option
03/10/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, on that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
03/10/23, 3:24 pm - +27 74 817 0705: I understand.
03/10/23, 3:25 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Do you perhaps have pictures of the houses
03/10/23, 3:28 pm - +27 74 817 0705: I will discuss with Irene. But if she want to eat at the canteen is she allowed to buy food from there.
03/10/23, 3:28 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Am worried that she won't be able to cook on her own
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the canteen will be accessible, however, the hostel mess won't be. When it comes to cooking by themselves, you can stay assured that most of the students choose this method since this is more affordable please. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - +27 74 817 0705: It is clear thank you. I Wil discuss with Irene. Do you perhaps have pictures of some of these houses
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the pictures, I would have to arrange the same, as soon as I will receive the same, I will let you know. I hope that is okay with you?
03/10/23, 3:40 pm - +27 74 817 0705: That is okay. Am sorry to bother you. One tends to get worried when sending a child in a country you have never been.
03/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, being a parent myself, I can understand that. Moving ahead, may I know if you have any other queries to ask as well?
03/10/23, 3:41 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Regarding medical aid....what will be the cost?
05/10/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here. Now, let me help you with your query here.
05/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the Medical Insurance, the annual cost for the same would be around $80 please. I believe this is clear, right?
05/10/23, 11:32 am - +27 74 817 0705: Well noted with thanks
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, may I know if you have any other queries to ask please?
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Irene!

06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +27 79 719 6837: Good afternoon ma'am apologies I was at summer school
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - +27 79 719 6837: But we are clear thus far thank you 🙏 we don't have any queries at the moment
06/10/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, may I know if you were able to discuss about the date that you are going to make the payment of your registration fee please?
06/10/23, 5:54 pm - +27 74 817 0705: I have applied for a loan at work so am waiting for chief financial officer to approve. He was on business trip so hopefully he will be in on Monday
07/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I believe you are aware of the fact that the university has given you the date of 10th October to make the payment of your registration fee, therefore, do you believe that you would be able to get the loan amount before then and pay the registation fee?
07/10/23, 11:40 am - +27 74 817 0705: Hello. Am hoping to meet the deadline but if I fail will it be possible to get an extension?
09/10/23, 10:41 am - +27 74 817 0705: Good morning. May you please help me to move the payment to 26 October?  Our chief financial officer is not in today to authoriser the loan. I promise you I will pay end of Oct and finish the balance in Nov. I have tried other means but I couldn't get this amount.🙏
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. On that note, I understand that due to some challenges, you were not able to make the payment on time as per the deadlines shared by the university please. However, since you have mentioned that you are planning to make the payment by 26th October, if I may ask are you certain about the same that you would be able to do that please?
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +27 74 817 0705: Hello Milan, yes I get paid 25 Oct. So I will definitely be able to make the payment
11/10/23, 11:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well.

I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
24/11/23, 12:39 am - +27 74 817 0705: I do understand
24/11/23, 12:40 am - +27 74 817 0705: May I please ask if classes will be taught in English and not in Hindu?
25/11/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irene!
I hope you are doing well today.

25/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good to hear from you! Absolutely, the classes will be taught in English, not Hindi. It is due to the fact that Galgotias Univeristy understands the importance of language proficiency and aim to ensure a comfortable learning environment for all students. I hope this is clear?
25/11/23, 10:41 am - +27 79 719 6837: Yes ma'am thank you

28/11/23, 8:56 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we had here on Saturday, you had mentioned that you are planning to make the payment of Irene's registration fee through Mama Money. On that note, can you please help me in understanding more about the date you intend to make the payment so that I can share the same update with the university officials as well as proceed towards preparing for the next steps according to that?
