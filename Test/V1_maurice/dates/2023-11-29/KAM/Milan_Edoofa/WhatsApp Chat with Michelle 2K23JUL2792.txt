As the admission process discussion is likely to finish within 4 days, so please be attentive so we can carry the process smoothly without any delay. I hope we are clear on this?
21/08/23, 8:04 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Yes I am Kwakwarhi Mwanamai, I am CEO for Corridor, our family business. We do consulting in social development and also run a lodge by the same name Corridor.

21/08/23, 8:06 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: We take note of this and will endeavor to be responsive. @265999893586 is responding to an emergency but will be back home soon. 

We are glad and ready to make the most of the 4 day lead time.
21/08/23, 8:06 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
21/08/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the brief introduction @265888871827, it is really lovely to know more about you as a family. Indeed Michelle will make you more proud in the future and make your business grow more.
21/08/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Kunal, and he did brief me about Michelle's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
21/08/23, 8:13 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Well, I really enjoyed the counselling session. Getting to know more about Edoofa and myself as a person and student during the discussions, opening my mind towards many possibilities. The more I engaged in those discussions the more I felt enlightened and inspired, and I love the fact that there won't be so much pressure on my parents with the fees because I'll be able to make up for it by the Earn While You Learn program. I also love that as an Edoofian I'll be able to go to any school I'd like based on what schools offer me a spot.
21/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience! I have known Mr. Kunal for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
21/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
21/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Michelle 2K23JUL2792)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
21/08/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Michelle EWYL23E0567)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

22/08/23, 12:09 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?

22/08/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/08/23, 12:16 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Let's begin
22/08/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 12:57 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I am done
22/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
22/08/23, 1:06 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very clear Ma'am
22/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 1:08 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes I'm following.
22/08/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/08/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/08/23, 1:09 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I am on track.
22/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/08/23, 1:13 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes ma'am
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/08/23, 1:19 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: If the next session could be scheduled for 3pm I'd be glad
22/08/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 03.00 pm?
22/08/23, 1:21 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes, I will.
22/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
22/08/23, 3:36 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
22/08/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
22/08/23, 3:48 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Firstly, important messages to newly enrolled Edoofians are to follow instructions keenly, and to be open-minded.
Secondly, Edoofa not only provides affordable high-quality education and makes students employable through the Student of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success (SEELS), but it also provides personal development by improving responsibility and independence.
In addition, the third point ensures students that Edoofa has invested over 10 years to identify suitable and qualified colleges, universities and schools for all passionate Edoofians.
Last but not least, the fourth video let's us understand that the Statement of Purpose is an important document that students must handle and tackle with diligence and promptness.
22/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
22/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
22/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
22/08/23, 3:57 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
22/08/23, 3:58 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
22/08/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
22/08/23, 6:25 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: That's great
22/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
22/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
22/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
22/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/08/23, 7:24 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay I will
22/08/23, 7:24 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thank you
22/08/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. MSCE Results/Letter of Recommendation.*

*2. JCE Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
22/08/23, 7:25 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: I am following the discussion with keen. Glad we are making great progress. Thank you!
22/08/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, You are welcome.
22/08/23, 7:26 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: For my year we only had MSCE, we didn't write JCE so I can only provide 1 and 3
22/08/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know the same. In that case, may I suggest you please request a letter from the school about the same, stating that by your time JCE was removed and you have passed the equivalent examination that was held in place of JCE. 

I hope we are clear?
22/08/23, 7:32 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: It won't happen overnight though, they are on holiday. The best I can do is a week.
22/08/23, 7:32 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: For that letter, the rest is readily available and can be sent as we speak.
22/08/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, you can share the MSCE results, your grade 9 results, and your identity proof for the letter can I anticipate that you will be able to collect it from the school by this Friday at 12.30 pm which is the 25th of August 2023?
22/08/23, 7:39 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Grade 9 results?
22/08/23, 7:40 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Is there a way we can do this with only the MSCE and ID? Because I can't guarantee I'd get the other documents due to some complications because of changing schools.
22/08/23, 7:41 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: And grade 9 was 2017, I don't think the school would as much as agree to looking for the records.
22/08/23, 7:43 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Grade 9 shld be JCE?
22/08/23, 7:43 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Or form 1?
22/08/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, one of the documents is mandatory. If grade 9( lower secondary) is difficult for you to collect from the school then you would have to ask for the letter stating that by your time JCE was removed and you have passed the equivalent examination that was held in place of JCE.
22/08/23, 7:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay I'll do my best ma'am. Friday it is.
22/08/23, 7:45 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: For the letter
22/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the rest of the tasks by tomorrow 01.00 pm and collect the letter by Friday?
22/08/23, 7:46 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Precisely 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
22/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm. Have a great night.
22/08/23, 7:47 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Likewise

23/08/23, 4:35 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Question 1
23/08/23, 4:48 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Business management process life cycle refers to the stages a business process goes through from it's inception to it's completion. The stages are as follows.

23/08/23, 4:48 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Question 2
23/08/23, 4:59 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Businesses play a vital role in the economy through various ways.

1. Businesses create jobs. When a manufacturing company sets up, they employ multiple people to tale part in the development of their new product. This reduces number of unemployed people in the country.

2. Technological advancements and innovation. A tech startup develops a groundbreaking software solution that revolutionizes a specific industry, leading to increased productivity and efficiency in that sector for all businesses. This fosters economic growth for all businesses. 

3.Tax contributions. If a multinational corporation establishes it's headquarters in a country, it can result in significant tax revenues that can develop different parts of the country's economic status.

4. Investment and capital formation. An established financial institution provides funding to entrepreneurs and small businesses so that they can grow and contribute to the economy through job creation and innovation.
23/08/23, 4:59 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Question 3
23/08/23, 5:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: As a first born child and only girl, I've been raised and trained to be a leader amongst my siblings and family in general. I am taught to guide by strength, confidence, equality and gentleness to ensure equal treatment and justice, not only amongst my family but with my friends, school peers and any work opportunity.

I have been working with my Dad in his hospitality and consultancy business and I am occasionally assigned tasks that involve charismatic and prudent actions towards and around his employees. With a gentle yet just mind and heart, I work steadily to achieve organisational growth and success, and improve my personal charismatic skills.

Born with natural communication skills, I am able to settle disputes, delegate tasks and communicate plans with all parties involved in the day's work. Everybody has got a job to do, and that is what I make sure is achieved at the end of each day.

23/08/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Michelle.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. That is alright, may I know by when will you be able to share your academic documents?
23/08/23, 8:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 8:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 8:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: There we go
23/08/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, identity proof, and MSCE results, while we wait for the JCE Letter, I hope you will be able to share the same by Friday the rest is duly noted with us and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on it so that your university application is well prepared.
23/08/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
23/08/23, 8:09 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes ma'am
23/08/23, 8:10 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Great😊
23/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
23/08/23, 8:28 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I'm ready
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/08/23, 8:31 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I agree
23/08/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
23/08/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
23/08/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
23/08/23, 8:37 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes we discussed
23/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1250-$1500 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
23/08/23, 8:51 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
23/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
23/08/23, 8:52 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very clear Ma'am
23/08/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
23/08/23, 8:53 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I am following, right on track.
23/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
23/08/23, 9:10 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: No we're good for now
23/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
23/08/23, 9:14 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Ouh I'm glad😊
23/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night @265882055900, and do convey my regards to your parents as well.
23/08/23, 9:16 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Likewise Ms Kirti, I will🫱🏼‍🫲🏽

23/08/23, 9:52 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Sorry  before you completely close on this, To have a clear picture how much will we have to pay for the first academic year? The figures you used as an example now got me confused sorry.
23/08/23, 9:53 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Depending on the offer letters from different universities and the University we'll pick, they will have clear annual fee  then we'll deduct what we paid already.
23/08/23, 9:58 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Ok
24/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle.

13/09/23, 4:17 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I remember
13/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know if we are on the same page?
13/09/23, 4:25 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Step 1 is a message from the founder's office whereby there are clear videos designed for students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian. Second step is the statement of purpose which is the only subjective document that will allow students to convinced the admission board and school(s) that the student is worthy of scholarship. The third step is the counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship which takes about 1 hour.
The fourth step is receiving offer letters from universities based on Edoofa's recommendations, student's academic documents and the Statement of Purpose. The fifth step is registration and admission acceptance letter where the student pays the registration fee to save a seat and to smoothen the VISA process. Last but not least, the sixth step is the VISA process which is the last step to get the student to India.
13/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Uhm not right now ma'am, no questions.
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Unless @265888871827 @265999893586 you have a question?
13/09/23, 4:42 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: All is clear
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes, we're definitely ready😊
13/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
13/09/23, 4:45 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Time is taken note of, and we'll surely be here.
16/09/23, 9:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Michelle.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was a little under the weather, however, I do feel better now. If you are available to connect with us today, we can start with our discussion?
16/09/23, 9:47 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Good morning Ms. Kirti. I'm really sorry, I'm glad you're better. We can connect now, thanks.
16/09/23, 9:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the concern, really means a lot. Great, Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
16/09/23, 9:52 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Sorry to hear that. Good morning Ms Kirti.
16/09/23, 9:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @265999893586 how are you doing today?
16/09/23, 9:55 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Am great thanks. How are you 2?
16/09/23, 9:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing great, thank you for asking, I am doing well now, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
16/09/23, 10:03 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes i have Ms Kirti
16/09/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so I would like to know have you been made aware of this opportunity?
16/09/23, 10:12 am - +265 882 05 59 00: No, enlighten me please.
16/09/23, 10:17 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Is it through the EWYL Program? <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: No, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
16/09/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
16/09/23, 10:19 am - +265 999 89 35 86: How Many registration fees is one supposed to pay?
16/09/23, 10:20 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Which one is that, which we were told is 100℅ covered by Edoofa? Am confused
16/09/23, 10:21 am - +265 999 89 35 86: You may enlighten us on that
16/09/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter hence making your registration fee zero. 

I hope you are clear now?
16/09/23, 10:26 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Aaah ok. I understand
16/09/23, 10:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
16/09/23, 10:33 am - +265 882 05 59 00: True, true.
16/09/23, 10:33 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes
16/09/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
16/09/23, 10:40 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes I'm aware
16/09/23, 10:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level/ MSCE results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period. <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
16/09/23, 10:49 am - +265 882 05 59 00: I've gone through them.
16/09/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
16/09/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/ MCSE results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
16/09/23, 11:01 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes please
16/09/23, 11:01 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes very clear
16/09/23, 11:01 am - +265 999 89 35 86: I wasn't
16/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.

2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
16/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
16/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
16/09/23, 11:12 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Well noted
16/09/23, 11:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
16/09/23, 11:20 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Understood fully
16/09/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
16/09/23, 11:23 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Same page
16/09/23, 11:24 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
16/09/23, 11:24 am - +265 882 05 59 00: No queries, you can proceed
16/09/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
16/09/23, 11:35 am - +265 882 05 59 00: As for me we're clear, but the parents I'm not sure cause they may be busy with work so it's a bit hard to keep up. If anything, I'm sure they'll ask you
16/09/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page, I am sure, they will catch up with the conversation when they are available.  I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
16/09/23, 11:46 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes I know, let me try and poke them to catch up so we can proceed
16/09/23, 11:49 am - +265 888 87 18 27: Hello @917292063289 ! Greetings from Lilongwe. Am preparing for a workshop next week but have been following the conversation. 

Let the process go ahead as we are both mentally and financially prepared for this 😊
16/09/23, 11:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, @265888871827 in the meantime I will have a discussion with @265882055900 and you can go through the conversation and then respond accordingly if you have any queries,
16/09/23, 11:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: so shall we begin with our discussion @265882055900?
16/09/23, 11:52 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes please
16/09/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
16/09/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
16/09/23, 11:59 am - +265 882 05 59 00: We're on the same page, I recall very well yes.
16/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
16/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
16/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
16/09/23, 12:15 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Oh okay
16/09/23, 12:15 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I'm very clear
16/09/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
16/09/23, 12:17 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Please help me understand
16/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 01st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
16/09/23, 12:18 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes, proceed
16/09/23, 12:19 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Following
16/09/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
16/09/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
16/09/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, the deadline becomes the 01st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 01st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 01st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
16/09/23, 12:20 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Totally on the same page yes
16/09/23, 12:22 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Before u proceed Ms Kirti
16/09/23, 12:22 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: I have a question <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please @265999893586 ?
16/09/23, 12:23 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: The fees being mentioned here are just an example or thats what it will be? The tuition fees? Since in the early discussions we were told the fees will range to about 1500? Or 2000 annually <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265999893586 I understand your concern as a parent, however, please do not worry, that was just an example, for you to understand better the offer letter for Michelle, will be within the same fee range that was informed you in your counseling session and as per your acceptance letter, Please do not worry.
16/09/23, 12:30 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Thanks Ms Kirti. In these hard times money issues can really worry us. Lol
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand that completely, I hope you are clear now, so shall we move ahead?
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Let's
16/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
16/09/23, 12:36 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I have revised them and it's safe to say that I understand them very well.
16/09/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
16/09/23, 12:41 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Sure
16/09/23, 1:01 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: The admission process begins after academic review questions and the statement of purpose is submitted. There is the standard procedure and the early decision benefits. Standard procedure involves receiving an offer letter from a university, then having a gap of 15 days to pay the complete registration fee of $750. Early registration involves being eligible for the 6 benefits, the early decision grant of $150 which is paid by Edoofa and subtracted from the initial registration fee $750, which leaves 600 to be paid in 2 halves. The deadline for the standard procedure is the next 15 days after letter of intent from university, while the deadline for the Early registration is first $300 to be paid in first 15 days after letter of intent and the second $300 will be paid a month after the first half.
16/09/23, 1:02 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Really sorry for the late response, I'm juggling between this meeting and work.
16/09/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand,  Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
16/09/23, 1:18 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Very much clear
16/09/23, 1:18 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very very clear
16/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
16/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *01st October* and *01st November*.
16/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *01st of October and 01st of November*), can you give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Michelle's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
16/09/23, 1:22 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay
16/09/23, 1:23 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
16/09/23, 1:26 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Lets us have a discussion first
16/09/23, 1:26 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Then we will be able to respond accordingly
16/09/23, 1:27 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: By the way? If we decide that u start the process of applying for places on 1 October. Where does that fall in? 1st or 2nd option?
16/09/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you understand if we start sharing applications to the university from October 01st then it would be considered as the Standard admission Process, where the $150 grant will not be applicable, since the early decision benefits and the grant if for the students who want to reserve the seat and finazile the admission in the month of September. Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

I hope you are clear now?
16/09/23, 1:40 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Clear
16/09/23, 1:41 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I, too, have a question. This $750 we're speaking of, which is of course exemplary, is it the $350 we paid in August?
16/09/23, 1:41 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: She already explained of this above. Let me tag u.
16/09/23, 1:42 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay
16/09/23, 1:43 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Here @265882055900
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Only that it would be too sudden for us to process this. Its always hard to process online payments in Malawi suddenly. Hence my question
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Ooooh alright I have connected
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: But we will discuss and give you final feedback
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Exactly
16/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
16/09/23, 2:05 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Thanks alot. And you too Ma'am
16/09/23, 2:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thanks and likewise.
18/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Michelle.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that @265999893586. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Michelle's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *01st of October and 01st of November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
18/09/23, 2:28 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes we are. Thanks
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Michelle's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Michelle's higher education well.
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright thank you
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Noted. Thanks
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: One question though, when the letters of intent come through, will thy be sent to your organisation or to my email??
18/09/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the letter will be shared with you through your Email, however, if we received the letter before, we shall share it with you here on WhatsApp.
18/09/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @265999893586 @265882055900 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay thank you
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright understood
18/09/23, 6:20 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Good evening @917292063289 . Am on duty travel but following. Thanks
19/09/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Michelle,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
19/09/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:50 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Where are these students from? Different countries ?
20/09/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 8:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:04 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Woow🤩🤩🤩
20/09/23, 8:07 am - +265 888 87 18 27: Good morning @919540716843. Good to hear from you this morning!
20/09/23, 8:10 am - +265 888 87 18 27: This is indeed glad tidings 😊 It's been an amazing journey and as parents we can't hide out excitement 🙂 we are so delighted!
20/09/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so happy about the offer letter please. Moving ahead, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 12:57 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: We've gone through it, yes.
20/09/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:00 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: #1. $900
#2. 3 years
#3. $300
#4. $750
20/09/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:01 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Have gone through it yes
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes...
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 1:03 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
20/09/23, 1:05 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Following
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:07 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Together
20/09/23, 1:07 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Yes. Understood
20/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:08 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: We are clear
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:19 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Understood
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very clear
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, coming to the payment mode. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Am kind of confused
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Will request a summary of total payments to be made for one whole academic year from you @919540716843
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: So that am able to understand the exact costs
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: @265999893586 Sure, moving ahead in our conversation I would surely do that as well for your convenience, before that, may I know if you all are clear till here?
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Sure, Clear
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Following
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Following
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes clear
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 1:56 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: With OFF campus accommodation it means a student will have to buy and make food for themselves yea? Another expense
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Just to understand though, why will a student on a 100℅ scholarship have to pay for accommodation? Yet the offer letter stated that the fee that she will be allocated will include everything like food, accommodation, laundry etc?
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is not true please. When we consider about the off-campus costs of $800 that are explained in our above discussion, the food costs as well as the accommodation costs are already factored in please. Therefore, no other expense. I believe this is clear?
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Ok understood
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here. Can you please help me in understanding about the same again and give me clarity on what is it exactly that you wish to know?
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: I was Reffering here where it is written "self catering"
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay she means when I was granted the scholarship I was told that it's a 100% scholarship and that my remaining expenses will range from $750-$1000
20/09/23, 2:01 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Why is there a cost for accommodation when a 100% scholarship included everything like accommodation laundry, food etc
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: And on that, we were told I'd only pay the remaining fee, registration fee, and handle my travel expenses but the scholarship will handle all accomodations and everything else in India. So the confusion comes now that you're saying we will also pay for accomodation.
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: According to the screenshot that has been sent by @265999893586, if we subtract the 50% off offer that is given by the school we will remain with $1900 total, which isn't even close to the range given in the acceptance document.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: $1250-$1500 but this one is reaching $2800.... Doesn't make sense.
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up these important questions and concerns regarding the scholarship and the associated expenses. Now, kindly allow me to explain the same to you here and help you in understanding the same. 

Firstly, I want to clarify that the offer letter you received is indeed a scholarship offer, but it is not the 100% scholarship we initially discussed. The 100% scholarship was a personalized recommendation shared by your counselor based on your profile, which we shared with our partner universities. The offer you've received is from a different partner university that is offering a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I want to reassure you that your counselor did indeed recommend you for a 100% scholarship. We have taken your application and shared it with our partner universities that offer such scholarships. 

Now, I understand that this discrepancy can be confusing, and I apologize for any misunderstanding. It seems there might have been some crossed wires in the communication process. We are still awaiting responses from the universities that offer 100% scholarships, and we will keep you updated as soon as we hear back from them. I hope you are clear about that now?
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Ok, that makes sense at the same time, We were given a list of associated universities with Edoofa Scholarships and Galgitias was on the list. Will check and screen shot 2.

Please take conderation that the conditions that we were told are the ones that inspired or encouraged us to take up this Edoofa scholarship. If the results will be coming totally different, it will kind of frustrate us . 
But i understand these things do happen. Thanks @919540716843
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, and I truly appreciate your patience in this matter. I understand how important it is for you to have clarity and confidence in the scholarship process.

Now, on that note, I would also like to help you in recalling that, it must have been discussed during the counseling session that we will share your application with multiple universities and for those who will accept your application, you will get multiple offer letters, right?
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very well then, this is understood and I'm glad it's cleared out.
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. May I Know if you have gone through this message of mine as well?
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, do you have any idea that when a student gets multiple offer letters, how is his admission navigated and confirmed among those?
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Uhm no, enlighten us please.
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here?
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Understood
20/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes yes. Very clear and waiting patiently
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Clear
20/09/23, 3:15 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
20/09/23, 3:15 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: No. Tell us more about the transfer option
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/09/23, 3:17 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: How long do we have for a response to Galgotias?
20/09/23, 3:17 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Oh okay
20/09/23, 3:18 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Very well understood
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, the letter from Galgotias is only valid till the first deadline date, i.e. 04th October. Now, in such cases we as the admissions team always recommend the parents to secure the opportunity that they receive at the very first time to secure their scholarship seat and after that they can always use the transfer option to switch universities without any hassle. I believe this is clear to you?
20/09/23, 3:27 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright, it's clear. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, may I know if you are clear about the queries that you had regarding the offer letter please?
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Everything's clear, for now.
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: You can proceed with the university insights.
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 3:38 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Wow I'm intrigued, very beautiful campus with amazing facilities🔥🔥🔥
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright, duly noted.
20/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Have a good day ahead!
22/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
22/09/23, 1:40 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Afternoon to you two . Am good and how are u?
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: The conditions of Edoofa scholarship that were offered to Out Daughter are not similar to those that came from Galgotias. So we are kind of reluctant to go ahead with that since we were not offered 50℅ scholarship program. But rather 100℅ associated with other costs of course. 

Its confusing on out part, coz thats not what we expected to be getting. 

The main reason why we opted to go ahead with this was the minimal costs that were indicated in the offer letter.
24/09/23, 7:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:18 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: All good here. Hope you are too
24/09/23, 7:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine too thank you for asking. Now, I was able to go through the message that you have shared here, and I completely understand that you might as well be a bit doubtful about securing the scholarship seat for Michelle, however, on that note, I have already made you understand about the same here.

Now, moving ahead, you can stay assured that you should focus on securing the scholarship seat for now, rest we are already in process to get the 90-100% scholarship offer for Michelle as we have already shared her application with the university. Now, once the offer letter arrives from there, we will then move proceed to utilize the transfer option available to us and shift Michelle to a more affordable university. I hope this is clear?
24/09/23, 7:20 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Evening to tou too @919540716843 . 

We are all well here. Hope you are too?
24/09/23, 7:21 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: As clear as this is, it still doesn't settle the fact that @918920091824 and @919540716843 and @919205095612 told us the only fee we bear is $350 that carries us through all applications. This $750 doesn't make sense to me because it has never been mentioned and it is only popping up after I started my EWYL program. Make me understand where it's coming from and why it was never mentioned.
24/09/23, 7:22 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: We were told we'd only pay 350$ to Edoofa as enrollment, which will cover applications and Visa assistance. The rest is balance from scholarship fee and our travel expenses. I still don't know where this new $750 is coming from and why it was never mentioned by anyone or in any of the documents.
24/09/23, 7:30 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Its clear. Let me just ask if what you mean is for us to go ahead and pay for Galgotias then we do transfer letter if we choose another school?
24/09/23, 7:30 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: From the last paragraph.
24/09/23, 7:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please let me first help you get clarity on the issue here. When it comes to the $350 enrollment fee, yes that is true that it caters for all the services and facilities you get being an Edoofian, however, this $750 we are talking about is the university registration fee, and I believe Mr. Kunal had discussed this with you during the counseling session as well. Let me share a snippet of the conversation that you had with him at the time.
24/09/23, 7:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/09/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Coming to this query of yours, yes, please you do have the absolute correct understanding of what I have mentioned here. Yes, please you should focus on securing the scholarship seat for now by completing the registration process, and then utilizing the transfer option to shift to a university that aligns better with your financial preparations. I hope this is clear?
24/09/23, 7:36 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay
24/09/23, 7:36 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: I think on this Michelle just forgot  that its there in the details. I very much remember it all. <This message was edited>
24/09/23, 7:36 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I get it now, we can move forward. I must have missed that part.
24/09/23, 7:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is completely fine Michelle, I understand that. Since the conversations that happened from the start have been quite long therefore, you may have missed that part and did not remember the same. Now, I believe you have proper clarity on the same, right?
24/09/23, 7:38 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes yes, apologies. I'm totally clear now, thanks for understanding.
24/09/23, 7:41 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Very much clear Yes. Does this mean we do not have a choice to wait for offers from other schools? Since we have been told clearly that we will receive multiple offers. Bearing in mind that the first school is not very much inline with what we were offered in terms on fees ranges? Why cant we wait for other offers and make a proper choice? I feel being pressurised to pay for this, we are focusing much on the payments than what we choose as an option.
24/09/23, 7:43 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: The picture we have had all along was we gonna get multiple offers and we compare, not just in terms on fees but also school history etc. Make a choice and proceed with the rest? Having one option is giving us some uncertainty. I hope you understand too?
24/09/23, 7:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: They said in case we don't get other offers we have to secure a seat with Galgotias before 4th October and that being our deadline for the early decision if I'm correct. Should we receive better offer letters later, we switch to whichever we like. So if we don't pay by 4th October it'll be a setback I think. I feel like as much as it seems we're putting the money first, it's necessary.
24/09/23, 7:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I don't know if I have answered your question, but that's as far as I understand.
24/09/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: From this communication, we are waiting for other offers and we would be happy to see what those offers have than rushing to pay for a scholarship that is not inline with what we were offered. This concerns money and am sure we all are careful how we decide to disburse money, satisfaction has to be there. Am sure you understand @919540716843  and team.
24/09/23, 8:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here. Now, let me please go through the same and answer on them one by one.
24/09/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns and the need for clarity in this situation. It's crucial to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to finances and education. You're correct that you were initially told you would receive multiple offers, and it's reasonable to want to explore your options fully before committing, however, if you look closely, the Transfer Option that has been provided to you here helps you in doing exactly the same. 

Now, the reason that we advise you to secure a seat with the first university is due to the fact that if one fails to secure the scholarship opportunity they are provided with, it leaves a bad impression on the academic board that the student is not serious about the scholarship and in turn it may also affect the offers that you may get from other universities. Now, as much as we want you to get a better scholarship offer, we do not want to academic board to think of you that way and that is why we suggest you to secure the scholarship. Otherwise, if you feel pressurized, you can let go of the offer letter, and then when the other offer letter will arrive you can work towards that. I hope you are clear now?
26/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the message that I had shared here earlier regarding your queries please?
26/09/23, 10:35 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Hope you're well, we're all good.
26/09/23, 10:42 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Morning to you 2 ma'am.
26/09/23, 10:48 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes we were. We prefer to wait for other offers since we are supposed to get multiple offers and go through them all then make a proper choice. With only one offer, we are not able to compare with anything making it a difficult decision.
The board of directors would be very unfair to consider that as lack of seriousness because even the board itself has not yet given us the multiple offers as stipulated in the agreement so that we can make a choice. 

At the moment we eagerly wait for the other offers then make a sound judgement based on that. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 9:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier as I was engaged in a discussion with the academic board about your concerns and on that note, we have also informed out other partner universities to process Michelle's application for a higher quantum of scholarship so that the total costs of her higher education can align with your budget. Now, we are expecting a response from their side within this week and as soon as we get one, we will let you know.
28/09/23, 9:53 am - +265 882 05 59 00: That's great

18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: With 1250 one time
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: And 2000 yearly?
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Am i right or lost?
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the same please, I had shared with you the costs as per the Galgotias Univeristy Leter. However, at MVN, the costs are $1250 per annum and the same will be adjusted as well. I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 4:46 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Ok i thought as much
18/10/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Annually is totaling to 2000 i guess?
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Clear
18/10/23, 4:48 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Very much clear here
18/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the payment mode, I believe since we had already discussed it eariler, it would remain the same. I hope you understand, right?
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! So, with this, we are done discussing the offer letter from MVN. Now, shall we move ahead to discuss the offer letter from GGI as well?
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
18/10/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from GGI by now?
18/10/23, 4:53 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes I was
18/10/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 1. 1200$
2. 1200$
3. 750$
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1200.
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200+ $1250) = $2450.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200 + $1000) = $2200.
18/10/23, 5:03 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Following
18/10/23, 5:03 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes
18/10/23, 5:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Before you proceed. Lets have a clear picture of how much wld be spent annually. I  have seen some small figures down the table
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Exactly
18/10/23, 5:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I have explained the same here about how much the costs will be depending on the type of accommodation that you will choose.
18/10/23, 5:18 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: But am not talking about accommodation but the list down there about exam fees etc
18/10/23, 5:19 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: If we overlook them now there may be a problem later because anything quoted in dollars here in Malawi is alot of money😂
18/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Exactly
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, on that note, if you may total the amount of the same, including the exam fee, ERP Fee, and Uniform Fee, it would be around $80 please. I hope this is clear, right?
19/10/23, 6:21 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright alright
19/10/23, 6:46 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes
19/10/23, 8:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 8:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, shall we continue with our discussion here regarding your offer letter from GGI please?
19/10/23, 8:40 am - +265 882 05 59 00: All good. I hope you are too.
19/10/23, 8:40 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes let's proceed
19/10/23, 8:55 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Sure
19/10/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
19/10/23, 9:10 am - +265 999 89 35 86: 4 sharing
19/10/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
19/10/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for four-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2200 which can be paid in two parts of $1100 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
19/10/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 9:10 am - +265 999 89 35 86: With the difference of only 1 person we would prefer that
19/10/23, 9:20 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 9:36 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Very much clear
19/10/23, 9:36 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Would also like to see the school structures like the rest
19/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we are coming to discuss that please. Moving ahead, Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 9:50 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Clear
19/10/23, 9:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2200 and so the balance fee becomes $2200 - $1000 = $1200 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
25/10/23, 6:29 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood. I hope you had a great celebration.
25/10/23, 6:55 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Alright. Noted
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 12:50 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Available
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: We can proceed
25/10/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are claar till here please?
25/10/23, 1:27 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Clear yes
27/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University, GGI, and MVN. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letters as a family yet?
27/10/23, 2:28 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Not entirely. Dad's been out working so we haven't had the chance to discuss in details. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 2:31 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Of course we started discussing only that we didn't finalise
27/10/23, 2:31 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: With the most of our votes going towards  GGI
27/10/23, 2:36 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: I can say we can go for GGI. MVN gave a 100℅ scholarship but the school surroundings are not impressive <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 2:41 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Exactly.
27/10/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are inclined towards GGI, it is a good choice please. Moving ahead, It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
27/10/23, 3:35 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Like i said earlier, we have had some doubts bcoz only 1 school gave us a 100℅ scholarship yet the offer letter from Edoofa to our daughter was 100℅ scholarship and was assured to receive multiple offers that we wld be able to choose. At this time we  seriously have LIMITED options bcoz the conditions are generally not what we were offered. This is giving us doubts to all other offers like the promise that our daughter will be looked after while in India. 

So somehow we are not sure if we are doing the right thing. 

So from the 3 choices, the cheaper offer was MVN. THE School structurea are not convincing to us hence not  a choice. 

GGI is offering 60℅ making it a raw deal since we were offered a 100℅ scholarship. 

Golgotias is even higher which wld even be better to just look for other schools ourselves since ita not giving what we were promised. 

So out of all the 3 choices given, the better option wld be GGI though not satisfied.
01/11/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 8:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand the intricacies involved in the registration process, especially across different countries. Your request to have this week to manage the completion of the registration process is duly noted. However, if you would be able to help me even further with the date by when you would be able to complete the payment, it would help me in discussing the same withwith the university officials as well please?
02/11/23, 8:18 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Morning Ma'am. 

What if you give us till Monday the 6th November
02/11/23, 8:18 am - +265 999 89 35 86: At the same time. Is there a way of doing direct transfers?
02/11/23, 8:19 am - +265 999 89 35 86: The ones we use card straight to that side. Either through Flywire or whatsoever means
02/11/23, 8:21 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Because when we use banks to do the transfers they deduct processing fees
02/11/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are certain about making the payment by 06th of November so that we can discuss about the mode of payment moving ahead?
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes we are sure
02/11/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, when it comes to the mode of payment, I believe we had already discussed it earlier while we were discussing the offer letter, right?
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes
03/11/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, do you have any queries that you wish to ask regarding the payment mode please?
03/11/23, 10:37 am - +265 999 89 35 86: I asked how can it be paid directly using card
03/11/23, 10:38 am - +265 999 89 35 86: At this point we r in the early registration program not so? With 150dollars off the total amount?
03/11/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, if you wish to make the payment using your Card, then, in that case, you can use either of the two methods:

1. PayPal
2. Direct Payment through Edoofa's Website (Available at www.edoofa.com)
03/11/23, 10:40 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Ok noted
03/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, as per the deadlines shared by the university, we are already past the due date of 31st October 2023, and ideally, the Early Decision Benefits are not available moving forward. However, if you would share your plan to complete the registration process with me here, I would help you in paving a way to get those benefits. I hope this is clear?
03/11/23, 12:22 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: We wanted to pay the whole amount at once
03/11/23, 12:23 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Since its a big process to make international payments
03/11/23, 12:23 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Hence looking for that privilege
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 5:37 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Good morning. Was wondering whats happening. 

Ok noted
07/11/23, 5:37 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Noted thanks.
07/11/23, 6:10 am - +265 882 05 59 00: Noted, thank you.
07/11/23, 7:05 am - +265 888 87 18 27: Good morning. The update is noted
07/11/23, 5:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 5:49 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Good evening. Yes we can go ahead. Am sure Michelle and Dad will join later since its going back hour here
07/11/23, 5:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, from our previous conversation, I recal that you had mentioned about completing the admission process by paying the registration fee amount, now, can you please help me in understanding more about the same as well? <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 5:53 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: We can proceed yes
07/11/23, 6:01 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: I had earlier on asked which amount are we paying since there are conditions and some of them may not go well with us because we always face forex issues. And it takes days or weeks to process payments and we really wish the early payment benefit procedure was accorded to us considering the fact that Michelle will start school next year and NOT THIS YEAR. Which in all sense still means early registration. But we didnt get any response. 

At the same time, we would love to pay full registration at once because of the same problem of forex stated above. We cant be doing that process again and again. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 6:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. However, on that note, I would like to ask how do you wish to proceed and complete Michelle's admission process so that I can help you with the same accordingly?
07/11/23, 7:17 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: We want to pay for GGI registration in full with EARLY PAYMENT BENEFIT. which gives a discount of 150 dollars
07/11/23, 7:18 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: With NO instalment
07/11/23, 7:18 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: At the same time we want a confirmation that this registration fees is part of the first Year's  fees as per Edoofa's conditions <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 7:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Understood. I will ensure that your preference for the early payment benefit and the wish to pay the full registration without installments is noted and communicated for a smooth admission process.

On top of that, I can assure you that the registration fee that will be paid will get adjusted in Michelle's first year fee as we have already shared with you, there is no worry on that.
07/11/23, 7:27 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 😍🙌🏼 thank you‼️
07/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. On that note, can you please let me know how is it that you are planning to complete the admission process now?

07/11/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, have you already shared your request for making the payment with the bank?
07/11/23, 8:16 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Yes, we started the process last week Wednesday. And yesterday we followed up
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, did you receive a payment slip from the bank for the payment as wel?
07/11/23, 9:32 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: We filled a form
07/11/23, 9:32 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: And left it with the Bank
07/11/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, is it possible for you to get that form?
07/11/23, 9:35 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Lets us try to do that tomorrow
07/11/23, 9:35 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: If the bank can give us. Or take  a picture
07/11/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you do that tomorrow, we will proceed with our discussion at that time. Until then, have a blessed evening.

14/11/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I trust you're having a good start to the day.

I wanted to follow up regarding the payment process we discussed. Have you received any update or confirmation from the bank regarding the finalization of the payment for the registration fees as of now?
14/11/23, 8:34 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Evening @919540716843 . 

We followed with the bank yesterday and they said all forex payments have delayed abit because of a major devaluation that has been effected here in Malawi on Friday by 40%. This will even a have huge negative impact on all payments. So we r hoping we get get helped soonest
14/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand the situation you're facing with the delayed forex payments due to the recent devaluation in Malawi. It's indeed a challenging circumstance impacting various transactions, including your payment for Michelle's registration fees.

I trust you're all doing well.

I was expecting a response from your side here earlier regarding the payment of the registration fee please. Therefore, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other here for discussing the same? <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Good Evening. Sorry been away too and couldn't connect
23/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: You can proceed
23/11/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. How have you been lately?
23/11/23, 9:15 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Been ok. Kind of occupied abit with exams since am also studying
23/11/23, 9:28 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Good evening! 

This has been such a hectic period. I was attending a two month face to face course on emergency response. Only back home today.

We are engaging as family so that we make up decision on Michelle's further studies. Currently the country is reeling under an acute 44% plus devaluation. There are still rumors there will be another devaluation given how bad our economy is performing.

On basis of above, we will look at our finance reserves and firewalls and assess the risks of an education abroad for our daughter.

We are scared the Malawi Kwacha is on a slippery slope and not promising to improve anytime soon. A case in point is that since we commenced discussion on Michelle's on-boarding, the Malawi Kwacha has been devalued twice. The picture is bleak and we're afraid the trend may make it even tougher and exorbitant for the family to sustain an international education.

We are hoping to finalize our plan over the weekend and will revert with a final stand on Monday.

Stay blessed 🙏 <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:54 am - +265 882 05 59 00: All good. How are you?
28/11/23, 8:55 am - Milan Edoofa: I am fine please, thank you for asking. Now, from the message that you had shared with me here the last time we had our discussion, you were to share an update with me here on your position about the preparation for Michelle's registration process. May I know if we can discuss that now?
28/11/23, 9:03 am - +265 999 89 35 86: Good morning @919540716843 

Yes we can. But if we can just wait for Michelle's Dad to update on the same. He is in a meeting for afew minutes. He will definitely give us an update soon. 

Since the ball is in our hands i guess?
28/11/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if his father is free now to have the discussion ahead?
28/11/23, 12:42 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Good afternoon!

I was supposed to communicate on way forward with Michelle's on boarding after our honest analysis and opinion on Malawi fragile economy.

We are at pains to acknowledge that it will be very expensive on our part financially to continue with the process. All our payments are in local currency and we have no guarantee if it's value given the current and on coming inflation status.

We there for regret to inform that much as we were excited and exuberant about the issue, we unfortunately can not cope for the reasons cited above.

We will continue to monitor the trends and will not hesitate to renew the process where things go in our favour.

It is our hope that once we have business in USD currency, which happens sometimes, we may rekindle our interest to support Michelle Edoofa aspirations.

Thanks for the wonderful and insightful discussion and guidance our daughter and us parents have had to date. 

We are hopeful you understand our situation and why we have to make this otherwise painful decision.

Stay blessed 🙏
