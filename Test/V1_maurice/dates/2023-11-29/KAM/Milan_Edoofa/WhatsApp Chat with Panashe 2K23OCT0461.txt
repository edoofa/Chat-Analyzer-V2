As for my family we live together in the medium density suburb of Waterfalls. I have 5 siblings and 3 of them are happily wedded.

12/10/23, 8:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *The admissions group (Panashe 2K23OCT0461)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
12/10/23, 8:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Earn While You Learn Program (Panashe EWYL23E0780)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.
12/10/23, 8:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
12/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes Its very clear
12/10/23, 8:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
12/10/23, 8:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
12/10/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 844 8064: The mission of Edoofa , providing quality education to students at an affordable cost. The likes of which the parents  would find difficult paying for tertiary education without the programme. It's impressive because the opportunity given to the student and lessen financial burdens to parents is a win win for everyone
12/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you were impressed by the impact of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. It's indeed gratifying to know that our program has played a pivotal role in shaping the future careers of numerous beneficiaries by making tertiary education more affordable. 

The mission of Edoofa is truly remarkable. It's dedicated to providing students with a high-quality education at an affordable cost, which is especially crucial in a world where education costs are constantly on the rise.
12/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
12/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 844 8064: Please do share
12/10/23, 9:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure Panashe, let me share all the documents with you one by one.
13/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Good day. I have finished watching the videos .

13/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I am available now
13/10/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263788448064. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
13/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright ....
In the first Video they spoke of qualities a student should have. These including the ability to follow instructions as they come. Students should be highly open minded with the potential to stand out from the immense competition among students. With the given illustration of Steve Jobs and how he sought for his opportunity from such a young age. The determination he had towards his task was enough to get him enrolled for a job , such attitude is to be expected from a student <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Panashe, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
13/10/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
13/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 844 8064: In the second video I noted how Edoofa not only helps their students with affordable education but also helps them by equipping them with necessary tools required in the work field after the academics . Edoofa helps their students to be the best among the rest of the competition
13/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright noted
13/10/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
13/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Edoofa spent lots of years acquiring the potential universities to provide quality education and hospitality to their students . Applying students should be able to understand the procedures as they come.
13/10/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
13/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Finally the the statement of purpose which is written solely by the applicant sharing much information about their personal achievements and why they are the appropriate student for the university the SOP is sent to. It is an important document that helps impress the university at which you would have the likelihood to educate at
13/10/23, 3:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
13/10/23, 3:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
13/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Agreed
13/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
13/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Thank you I will make the SOP and will make it ready by 9
13/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263788448064
13/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/KHeezTh5tWuARSKRyda6HI
14/10/23, 10:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Panashe Chinamhora, and my EWYL group name is Panashe EWYL23E0780. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Monday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
14/10/23, 10:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
14/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright thanks
14/10/23, 10:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Microbiology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
14/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 844 8064: Indeed that is so
14/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/10/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
14/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/10/23, 10:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 844 8064: Correct
14/10/23, 10:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
14/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
14/10/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
14/10/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
14/10/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
14/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright
14/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright
14/10/23, 10:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes. I noticed how my results haven't been put into consideration in the process till this stage
14/10/23, 11:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263788448064 your query will be attended as we proceed with our session. I hope that's okay <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 844 8064: It's okay
14/10/23, 11:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 11:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
14/10/23, 11:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/10/23, 11:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 844 8064: Delightful
14/10/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Panashe. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/10/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future
14/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes that's wonderful
14/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct Panashe. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 11:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes we can proceed
14/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 844 8064: My network had dropped
14/10/23, 11:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: No issues @263788448064Can we continue our discussion?
14/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes let continue
14/10/23, 11:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 11:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.
On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Panashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning yourself  as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright I follow
14/10/23, 11:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 11:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 11:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 844 8064: I follow
14/10/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 844 8064: Wow that's amazing
14/10/23, 11:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 11:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 11:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 844 8064: I understand
14/10/23, 11:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 844 8064: Explain further please
14/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I'd like more information
14/10/23, 11:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 11:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 11:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 11:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright understood
14/10/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 844 8064: Oh yes
14/10/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*


Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and the scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes it's clear
14/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this? <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Clear
14/10/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
14/10/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright
14/10/23, 12:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 844 8064: I'd like to know the expected dates I would be required to pay for the $500-$750
14/10/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I completely understand your concern regarding the expected payment dates, Let me help you understand. 

The payment for your registration process will be due after you receive your official offer letter from the university. This offer letter is a significant milestone as it confirms your admission and outlines the terms and conditions of your enrollment. Once you've carefully reviewed the offer and made your decision on which university you'd like to attend, the payment of $500-$750 will be required.
14/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 844 8064: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Mrs Aditi and she has scheduled my session for Monday-Friday 0830-0930*
14/10/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
14/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Thank you
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263788448064 are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Indeed
14/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, We will now diligently proceed with the necessary preparations for the application, ensuring it is tailored to your chosen course.

Rest assured that as soon as we receive updates from the recommended universities, we will promptly reconnect with you to share all the relevant information.
14/10/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
14/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Thank you
14/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome

14/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 2. Different types of microorganisms and how they are different from each other.

Microorganisms are tiny living organisms that can only be seen with a microscope. There are many different types of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses.

**Bacteria** are single-celled prokaryotes, which means that they do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria are very diverse and can be found in all types of environments, from the inside of our bodies to the bottom of the ocean.

**Archaea** are also single-celled prokaryotes, but they are different from bacteria in several ways. Archaea have different cell walls and membranes, and they use different metabolic pathways. Archaea are found in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt flats.

**Fungi** are eukaryotic microorganisms, which means that they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Fungi can be unicellular or multicellular. Some fungi are beneficial, such as the fungi that break down organic matter in the soil. Other fungi can cause diseases, such as athlete's foot and ringworm.

**Protozoa** are eukaryotic microorganisms that are typically single-celled. Protozoa are motile, meaning that they can move on their own. Some protozoa are beneficial, but others can cause diseases, such as malaria and dysentery.

**Algae** are eukaryotic microorganisms that are typically photosynthetic, meaning that they use sunlight to produce energy. Algae can be unicellular or multicellular. Algae are important food sources for many aquatic animals.

**Viruses** are not really considered to be living organisms. They are much smaller than other microorganisms and do not have their own cells. Viruses can only reproduce inside of other living cells. Viruses cause many diseases, such as the flu, measles, and AIDS.
14/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 3.Different types of bacteria and which part of the bacteria actually gets stained

There are many different types of bacteria, but they can be classified into two main groups: gram-positive and gram-negative.

**Gram-positive bacteria** have a thick cell wall made of peptidoglycan. Gram-positive bacteria stain purple when the Gram stain is used.

**Gram-negative bacteria** have a thinner cell wall made of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane. Gram-negative bacteria stain pink when the Gram stain is used.

The Gram stain is a differential staining technique that is used to identify bacteria. The Gram stain works by staining the peptidoglycan in the cell wall. Bacteria with a thick cell wall (gram-positive) will stain purple, while bacteria with a thinner cell wall (gram-negative) will stain pink.
14/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 4. The various cells in our body and which cells help in our immunity and how are they affected by disease:

There are many different types of cells in our body. Some of the most important cells for immunity include:

* **White blood cells:** White blood cells are responsible for fighting infection. There are many different types of white blood cells, each with a specific role in the immune system.
* **Macrophages:** Macrophages are white blood cells that engulf and destroy bacteria and other foreign invaders.
* **Neutrophils:** Neutrophils are white blood cells that are the first to respond to an infection. They kill bacteria and other foreign invaders by releasing chemicals.
* **Lymphocytes:** Lymphocytes are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that bind to specific pathogens and mark them for destruction.

Diseases can affect the immune system in a variety of ways. Some diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, can destroy white blood cells, making it difficult for the body to fight infection. Other diseases, such as cancer, can cause the immune system to malfunction <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 5.Why do medical practitioners give antibiotics in cases of a viral infection?

Antibiotics are medications that kill bacteria. They do not work against viruses. However, medical practitioners may sometimes give antibiotics to people with viral infections, such as the flu. This is because antibiotics can help to prevent bacterial infections from developing as a complication of the viral infection.

For example, people with the flu are more likely to develop bacterial pneumonia. By giving antibiotics to people with the flu, medical practitioners can help to prevent this complication from developing.

It is important to note that antibiotics should not be used routinely for viral infections. This is because overuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria <This message was edited>

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I went through it
18/10/23, 7:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Panashe. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes please
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 1.900
2.3years
3.300
4.750
18/10/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Panashe. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
18/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I do. Understand
18/10/23, 8:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
18/10/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/10/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Panashe, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Sure
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I understand
18/10/23, 9:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Panashe. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 9:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Yes I'm in Harare
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Thanks
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 844 8064: I have a question
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Panashe. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/10/23, 10:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, you mentioned that you have a query on your mind, I would like you to please go ahead and share the with me here in the group so that we can discuss the same.
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 78 844 8064: The semester fee is 1800  and the accommodation ranges from 2000-2500 on Campus. With the combined figures I see it's out of the 2000-3000 dollars range I was told of during the beginning sessions
18/10/23, 10:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up this concern, Panashe, and I can understand why you're interested in clarifying the costs. It is essential to note that the calculations you have made are specific to on-campus accommodation, which does indeed exceed the fee range mentioned in our earlier sessions. The cost of accommodation at Galgotias University tends to be on the higher side, making it less affordable for many students.
18/10/23, 10:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To provide a more transparent overview, let's break down all the fee components we've discussed and calculate the total cost of your education at Galgotias University considering the off-campus accommodation:

1. Annual Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Annual Examination Fee - $200
3. Annual Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

The total annual cost of education comes to $1,800 (tuition) + $200 (examination) + $800 (off-campus accommodation) = $2,800.
18/10/23, 10:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This breakdown should give you a comprehensive understanding of the expenses associated with your education and with this, it can clarify how the cost of education is still within the fee range shared with you earlier. I hope this addresses the query you had?
18/10/23, 10:53 pm - +263 78 844 8064: I also would want to clarify while we are on the same note that the off campus option does not cover for food services correct
18/10/23, 10:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: No, Panashe, you don't need to worry about the cost of food. It has already been included in the total cost we discussed earlier. We have taken into account all the basic expenses, such as your rent, food, Wi-Fi expenses, electricity, and water bills. You can rest assured that everything has been carefully considered, and there are no hidden costs. 

Your financial well-being is important to us, and we have planned everything meticulously to make your education affordable and comfortable. I hope we are together?
19/10/23, 12:15 am - +263 78 844 8064: Alright I understand
19/10/23, 9:09 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Panashe, let us now shift our focus to the payment modes and ensure that you have all the necessary details. After that, we can explore how the Earn While You Learn program can make your education more affordable. Hence, can you please let me know if you have taken note of my last message and if we can resume our discussion?
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 844 8064: sure we can
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India.

19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

22/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 844 8064: One of my friends wants to enroll for tertiary education through edoofa can you please send me the necessary information she requires
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the messages you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 09:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 844 8064: 9am is okay
26/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright that's okay I hope you enjoyed the festival
26/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response Panashe. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 9 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 844 8064: Alright I understand
30/10/23, 2:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds you well and in good spirits. I was hoping to receive your response following our conversation last Friday, but unfortunately, I did not receive any communication from your end. To ensure that we remain connected and are on the same page, I wanted to reach out once more.
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I wanted to enquire whether you had the opportunity to review my last message? I hope you realize that time is of the essence because your deadline for scholarship reservation is just around the corner - October 31, 2023, which is tomorrow. As your admission officer, we must provide the university with an update on your preparations, and hence, our communication is essential to facilitate this process.
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 844 8064: My apologies for not communicating. I had a really ill relative and spent most of my time with him at the hospital.
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 844 8064: On a sad note , most of the funds were spent to aid my nephew's medication which was really expensive. I doubt my parents can pay up by tomorrow
30/10/23, 5:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am so sorry to hear about your ill relative, and I truly hope they are on the path to recovery. Family emergencies take precedence, and it's completely understandable that you needed to be with your relative during this time. Regarding your nephew's medication expenses, I can imagine how financially challenging that must have been.

To assist you better, could you please provide more information about your nephew's condition, what happened to him and how long his treatment is expected to continue?
30/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 844 8064: He was diagnosed with TB and meningitis. The physician was to do some tests today and provide us with necessary information regarding his treatment
03/11/23, 1:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Panashe,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed your previous message where you mentioned your nephew's health issue and we are truly sorry to hear about your family member's health condition. It is essential to prioritize their well-being and ensure they receive the necessary medical care. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 1:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Since it has been a couple of days and you were expecting to receive test results to determine the course of treatment, I would like to follow up and inquire about the current status. How is your nephew doing now? Have there been any updates or developments regarding their treatment that you can share? 

Your insights will help us better understand your situation and provide the support you need for your university admission and your higher educational plans.
03/11/23, 1:23 am - +263 78 844 8064: Thank you for your concern. He was treated and is doing much better than last time. He was allowed to go home . And was prescribed some medication and strict diet. He does require further treatment for meningitis which I presume wasn't available at the particular hospital he got admitted to. Hence he was referred somewhere else . But as for now he is in much better shape
03/11/23, 1:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that he's doing much better and has been allowed to go home. It is a relief that he is responding positively to the treatment. It is good to know that he has been referred for further treatment for meningitis to ensure his full recovery.

With the improvement in his health and the medical care he is receiving, I believe now you must be in a position to focus on your university admission and higher educational plans?
03/11/23, 1:33 am - +263 78 844 8064: True , we can now proceed
03/11/23, 1:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Panashe. As you are aware this week was a significant week for you and your family, as it marked the deadline for your university registration fee, and making this payment in a timely manner is imperative to secure your admission and scholarship.

In this regard, we would like to follow up with you. Have you successfully completed the payment? If so, we kindly request you to share the payment receipt with us. This will aid us in updating the university and ensuring a smooth admission process for you.
03/11/23, 1:51 am - +263 78 844 8064: Unfortunately I hadn't made the payment...
03/11/23, 1:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Panashe, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. It's clear that you had to defer a few of the funds for your nephew's treatment and I can also imagine how crucial this scholarship opportunity is to you.

However, as you are aware missing the set deadlines does pose a risk to your scholarship, and I share your concerns. I am curious to know if your parents have discussed any alternative plans or solutions to address this situation. What are their thoughts on how to proceed in securing your scholarship seat now?

I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 08:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead.

I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?

17/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I was going through your discussion with Ms. Vilsha here earlier and I noticed that you were not able to make the payment of your registration fee on time. Can you please let me know the reason behind that?

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: It's been over five days since we last connected regarding the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, however, since I did not get any response from your side I was concerned about the same. 

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
