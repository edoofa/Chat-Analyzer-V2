21/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know and for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
21/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Oh yes of course sir!!
21/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Oh is it when we receive letters from  different universities and we have to choose one from them??
21/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
21/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 233 1484: We indeed are on the same page!
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Ready sir!!
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Okay
21/09/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Will do thank same to you sir
22/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Its alright good evening to you. Thank you have a lovely weekend as well
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Good good
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Ready when you are!!
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Yes, clear!
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Yes yes
25/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Hm I'm lost here
25/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! When you get the Offer Letter from the university, it will mention a registration fee. Let's say this fee is $750. However, you've been granted $150, so you only need to pay $600 instead of the full $750. After you pay $600, the university will treat it as if you paid the full $750, with Edoofa covering the remaining $150. This makes it easier for you to afford your university registration. Is that clear?
25/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Very clear thank you!!
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 233 1484: It's very clear please go on
25/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Please give me some more info
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Alright!!
25/09/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Yes right
25/09/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Agreed
25/09/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/09/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Very clear
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Yes yes clear
25/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Will do thank you. Pass my regards to your family as well. GD night
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Sorry my battery died had no way to communicate with you sir my apologies
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Ready if you are
27/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 233 1484: No! Not at the moment you cleared that for me. Thank you
27/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Kudzai's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Kudzai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?

I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Lovely Professional University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have started with our discussion regarding your offer letter from LPU. May I know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Good afternoon that is great indeed. Thank you. I'm sorry was away a few days ago due to a family crisis.
16/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Only I will need to communicate with Kudzai first because the program u have enrolled her there is not what she mentioned. Now she has started her exams today and she will only be free on the 15 of next month November. Is it possible we put this on hold until she comes now I'm afraid she has to be aware of what she is getting into please sir
16/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Oh okay but my worry is about the program sir. I don't know how we can proceed without talking to Kudzai yet sir
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Kudzai!
I trust you're all doing well.

It's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 07:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead.
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
18/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 400 4790: Good day ever since l received the acceptance letter l have been meaning to ask that the letter mentioned me pursuing medical laboratory technology instead of bachelor of cardiovascular technology .
18/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 400 4790: Is there a way of correcting that or not
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and KUdzai!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
25/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding Kudzai's admission process.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here now so that we can transition to the next steps in the admission journey?
25/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 400 4790: Good day ever since l received the acceptance letter l have been meaning to ask that the letter mentioned me pursuing medical laboratory technology instead of bachelor of cardiovascular technology .
Is there a way of correcting that or not
25/11/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, on that note, I believe we already had a discussion, right?
25/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 400 4790: No we didn't have the discussion
25/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 400 4790: We believe the program which we had discussed was the program we expected to see in the acceptance letter but that was not the case
28/11/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 11:49 am - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delayed response. I was unexpectedly caught up in urgent work that required my immediate attention. I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and I take full responsibility for it.
28/11/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me here. On that note, I would like to mention that as I had already informed you of this earlier, that we had indeed shared your applications with our partner universities for the course Cardiovascular Technology, however, since you were not eligible for the same course, your application was then accepted for the course B.Sc. MLT and the offer letter for the same was received. I hope this is understood?
28/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 400 4790: Okay thank you sir  what l wanted to study is Cardiovascular technology so in that case l would like to withdraw this application  and apply elsewhere please!
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: About that Kudzai, I would like to mention that, I understand that you wished to study Cardiovascular Technology, however, since you are not eligible for pursuing the same, in that case, you won't be able to do it anywhere else too. 

Therefore, can you please let me know what would you wish to do in that case?
