27/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well. 

Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yiu You can proceed sir
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir, they are
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am sir
27/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes they are sir, thank you
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes please
27/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

29/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Okay sir
29/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 653 0616: I got to understand the issue of listening and following instructions. Inorder to get the skills and the opportunity to aim higher, you ought to refer to the experts. And Edoofa are the experts when  it comes to helping students with their  higher education. Edoofa has worked so hard, for ten years, making sure that they get linked and connected to univerties that have got the best learning base or foundation for students. Edoofa  makes sure that students get enrolled in universities where English is the main language of instruction, where there is proper accommodation for  students. Also making sure that students gets the best classes. Edoofa is there to make students employable, by working on the students' character, and they make sure that in the long run, students will be able to have the knowledge and the skills that are practical that enables them to get employed at ease. Edoofa makes education affordable and this is topped up further by the Earn while you learn program. It brings out the best within pupils.
29/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes we are sir

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

29/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Thank you sir
29/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Have a great holiday
04/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?

04/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Am not home Sir but knowing Melisa very well, she did that Sir.
04/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know by when she might be able to share the tasks with me ?

E. Tsvangirai
05/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking.
05/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to fill out the online SOP form as well?
05/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Sorry sir, I forgot about that form

09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Evening sir. Indeed we had a restful weekend.
09/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am available
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes you are correct sir.
09/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
09/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am sir.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Warm Greetings Sir. 
Indeed we had a good and restful weekend Sir. Apologies for the delayed response from our corner as parents due to a lot work commitments Sir.
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Warm greetings to you as well. I completely understand the demands of work commitments, and I'm glad to hear you had a restful weekend. Your daughter's academic journey is of great importance to us, and we're here to assist and support in any way we can.
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I am finding the discussion very helpful since our decision as a family is based on such critical information Sir. We really appreciate the stages that are extremely informative indeed.
09/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir
09/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Very we are on the same page Sir.
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Well understood Sir. We are following up well indeed.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Well noted sir
09/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 365 9499: Yes it is not possible sir
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Well noted with thanks sir.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 653 0616: No I don't have any queries sir.
09/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Thank you sir
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir, I am ready. Thank you.
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 653 0616: We can proceed sir.
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Melisa's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Sounds amazing sir
09/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 653 0616: I think you mistook me for Blessing right there sir.
09/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, thank you for pointing out the error. I have corrected the same.
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Don't mention it sir.
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I liked the way the young lady (Melisa) is following up. That shows an epitome of concentration indeed.
09/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, diligence and persistence are key qualities that will serve Melisa well in her academic journey. It's great to see her dedication and proactive approach towards securing her future.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Thank you sir
09/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Assuredly Sir. Thank you Sir.
09/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Good night to you too sir. Thank you.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Good afternoon sir. 
Yes we can.
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Well noted Sir. The piece of information is quite helpful indeed.
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes it does.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I have sir, thank you
10/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 346 7191: It all looks quite set and understandable Sir.
10/10/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 653 0616: I would like you to provide me with that information sir.
10/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes sir, thank you.
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I do sir
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am sir
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am sir
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Well noted sir
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 653 0616: No I do not have any queries sir.
10/10/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Yes I am, thank you.
10/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 653 0616: Noted with thanks sir.
10/10/23, 10:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Melisa EWYL23E0709*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

17/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Afternoon Sir.
My apologies for the delay in joining the group for the noble discussion Sir. I have been extremely busy.
However, I went through the letter well and it sounds like the Offer Letter is fine indeed. The only underpinning clause that needs clarity is that of the payment of the $750.00 "within the next 15 days Sir. I am not if there could be that leeway for a payment plan Sir. As it is now, we have to make a balance and final of $179.00 before or on the 22nd October 2023 after the initial $200.00 paid in September 2023.
17/10/23, 4:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I understand that. Now, to make sure that you can have a clarity on that, shall we move ahead to discuss the letter?
17/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: That should fine Sir.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know by when will you be sharing the same with me here so that we can move ahead?
18/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Evening Sir. 
I have realised that the annual tuition fee is $1225.00 and the Hostel fee is 1200.00 respectively Sir.
18/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I have also noted that the same figues are meant to be the same for the four semesters in fact.
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please also share the registration fee mentioned in the letter.
19/10/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 346 7191: Good Morning Sir.
Very true, I also saw a registration fee of $750.00 of which fhe payment structure was not clearly explained since there can be a challenge to get it paid at once within a short time Sir.
19/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Evening Sir. 
Very true. I will avail myself for the session in question.
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Melisa!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Evening
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 346 7191: We are ready.
19/10/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
19/10/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
19/10/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200+ $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200 + $1000) = $2225.
20/10/23, 7:26 am - +263 77 346 7191: Really fantastic and under normal circumstances, the four seater will ideally good since it has a relief in the payment of slightly ness.
20/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Very clear from a parent perspective and i have no doubt that the student is finding it crystal clear too.
20/10/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2225 and so the balance fee becomes $2225 - $1000 = $1225 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
20/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 346 7191: On her behalf, I want to believe that this is quite a milestone into the supposed big figures. It eases the financial burden indeed.
20/10/23, 5:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
20/10/23, 5:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2225, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2225 - $750= $1475, and that can be paid in two parts of $737 & $738 at a gap of 6 months. 

Are we on the same page here as well?
20/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 346 7191: We are together yes.
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 29th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks for the clear message and am sure that we will ve given time to settle the $750
20/10/23, 10:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 10:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I reside in Harare.
20/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks for the connection. I really appreciate.
20/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 346 7191: True. We really appreciate Sir.
20/10/23, 11:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi

20/10/23, 11:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 11:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I do not seem to have any queries Sir. You have explained very well for us Sir.
20/10/23, 11:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

20/10/23, 11:17 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Quite inspiring indeed .
20/10/23, 11:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/10/23, 11:20 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks for sharing Sir. The student will go through the rest of the updates tomorrow Sir. It has been s pleasure having you along Sir. 
Parent.

21/10/23, 8:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from GGI. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from GGI as a family yet?
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.

I Was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter from GGI. Now, moving ahead, shall we continue with our conversation here about the same?
23/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 346 7191: Good Morning 
Apologies for the late response due to poor and eratic network. I normally find it easy to get such messages when I am at work where there is access to efficient network in fact.
23/10/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 346 7191: Having said thus, you can go ahead with the session as I will be interactive too though I may sightly would be behind due to pressure of work.
23/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 346 7191: At the same time, Melisa has a tight schedule over her exams and would be amongst us when she gets over her exams of the day.
23/10/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. Now, on that note, can you please let me know if you were able to have a discussion about the offer letter as a family?
24/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 365 9499: Good evening, noted with thanks
24/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 365 9499: Thank you
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Greetings.
I really appreciate your time and effort for trying to make this whole thing workable but this whole week I am pretty tied up for availability during the 9am to 15:00 hours sessions because of the work assignments I am into please. I am not quite sure if there could be an alternative schedule so that parents and student would not at least fail to be part of the sessions since they are extremely important too.
26/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks for understanding our plight. Can we make it for 15:30 hours for today. Tomorrow the early hour is ok.with me.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Yes Mam. We can
26/10/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Very true. As a father, I had a discussion with the mother and the student (Melisa) and we have noted that there  figures that need to be paid on specific dates for sure. However, I have further noted that with the way we had structured our payment for Melisa's enrollment balance of $150 on the 22nd October 2023 was based on the mutual arrangement with Mr. Austin who advised that the second student being a brother to Melisa (Lackson Takunda Tsvangirai) 's $100.00 enrollment fee should be taken from the same $150 we had paid. This then meant that Melisa Tariro Tsvangirayi's balance of $100.00 would be paid for by end of October 2023 since the $50 would have been pushed over to Melisa's intial payment of $200 thereby making it $250.00. With this place, it means that Lackson's other 100.00 will be paid in the month of November at the same time we are supposed to be paying the $750.00 which has been split into two payment planning at $300.00 at a time. I am not quite sure if such dates would be met financially. I therefore look forward to hearing from you how such a matter of a financial should be dealt with please?
03/11/23, 9:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: @263773467191 As per the discussion that we just had over call regarding Melisa's admission process, I hope you now have a proper understanding of how do we wish to move ahead with that. 

Moving ahead, as you had mentioned that you will first have a discussion with your wife and then you would be able to share an update with me on your position as well as your preparation to complete the admission process in the coming days. Moreover, based on the update that you will share with me here, we will then work towards drafting a payment plan for you that would suit your preparations. I hope this is understood, right?
03/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 346 7191: Good Morning Sir.
Millennium thanks for noble discussion we have telephonically and we really appreciate your great favours you are extending to us. I have heard what you have share with us over our daughter Melisa's enrollment/registration fees. We are aleady behind  but we want to revert back to you on Monday over the steps we are going to take in ensuring that we are back on the payment terms Sir. 
However, from today up to Sunday, we will not be able to be on the platform for sessions following a family member (my sister)'s death in South Africa whose body will be in Zimbabwe tomorrow Saturday for burial on Sunday morning. Just after the event, I will be back into Harare for another discussion based on our update towards the payment of the first $300.00, an issue which we think can be further looked into for easier payment plan Sir, that is if you allow us.
Once more, many thanks for giving us the opportunity to solidify our daughter's seat Sir.
03/11/23, 12:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263773467191, my heartfelt condolences on the loss of your sister. Please take all the time you need during this period to focus on your family and attend to your sister's final rites. Family always comes first, and your priority should be towards the rituals and paying your respects.

We understand the challenging situation you are going through. We empathize with your circumstances and respect the need for you to prioritize family commitments during this challenging period.
03/11/23, 12:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: When you're ready and have the capacity to continue discussions about Melisa's admission process and payment terms, we will be here to assist and support you through every step. Your daughter's educational journey is important, and we're committed to ensuring a seamless path forward once you're prepared.
03/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Very many thanks for all the initiatives that are meant to enable us pay the figures in question Sir.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 7:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Melisa!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Evening 
Very true. I am available for the session. I have had to put aside all my administrative work for this noble discussion for sure.
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are so willing to discuss the same. Moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding more about the payment plan that you have thought in order for completing Melisa's admission process?
07/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 346 7191: By end of this week I look forward to have raised at least $150 to $200 of the $300. It is never simple but I need to commit myself to the goal in fact.
07/11/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, once you would have raised the $200, by when do you think you would be able to make that payment?
07/11/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Latest by Saturday I assume.
08/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, once you are done with the same please let me know.
08/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because after that, on the basis on the payment, I would be able to discuss the matter with the academic board and make sure to confirm Melisa's admission.
08/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Good Evening 
Thanks for the feedback. I am working flatout to make a payment $200.00 soonest so that you can go ahead with the next stalled stage Mum.
08/11/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is why I wanted to know if you are certain about the same?
09/11/23, 6:15 am - +263 77 346 7191: I have understood you then.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks a lot for notice and we really appreciate that noble sharing. We will try to observe that as we support our daughter who is going to be in India for her Studies  in fact.
15/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Melisa!
I hope you've had a wonderful few days and a joyous Diwali celebration filled with light and happiness.

As we resume our discussions today, I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the pending matters related to the admission process. May I know if we can resume with our discussions now?
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Warm Greetings Sir.
True that we have a few days of a break but definitely we are going to transact $200.00 by Friday afternoon as I am looking forward to some little earnings I am expecting on Friday morning Sir.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, are you certain about the same?
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 346 7191: True to say Sir. We have to commit ourselves to the payment of such Sir.
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, once you are done with the payment on Friday, please let me know.
15/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 346 7191: Thanks a lot Sir.
28/11/23, 8:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:27 am - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had here earlier about completing the payment of your registration fee and moving ahead with the next steps in your admission process, you were planning to complete the payment of the first part of your fee on Friday, however, it has been over four days since then and I have not received any response on that from your side. 

Hence, may you please let me know by when can I expect an update from your end on that?
28/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 346 7191: Warm greetings Sir. 
Things have been extremely tough Sir but a deposit of $200. 00 and plus will be done today or early tomorrow Wednesday Sir. I have it with me but it needs to be handed over to Melisa's mother this morning when I briefly get into town Sir.
My apologies for the delay Sir.
28/11/23, 12:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. On that note, once you are done with the payment of the fee, please let me know.
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 346 7191: I will definitely let you know Sir.
