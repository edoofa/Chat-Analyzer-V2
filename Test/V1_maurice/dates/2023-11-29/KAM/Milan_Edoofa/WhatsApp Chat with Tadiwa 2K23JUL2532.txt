For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
02/08/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 226 8770: I'm done
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes they are clear
02/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes I am following
02/08/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/08/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 226 8770: On this one
So I have to pay before coming to India
02/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Noted
02/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263712268770 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
02/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
02/08/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/08/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes we can proceed
02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

02/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

03/08/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you were able to go through the 4 videos by now?
03/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Am doing well thank you

Yes I have gone through all the videos
03/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well, great so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
03/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Ok let me do that quickly
03/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Important message for the students

This is to make sure the student is independent from the parents through the earn while you learn program.
Students are encouraged to be open minded and willing to go an extra mile.
There are two key points
1. Following instructions
2. Ask from the experts
03/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Edoofa's vision for me

Equipment of students with many skills relevant for impact and expansion
For edoofa aims not only to give students affordable education or making them employable through SEELs program 

But it is also focused on increasing their capacity for success thereby making them responsible and independent
03/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program

There are universities that are only concerned with making money. 
People that are business minded only but without the necessary requirements or resources to cater for the students.
But Edoofa assist the Edofians in identifying the right university.
It is working with the universities for excellence to prevail
03/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Preparation for interactive sessions with schools

This is all about the statement of purpose the document that will be sent to schools for you to be accepted or given a scholarship.
The statement of purpose should be convincing enough
03/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 715 9737: I think I am through with the summary we can proceed
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. 	
I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Following

03/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Okay that's great
03/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

04/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/08/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Following
04/08/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Ok i understand
04/08/23, 10:38 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes
04/08/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
04/08/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
04/08/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
04/08/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Following
04/08/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Following
04/08/23, 10:42 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes we discussed about it
04/08/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Meaning I can get the offer letter without my advanced level results
04/08/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand, yes Since your year of intake is 2024, and as for your A-level, you will be appearing for that this year and so your A- level statement of entry along with your O- level will be required for the universities to generate your offer letter.

I hope we are clear here?
04/08/23, 11:20 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes we are sir thank you
04/08/23, 11:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
04/08/23, 11:38 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes I understand
04/08/23, 11:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
04/08/23, 11:41 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Crystal clear
04/08/23, 11:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 11:42 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes am following
04/08/23, 11:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
04/08/23, 11:43 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Everything is clear no questions yet
04/08/23, 11:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
04/08/23, 11:46 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Thank you very much Sir we will definitely discuss everything
04/08/23, 11:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
04/08/23, 11:48 pm - +263 78 715 9737: What would possibly the time we are starting the EWYL tomorrow

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
18/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Good afternoon my admission officers

I hope this message finds each of you in good health. I want to apologize for my recent absence and my inability to connect with you. I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us? <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 226 8770: It's okay ma'am

I am available
07/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 226 8770: We will be expecting the offer letter
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
07/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 226 8770: I have reviewed them all
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of the Student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tadiwa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 226 8770: That's interesting
07/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 226 8770: Yes it does
07/10/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/10/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 226 8770: Yes ma'am
07/10/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/10/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/10/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 226 8770: I am following
We are on the same page
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 226 8770: This message was deleted
07/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 226 8770: I am not aware

You can share the information
07/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes it is clear now
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
07/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes I agree
07/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Let's say a student managed to get 15 points what type of schoolarship will be given to that student
07/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
07/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 226 8770: We are
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes l am
07/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Okay

I am learning
07/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 226 8770: We can move forward ma'am
No queries for now
07/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Tadiwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tadiwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes we are excited
07/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Okay ma'am thank you🙏
07/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/10/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwa.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwa!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias Univeristy by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
16/10/23, 8:19 am - +263 71 226 8770: Good day to you all 

I am sorry I was offline
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. May I know if you were able to do through the offer letter by now?
16/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes
16/10/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 715 9737: 1 . $900
2.5year course
3.300
4. $750
16/10/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Thank you
16/10/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 715 9737: Yes am clear
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 715 9737: But I request another offer letter
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 715 9737: From a different university
17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, dear, on that note, if I may ask why is that you wish to get another offer letter please?
18/10/23, 6:00 am - +263 71 226 8770: Good morning my Admission Officers

I would like to  choose from either two or more universities comparing their fees and also to choose the one that suits our financial situation
18/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes it is clear
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes thank you very much

It is now crystal clear
18/10/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 226 8770: I am not aware
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
18/10/23, 5:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear about how the admission process is carried out, right?
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
18/10/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, I believe your query must be clear that you had here, right?
18/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes it is
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
18/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 226 8770: So the examination fee is not of part the fees
18/10/23, 5:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, it is not a part of the tuition fee, rather, it is included in the total costs of education. I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
18/10/23, 5:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
18/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes we are
18/10/23, 5:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 5:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 5:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 6:07 am - +263 71 226 8770: Yes
19/10/23, 6:07 am - +263 71 226 8770: Good morning to you all
19/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwa!

23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwa!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Yes
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How have you been doing?
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Better
How about you
23/11/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am doing fine as well, thank you for asking. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Yes we can
23/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier when we were discussing about Tadiwa's admission process, you had mentioned that since Tadiwa is writing exams, we could not move ahead at that time. Now, on that note, may you please let me know how is it that you are planning to complete the admission process now?
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Yes we do have plans for that
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, can you please let me know how are you planning to complete the admission process now?
23/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 376 9178: We will be following your lead
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, can you please let me know how much money have you raised till now for Tadiwa's admission process?
23/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 376 9178: $300
23/11/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here. Now, as you have already raise $300, I believe you have the first part of the registration fee with you. In that case, don't you think that paying the first part and securing Tadiwa's scholarship seat is important?
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Yes it is
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note by when do you think you would be able to pay the first part of the registration fee please?
23/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 376 9178: Two weeks from now
