Along with Mr. Milan (Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Senior Admission Officer), Mr. Jyotishman (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

04/08/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Shubham, and he did brief me about Faith's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
04/08/23, 4:49 pm - +260 97 7601316: Well, all our counselling went on very well. We really appreciated and liked the opportunities we were given to ask alot of questions so that we could understand what edoofa is all about.
04/08/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I’m delighted to know that you had such a great experience! Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
04/08/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Faith 2K23JUL1361)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
04/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Faith EWYL23E0402)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
04/08/23, 7:56 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
04/08/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two Whatsapp groups.

05/08/23, 1:06 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form, may I know if you were able to fill out the Student application form by now?
05/08/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it's filled in
08/08/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier and thank you for sharing the student application form it is duly noted with us. Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
08/08/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are available
08/08/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
08/08/23, 12:27 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes we can
08/08/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes iam
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
08/08/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it is clear
08/08/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
08/08/23, 2:58 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

08/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.30 pm, I hope by that time you will be able to go through the videos.

09/08/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what is the challenge that you are facing?

10/08/23, 7:37 am - +260 97 7414512: 11AM

11/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you will be available.
11/08/23, 1:13 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay noted
14/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you are doing well, I really appreciate your understanding and Patience so may I know if you are available to connect with us now to proceed ahead with the discussion?
14/08/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are available
14/08/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
14/08/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes I did go through them
14/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
14/08/23, 3:13 pm - +260 97 7414512: The first learning given in the first video the stoodents that they want should be teachable and open-minded
The second learning  from the first video is that the students should follow edoofa instructions as edoofa is assisting the students so as to enable them to get the most out of their experience of higher education.

In the second video, the vision of edoofa is expressed. Edoofa has a vision of not  only giving students affordable quality education and making students employable through the ' Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success' programme, but it too focuses on increasing the students' capacity for success therefore making the students more responsible and independent 

The third video of the series teaches us that the students that the students must understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. The founders also encourage  the students to follow instructions so as to be adequately  prepared and qualified for the prestigious  institutions which Edoofa is offering. The information  gathered during the counselling is used.

The fourth and final video  mainly focuses on the statement  of purpose and urges the student to be prompt in taking action, and to be delligent in filling out the form.
14/08/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/08/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/08/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered
14/08/23, 5:08 pm - +260 97 7414512: Well noted
14/08/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/08/23, 8:01 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
14/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Wednesday at 01.00 pm.
14/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
14/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and the academic documents may I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form also I was going through your academic documents and I noticed that you have shared your grade 12 result, may I know by when will you be able to share your grade 10 result?
16/08/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us.  I was going through your academic documents and I noticed that you have shared your grade 12 result, may I know by when will you be able to share your grade 10 result?
16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Science in Computer Science for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 3:22 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 7414512: True
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 7414512: Ok
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +260 97 7414512: Well noted
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it was very clear
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1200-$1500 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - +260 97 7414512: I thought after the registration fee is paid it will be deducted from the tuition fee in the first year $1800-$750+$1000=2050
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain you further.  As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 4:21 pm - +260 97 7414512: Am following
16/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 4:23 pm - +260 97 7414512: It's clear
16/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 4:37 pm - +260 97 7414512: Looking forward
17/08/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Faith. 

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

21/10/23, 9:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Faith,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/10/23, 12:49 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes we are available
21/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes, we do remember
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 7414512: Please do a recap 
Your processes are too long to a point were one can give up
21/10/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are ready
21/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
21/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $1000, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 1:50 pm - +260 97 7414512: It's clear
21/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $1200 to $1500, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
21/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1350 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $0 = $1350 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $1000 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $1350 - $1000 = $350. You can pay this $350 within the first three days of your arrival in India.
21/10/23, 1:58 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
21/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 7414512: Noted
23/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Faith,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Since we were not able to complete our conversation on Saturday we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Faith,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
26/10/23, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are available
26/10/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are clear so far?
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are clear
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 7414512: Well noted
26/10/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7414512: Very much available
27/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, grade 10 and 12 results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Faith, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/10/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
27/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 7414512: Noted
27/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 4:02 pm - +260 97 7414512: We are available
27/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 4:51 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it does
27/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Faith,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - +260 97 7414512: its all clear
27/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/10/23, 9:51 am - +260 97 7414512: Please provide more information
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
30/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it's clear
30/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/10/23, 5:05 pm - +260 97 7414512: No
30/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 5:11 pm - +260 97 7414512: Noted
30/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/10/23, 5:17 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes it's clear
30/10/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 5:42 pm - +260 97 7414512: It is clear
30/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 6:22 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
30/10/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 7:00 pm - +260 97 7414512: No questions
30/10/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Faith's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Faith is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/10/23, 7:10 pm - +260 97 7414512: Looking forward
30/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.

20/11/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
20/11/23, 1:16 pm - +260 97 7414512: The admission and processing fee should be paid within 15 days this is before her  results are out. What happens if she won't qualify and the payment has been made
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Faith!
I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting your acknowledgment to proceed with our discussion earlier yesterday, however, since I did not receive one, we could not move ahead with our discussion here. 

May I know if we can move ahead with our conversation here now?
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 7414512: I did acknowledge
21/11/23, 3:06 pm - +260 97 7414512: I even asked a question
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 7414512: Which was not attended to
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7414512: I also asked this question
22/11/23, 9:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Faith!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter? <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 10:14 am - +260 97 7414512: We very much available
22/11/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, let me help you with your queries here one by one please.
22/11/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to this query of yours, I believe it was discussed by Ms. Kirti during the discussion about the admission process as well as the Endowment Plan Benefits, right?
22/11/23, 10:35 am - +260 97 7414512: Are you saying it can't be discussed again
22/11/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: No, please, I am first helping you recall that it was discussed earlier as well so that I can help you get more clarity on that, do you remember the same?
22/11/23, 10:43 am - +260 97 7414512: Yes
22/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Can you please recall what were the steps that were shared to you that in case a student completes the registration process and does not manage to get the desired results, what would be the solution to that?
22/11/23, 10:47 am - +260 97 7414512: This
22/11/23, 10:48 am - +260 97 7414512: That
22/11/23, 10:48 am - +260 97 7414512: And that
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, as you have read above in these mentioned points, if a student manages not to pass their A-Level Exams but have paid the registration fee, then, in that case, one of these options are open to be utilized by the student so that they can plan their higher education journey accordingly. I hope this is clear?
22/11/23, 10:52 am - +260 97 7414512: Yes it is
22/11/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I believe you are clear with your first query, right?
22/11/23, 11:00 am - +260 97 7414512: Yes
22/11/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, let us come to your second query here. When it comes to the issue of scholarship percentage, I would like to mention that we have shared your scholarship with multiple universities with the request to grant you with a 100% scholarship. 

Apart from that, since this is the first offer letter that you have received, and that Galgotias has offered you a 50% scholarship, you might as well be getting other offer letters as well with an increased scholarship percentage. I hope this is understood?
22/11/23, 11:08 am - +260 97 7414512: My question is what was the 100% scholarship offer that was given at first
22/11/23, 11:09 am - +260 97 7414512: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: The letter that you had shared earlier with me here was your Edoofa Scholarship Acceptance Letter that signifies that you have been selected for being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and that you are guaranteed a scholarship from our side. On that note, your application has already been shared with our multiple partner universities including the oned for 100% scholarship, and once we will receive a response from their side, we will let you know. 

As of now, the first letter that you have received is from Galgotias Univeristy and they have presented you with a 50% scholarship. Is that clear? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Faith!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the conversation that we were having here earlier yesterday, may I know if we can connect with each other here in order to move ahead with our discussion about the offer letter so that we can proceed to the next steps in your admission process?
23/11/23, 3:09 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
23/11/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7414512: Though I  have another question
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 7414512: If we pay towards this scholarship and another better offer shows up what happens
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here please. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out:

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 7414512: Okay
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 7414512: Was not aware
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +260 97 7414512: Understood
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I now believe that you have proper clarity on how the admission process is carried out, right?
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
23/11/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, may I know if we can move ahead to discuss the offer letter as well so that you can get clarity on all the other aspects as well?
23/11/23, 4:45 pm - +260 97 7414512: Yes
23/11/23, 4:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. For that, may I know if you have gone through the offer letter please?
24/11/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Faith!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter and proceed with the next steps in your admission journey. 

May I know if we can connect with each other here now for the same so that we can proceed with our conversation?
24/11/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 7414512: Am sorry today am having a very busy day
24/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here. I understand that you are busy in your day, however, on that note, would you be able to connect with me here for an hour or so before today 09.30 PM please?
28/11/23, 8:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Faith!
I hope this message finds you well.

It's been over three days since we last connected regarding your offer letter and the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, but I'm reaching out to express my concern and ensure everything is alright on your end.

I value our communication and want to ensure you have all the information and support you need to make an informed decision about your education. On that note, I'm available to connect with you at your convenience. Please let me know when you're available for a brief discussion. <This message was edited>
