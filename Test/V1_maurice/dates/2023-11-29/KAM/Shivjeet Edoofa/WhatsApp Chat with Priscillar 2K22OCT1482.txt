To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much for the admission cycle l now remember the steps very
26/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
26/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 807 4436: The admission team will send the student's documents and the Statement Of Purpose to several universities for evaluation and admission process,then an offer letter will be issued by the University that has accepted the student
26/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 807 4436: We will be very excited to get an offer letter,thank you very much
26/09/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
27/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I have viewed the benefits and l am happy about them
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes it is very clear
27/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l understand and it sounds good
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It is very clear and we are pleased to here that
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 807 4436: You have explained clearly,l really appreciate
27/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,thank you for the update,l will  greet them on your behalf,have a pleasant weekend
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,l am sorry for delaying,my phone was off we had no electricity,l am ready now
03/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, thank you for letting me know. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
03/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Please provide more information
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
03/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l can see that,thank you for the explanation
03/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l understand those options
03/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
04/10/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Priscillar . 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
04/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,l am available we can proceed
04/10/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
04/10/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
04/10/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
04/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It's very clear thank you very much for the clear explanations
04/10/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It's very clear thank you very much for explaining very well
04/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I have a question on the number of points to be attained buy the student in order to qualify for the bachelor's degree.if not mistaken you said it used to be 6 points but because of cobid 19 the points were reduced to 2
04/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am afraid you have misunderstood. It was the enrollment fee that was reduced to $350 due to the pandemic.
04/10/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
04/10/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Ok l will look for the statement and reread it
04/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much,same to you
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,we are fine thank you
05/10/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. If you are ready shall we proceed with the session.
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I am ready we can proceed
05/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 807 4436: No for now l don't have any queries
05/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Priscillar's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Priscillar is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
05/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes yes l am very curious to receiving the offer letter..we.will.be very happy if she benefits from the endowment.
05/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Priscillar's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Priscillar.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by MVN University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:59 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 807 4436: Waaaal💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽we are really thrilled as a family to receive such exciting news.We are very grateful
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Priscillar!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from MVN Univeristy by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I was able to go through the offer letter and available for discussion
14/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
14/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/10/23, 7:51 am - +263 77 807 4436: Good morning,l am sorry for delaying:
1) $1000
2) $ 0
3) $ 2250
4) $ 125
5) $ 1000
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 25% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $1000.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Priscillar!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through this message of mine so that we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from MVN?
17/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,yes we managed to go through the message
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $2250 + $250 = $2500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $2250. I hope you are clear about that?
18/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,yes it's clear and thank you for making it even clearer
18/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes it is very clear.l have a question, initially we were told that Priscillar will receive a number of  offer letters from different Universities and we will be assisted to choose the best is it so?
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the query with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that we will discuss the same moving ahead during our conversation. Will that be okay with you please?
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes it is fine
18/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Priscillar!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,yes we will be available at  7:30 PM
19/10/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Priscillar!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 7:46 am - +263 77 807 4436: Good morning,l am very sorry l couldn't make it yesterday my battery was flat and we had no electricity
20/10/23, 12:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Priscillar!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. If I may ask shall we proceed with our discussion here?
20/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 807 4436: ,yes it is fine we can proceed
20/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we do that, if I may ask, are you clear till here please?
20/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes very clear
20/10/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $2250 and so the balance fee becomes $2250 - $1000 = $1250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l understand,the EWYL program is of great help
20/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2500 - $1000 = $1500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
20/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l understand
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 807 4436: May you please explain how we came to $850
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, when it comes to the registration fee at MVN University, I would like to mention that at the time your application was processed, your counselor had shared a special recommendation for a higher quantum of scholarship. Now, when it comes to the $500-750 registration, it is true that it lies within that range, however, since the opportunity that you have received is an exclusive opportunity and the university is offering a 75% scholarship on the tuition as well as 100% sponsorship on accommodation fee, therefore, the registration fee, in this case, is towards a higher end. I hope this is clear now?
20/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Ok
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 807 4436: No l stay in Gweru
20/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much
20/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes please send,l.prefer the second mode
20/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 516 5978: No l don't have go ahead
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 807 4436: Yes we are discussing at every stage
21/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 807 4436: The family would like to know what the University will do if the student fails to attain the 6 points as per requirement
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Priscillar!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to know if you recall the discussion that you had with Ms. Kirti during the conversation about the admission process
23/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 807 4436: Good morning,Do you.mean the one concerning endowment
23/10/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. I am sure that she must have helped you in understanding the same, that in case a student fails to get enough points in A-Level, what had to be done in that situation, right?
23/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 807 4436: I understood the three options the student will have,my question is:will the University reserve the place if the student decides to resit for A level,if the student goes to a college will there be a refund
23/10/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you've had a clear understanding of the options available. To answer your question, yes, if a student decides to resit for A-level and informs the university about this choice, the scholarship seat will still be reserved for them. I hope this is understood?
23/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Well understood,thank you
23/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries to ask please?
23/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 807 4436: What is if the student decides to attend a college instead of the University
23/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please be a bit more clear on what you are trying to say here?
23/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I understand the other option is that if the student doesn't get six  points she can go to a college in India instead of going to a university,l mean in that case will the University refund us
23/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that if a student does not manage to get 6 points, that does not mean they cannot pursue the intended program at the university please. 

If a student manages to get a minimum of 2 points in A-Level, they are still eligible for the same course. I hope this is clear?
