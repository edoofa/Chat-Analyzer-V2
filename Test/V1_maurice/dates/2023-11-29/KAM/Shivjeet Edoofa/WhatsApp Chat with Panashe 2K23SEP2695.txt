For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
07/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Im ready
07/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted

07/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Im done
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
07/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 390 2193: All clear
07/10/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/10/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
07/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Following
07/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 390 2193: All clear
07/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Well explained thank you

07/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 390 2193: We may begin
07/10/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
07/10/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

12/10/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/10/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/10/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/10/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 71 390 2193: We're on the same page
12/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 390 2193: I understood the Statement of Purpose whereby i get to state out my educational qualifications & outline the reason why i chose to a particular program stating why i should be considered legible to admitted.
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Rights refers to legal, social, ethical principles of freedom or entitlement , thus nominative rules about what is allowed to people by the constitution whereas duties are legal obligations. Our rights os what every human being deserves be it race, where you come from, where you live or your wealth status whilst duties is something that someone is expected to do. Human beings should not be deprived of their rights as they will lose their self esteem and it is our duty to protect human rights to make sure that they are upheld. Some of the human rights include right to education, right to food, right to shelter, right to speech, right to education and many more. Duties limit a person's freedom at times whilst rights give freedom to people. A right is an interest recognized and protected by the state whereas duty is an obligation created and imposed by the state.
12/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Human rights are rights one acquire by being alive for example right to shelter whilst civil rights are equal social opportunities under the law for example right to vote.
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope you have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Can we reschedule for 6 pm
12/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Goodnight, thank you!!

14/10/23, 12:24 am - +263 71 390 2193: 3. A Prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt whilst an Attorney represents a person who has been accused of crime and tries to maintain the client's innocence, thus  protecting the defendant against against charges of crime. A Prosecutor is a Lawyer who represents the government in a criminal case , thus protecting the public from wrongdoers whereas an Attorney represents the client's best interest at all stages of legal arraignment to sentencing helping the client to avoid incriminating himself and making sure that the client's constitutional rights are not violated. During proceedings the Attorney must present any mitigating circumstances like mental illness or insanity.An Attorney may operate in public or private sector . The prosecutor's role is to prove the defendant is guilty of crime the crime he has been charged with. On the contrary, the prosecutor uses his vast resources to prove that the defendant is guilty.
14/10/23, 1:15 am - +263 71 390 2193: 4. I am interested in studying Criminal Law. My desire to help the needy by being an outstanding representative in the Court of Law bringing justice to everyone, be it the poor or rich. Growing up, I always wanted to fight for the rights of humanity. The guilty must be put behind bars because they are wrongdoers as they bring harm to the society and the innocent must walk scott free as they are law abiding citizens hence they deserve freedom. I want to study Criminal Law so as to ensure public safety , uphold the law and ensure that both rights of both victims and offenders are protected within the system.A variety of careers within this field as it is broad not only limited to law enforcement, but also the court system, social work, psychology and many more. Criminal Law enhances critical thinking  and problem solving. I believe i owe the society through studying Criminal Law I can help in reducing crime as I get to understand the mindset of criminals , thus helping in proper allocation of resources to control crime.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?

14/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
14/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 390 2193: That is very true and accurate.
14/10/23, 9:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
14/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 390 2193: Yes I'm ready
14/10/23, 9:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/10/23, 9:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/10/23, 9:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/10/23, 9:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 390 2193: I do understand
14/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
14/10/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/10/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/10/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 390 2193: Yes,  my counselor did discuss withe me about the registration feee
14/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
14/10/23, 11:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 71 390 2193: We're on the same page
14/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship: <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
14/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
14/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
14/10/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
14/10/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
14/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
14/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

14/10/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cI am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
16/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
16/10/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:30 pm. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/10/23, 4:58 am - +263 71 390 2193: I understood
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - +960 797-2984: Hie good afternoon to you too,hope you’re well.

On behalf of Panashe and family will you be able to schedule the session for later hour like 18.30 or that will be too late for you.??
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can please let me know once you are available to proceed with the session>
17/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Greetings to you all!!
17/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are ready to proceed with the session? <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 355 8648: We're ready, we can proceed
17/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted.
17/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 390 2193: That's is great, i understood.
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 390 2193: It's all clear!!
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
17/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
17/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 390 2193: You can shed more light
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 390 2193: All clear!!!
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Sure, i understood
17/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Yes im clear with it, i already wrote my A level in 2022.
17/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As yes indeed, please ignore this, dear.
17/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 390 2193: It's all clear, I've no inquiries as to how the admission process unfolds.
18/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Greetings to you all, I'm sorry we couldn't finish the session yesterday as i was facing network challenges.
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 390 2193: I'm available, we can continue with our session.
18/10/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 390 2193: I'm looking forward to the next steps& receiving the Offer letter.
20/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 390 2193: Greetings to you all!!
20/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 390 2193: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya  and she has scheduled my session from 2pm -3pm.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

15/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Sure we can proceed with our discussion

2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 390 2193: 1.$350
2.Free of charge
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
15/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 390 2193: That's it !!
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 71 390 2193: This is the total cost of my education, annually?
15/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed that is correct. With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1350.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1350(tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1600.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Namel's annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Understood
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Panashe's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. This delay might have led to missing out on this opportunity. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
17/11/23, 1:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Panashe!

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
17/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 390 2193: I'm fine thanks how are you?
17/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Sorry for being unavailable, I've been facing problems with my internet connection lately
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. It is alright, I understand. May I know if you are now comfortable to proceed with the session?
17/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Sure, we can proceed
17/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 390 2193: All clear
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Noted
17/11/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
17/11/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 8:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Panashe!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 390 2193: I'm fine thanks how are you?
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking.
18/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 390 2193: We cannot manage to raise $1000 in a period of 15 days

It's clear that the financial aspect is a significant concern. We're genuinely invested in supporting you through this. With that said, may I know if you have made any backup plans for your higher education?

23/11/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your decision to continue your education locally due to current financial challenges. However, I do recall that back in October, when you enrolled under the Edoofa program, you were enthusiastic and eager to explore higher education abroad. It seems that this desire you had has been put aside. I understand the challenges regarding finances about the cost of education, but this have been discussed with your counselor about the cost of education, and it still falls within the projection mentioned by your counselor. Hence, I would like to know what was the main reason you wished to pursue higher education abroad in the first place?
24/11/23, 5:24 am - +263 71 390 2193: I wanted to get better employment opportunities after completion of my studies, but we can't afford.

24/11/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Panashe!

I hope you are doing well today. I wasn't able to respond to your message earlier this morning as it was past my available hours, and even now, I'm allocating some extra time for our conversation. Your aspirations for better employment opportunities after completing your studies abroad are entirely valid and commendable. It's understandable that financial constraints can significantly impact such plans. I want to inform you that since you are concerned about job opportunities, you've come to the right place by joining the Edoofa Scholarship program from the very beginning. I also want to emphasize that you do have opportunities available. When comparing these opportunities, I'd like to highlight that they will be greater than those in Zimbabwe which will give you more exposure, experience, skill set, and Demand. As your admission officer, I am more than happy to provide you with the details as we continue with the session so that you have a better understanding of this and that you have a conclusion on your thoughts. Please let me know if you are available to proceed with the session?

I hope this message finds you well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by today, 28th November 2023. However, it has been a few days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 390 2193: Greetings to you , we're very sorry for the late responses, it's unfortunate that i can't continue with the Edoofa scholarship program

28/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 355 8648: Good Afternoon I am so sorry we couldn't manage to pay the money because it was a lot of money and needed in 15days time
28/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for getting back to me, I really appreciate your update regarding this. I understand that you are facing challenges with the deadline of the fees and as your admission officer I am here to help you out and secure your higher education with your dream opportunity ase mentioned above here.
