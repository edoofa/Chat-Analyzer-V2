So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
06/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes, sir but am sorry sometimes I will be not able to catch up with the session because I will be attending my school lessons and studies

I would like both you and your parents to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.

06/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
06/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Step 3, counseling session on university admission
06/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
06/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 950 9347: I understood that I will receive offer letters from few universities and l have to choose one because practically it's not possible to study to many universities..
06/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 950 9347: not yet,,
06/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Brendon, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 950 9347: no,it isn't clear at all sir because long way back,my mom once asked Mr Austin about the registration fee and he said registration fee and enrollment fee are the same...
06/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Long story short he was just trying to say we already paid the registration fee by the time my mom paid the enrollment fee.. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 950 9347: [3/15, 10:08] Moms: Greetings Mr Austin may you help me to clarify on those fees Edoofa program fee, rounds of application fee and reg fee what's the difference
[3/15, 10:14] +91 92050 95612: Good Morning Mrs Muresherwa!
[3/15, 10:14] +91 92050 95612: The program fee is $750 which was reduced to $350 due to the economic constraints
[3/15, 10:14] +91 92050 95612: You have paid it
[3/15, 10:18] Moms: Ok thank you thought it needs to be paid again
[3/15, 10:28] +91 92050 95612: You are welcome, no please
The enrollment fee/program fee has been paid already
06/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that Mr. Austin did not mention that the Enrollment fee and the Registration fees are the same here in this chat.
06/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
06/09/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 950 9347: noted sir
06/09/23, 10:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 950 9347: thank you sir,,,same applies
07/09/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Good evening sir
07/09/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes am in,,
07/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
07/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
07/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 950 9347: No problem
07/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
07/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 950 9347: yes sir,it was addressed at the *Meet and Greet* Student  meeting that took place in  Bulawayo, early of June..
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
07/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
07/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
07/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Sir,l am done
07/09/23, 10:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Same to you,thank you sir
07/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Good night
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. How are you doing today?
08/09/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 950 9347: I'm doing great!
08/09/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 950 9347: and that end??
08/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is good here too, thank you for asking.
08/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 950 9347: You're welcome
08/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With continuation of our session. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
08/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
08/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
09/09/23, 10:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely afternoon. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
09/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 950 9347: no problem
09/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Good afternoon sir
09/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 950 9347: l'm sorry l wasn't available by that time
11/09/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Brendon. It is alright, how are you doing this lovely evening?
11/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Great!
11/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Ok
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir,but my question  is let's say l didn't manage to pay the remaining $300 by October 15,, what will be the way forward??
12/09/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Brendon.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time I was able to reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 950 9347: no problem, good afternoon sir I am in
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 950 9347: You may proceed
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 950 9347: What about this question??
12/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The given dates are tentative dates and for the actual deadline of the form, you will be well be mentioned in the offer letters and will be notified, and guided for the same. May I know if you are clear here?
12/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
12/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
12/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 950 9347: no problem
12/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Ok
12/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Good evening
12/09/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
12/09/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
12/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
12/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 950 9347: noted
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yessir
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Clear
12/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 950 9347: noted
12/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
13/09/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir

18/10/23, 12:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the opportunities that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
19/10/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*


When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in Feb 2023, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
25/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Brendon!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to receive a reply from you regarding the admission process for Brendon, and it seems that my previous message was left unattended.
25/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, as your admission officer, I am committed to ensuring you have a better future and affordable, and for that, I have some exciting news that I would like to share with you regarding some benefits that would drastically reduce your tuition fees. So please let me know if you are available so that I can share the details of these benefits with you to help alleviate your financial burden. And it is for a limited time, I don't want you to lose out on this opportunity as well.
25/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that being said, I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currenly available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 436 4881: Good afternoon Sir hope you are doing well thanks for contacting am present now Brendon is now on the midst  of his final examinations
25/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that, as this is also a family discussion group, we could also proceed with any of the family members as well. So, without further ado, shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 436 4881: You may proceed
25/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 436 4881: No queries
25/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Brendon's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Early Decision Benefit Program with the grant of $150, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Brendon is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
25/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 436 4881: Yes lam
25/10/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Brendon's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 436 4881: Thank you
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Brendon,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Brendon,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Hello Mr Shivjeet it's been long since we last spoke..
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 950 9347: How have you been sir
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 950 9347: I was going through the offer letter and l am ready to discuss about it..
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your kind words. I've been well, thank you. I hope you and your family are doing great too. I'm glad to hear that you've had the chance to go through the offer letter. Congratulations once again on this significant achievement.  As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 950 9347: would be thrilled to know
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 950 9347: l am copy with that sir
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 950 9347: 1.900USD
2.3years (6 semesters)
3.300USD
4.750USD
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Ok
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 950 9347: can you proceed
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Ok
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Clear
15/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 950 9347: yes
15/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
15/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 950 9347: no,,l live in Mutare
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Brendon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Yes sir
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

16/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. I would like to let you know that I am now ready and active to take on your session for the admission process.

So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.

20/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 950 9347: I live in Mutare...
20/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

20/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you happen make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Brendon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter.
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
25/11/23, 8:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Brendon!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So shall we proceed?
27/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Brendon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Brendon

I hope this message finds you well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by today, 28th November 2023. However, it has been a few days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
