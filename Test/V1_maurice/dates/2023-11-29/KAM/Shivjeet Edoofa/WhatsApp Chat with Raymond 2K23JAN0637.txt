19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?

19/10/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, may I know if you were able to give me a reply?
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 559 6271: I dont Understand very The 4th one but if l remember well it was said you will apply at many Universities and choose the best from applied Universities
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yes am following
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Am ready Mr Shivjeet
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Well understood l have read them
19/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 559 6271: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 559 6271: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 559 6271: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the documents.
19/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Understood
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Exciting
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 559 6271: It remains unchanged because of Edoofa??
19/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
19/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Pretty clear as l understand l paid the  $350  right if am not mistaken it was the registration?
19/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The was the enrollment fee for your edoofa program, May I know if you are clear?
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ohk
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Clear
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 559 6271: It’s Pretty Clear
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 559 6271: You can  expagorate more sir
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
19/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 559 6271: I understand now
19/10/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yea l read them very well
19/10/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Well understood
19/10/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 559 6271: So you mean if l dont do well in my A level and opt for option 2 l can still come?
19/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes you can you the diploma is for India as well.
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ohk
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yea you can share the costs sir
19/10/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We have discussed the estimated cost in our previous conversation, and I would like to let you know what the exact number will be mentioned in the offer letter. May I know if you are clear here?
19/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Am with you sir
19/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?  @263785596271

16/11/23, 6:05 am - +263 78 559 6271: Ok sure
16/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Raymond!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
17/11/23, 6:38 am - +263 78 559 6271: Sorry l wasn’t online for the session
17/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Raymond!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. It is alright,  I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
17/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Sure lets proceed
17/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 559 6271: 1.  900USD
2.  3 years 
3.  300USD
4.  750
17/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yea l understand
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. So, would you please let me know if we are still connected with this session so that we can conclude our session for the day? @263785596271
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Am sorry Mr Shivjeet we experiencing Electricity challenges here
17/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ok l understand on Accomodation there thank you
17/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Well understood ✅
17/11/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 559 6271: So this all is it included in that 1800USD or ????
17/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, it is not and I am coming to the breakdown very soon. Now, Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ohhk great
17/11/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 255 0515: Good day l have also been following the charts,, regarding the registration  l thought we where going to pay when Raymond get his A level results. Clarify more

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now happy to get your matters cleared now. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.

20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Raymond !

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that there may be circumstances that have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation.

Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, a timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents and to avoid getting revoked by the university so that you will not lose out on this opportunity. Hence, I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
20/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Afternoon Mr Shivjeet
20/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Good day l have also been following the charts,, regarding the registration  l thought we where going to pay when Raymond get his A level results. Clarify more
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I'd like to inform you that the universities have commenced the admission process early, and most of your peers have completed their admission process with the assistance of the A-level statement of entry. Additionally, it was discussed during our conversation about the admission process that this is one of the benefits being provided to you. Could you confirm if you recall the same?
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yea l do recall
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. If you are clear now shall we move on with the session?
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yes let’s continue
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Sure
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ohk l understand
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yea it’s clear sir
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 559 6271: No Binga
21/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Ohk so there is no other way other than meeting him??
What if am in Bulawayo?
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed there is an I am coming to that. If you happpen to make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
23/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 559 6271: Ok sure thank you
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Raymond!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session and let us conclude the offer letter today. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Am ready
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
25/11/23, 8:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear Parents and Raymond!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So shall we proceed?
27/11/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Raymond!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your availability so that we can complete the discussion?
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Hie good day sir
27/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: How are you doing tday?
27/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and have a meaningful converation. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. Please excuse me for the late arrival. How are you doing today?
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Am ok and how are you
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by today, 28th November 2023. However, it has been a few days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 559 6271: Yes just waiting for confirmation from parents
28/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you please provide an estimate of when you might receive confirmation for the offer? As tomorrow marks the deadline for your offer letter, and missing this deadline could result in losing out on the offer.
