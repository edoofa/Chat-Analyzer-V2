15/11/23, 10:15 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Clear!
15/11/23, 10:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for sharing all of these documents?
15/11/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour grows late on my end, I'm afraid I have limited time available today. Therefore, I regretfully must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow starting from 1:00 PM onwards to continue our discussion. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
15/11/23, 10:22 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: The place where we stay right now is far away from the school. So it's gonna be hard for us to get the letters and everything done at the mentioned time

18/11/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/11/23, 10:29 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Very well ready sir
18/11/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 10:41 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Am done
18/11/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/11/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/11/23, 10:53 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes sir very clear
18/11/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/11/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/11/23, 11:45 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Following
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Clear
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
18/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: On the registration fee of 500-1000$ how many weeks are we given to complete it?
18/11/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that ideally, the university gives a period of two weeks to make the payment of the fee, however, at present there are certain options in place with that you will be getting a time of around 30 days to 35 days to make the payment and we will discuss that moving ahead in our discussion. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 1:11 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Very well understood sir
18/11/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes we can
18/11/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/11/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/11/23, 1:24 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Am ready

20/11/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may you please share your understanding and experience of the videos with me here.
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Am so glad that the founders had to make important videos to clarify us/me:

Have understood that on the other hand EDOOFA is all about making students employable, responsible and independent so long as the students follow the instructions and be open minded. 
It's not only about getting quality and affordable education and making them employable but also increasing the student capacity for success

The founders spent alot of time like close to 10 year to identify good colleges or university for EDOOFIANS to roll in

And we are rest assured that the schools that works with EDOOFA offers quality education and that we shouldn't stress.

In the end I should be able to serve the community.

My experience was just great!
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: In the end I should be able to serve the community with the right attitude

24/11/23, 5:13 am - +265 993 65 25 42: 2. EXPLAIN ABOUT BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT (BPM) LIFE CIRCLE

Business process management is a systematic approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of business process within an organization to improve and achieve specific goals.
Business process management has a lifecycle and this circle contains five stages

      DESIGN.
This is the foundation stage of the BPM and it is all about looking at the state of the business and making an improved plan. It starts with finding out the goals that are to be achieved. The stage also involves redesigning of business strategies to meet up with the goals. The redesigning process includes business analyst, stakeholders, owners as well as the experts in redesigning.
24/11/23, 5:13 am - +265 993 65 25 42: MODEL.
After redesigning the process of the business in stage one it is time now model them. Modelling involves the process of finding out inputs and outputs of each nd every process that has been designed. Inputs are the things that goes into the process such as raw materials or information while outputs are those that comes out of the process for example the products (finished) and the services provided to the customers.

    EXECUTE.
Putting the business process into action is the third stage, before implementing it fully, testing it on a small scale is essential, this is to ensure that it works as planned.

    MONITOR.
for a business to monitor the process very well there is a need to introduce metrics and key performance indicators to track.

         OPTIMIZE.
This is the last stage whereby the business continuously keep on improving the process that have been analyzed, identified and documented, to make it more effective and streamlined.
24/11/23, 5:13 am - +265 993 65 25 42: 3. HOW DOES BUSINESS CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT? PLEASE ELABORATE AND STATE WITH EXAMPLE.

There are different ways on how the business contribute to the economic development;

 *The business raises the standard of living; this is done by setting industries and creating job wealth and new position, it improves the livelihood of people with the production of quality affordable products and services.

Economic independence; a business can also be a path to economic independence. For example if there is a company in the country which manufactures and produces goods e.g tobacco, can be exported in other countries this can lead to expansion, self reliance, currency inflow and economic independence.
24/11/23, 5:13 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Creating jobs; meeting up with the customers requirements or having them satisfied with the goods produced or services provided, can lead to the creation of new jobs, this is because there will be a competition in business, opening of other businesses and this might need people to be recruited and work there, because business encourages competition and innovation.

Economic growth; businesses drives economic growth, when one business is established it attracts competition, this means that slot of people will open the same business, which will lead to the growth of the economy, and when there is competition, improved products and services are provided to the society
24/11/23, 5:13 am - +265 993 65 25 42: 4. EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM  YOUR LIFE WHICH SHOWS YOUR MANAGERIAL TALENT/SKILL

25/11/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 11:43 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Greetings!

Yes we are ready
25/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/11/23, 12:50 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes it's accurate
25/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/11/23, 12:53 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes am ready
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 1:07 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
25/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/11/23, 2:35 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes
25/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/11/23, 3:11 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes
27/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Am doing great and how are you sir!
27/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes I am ready
27/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes we're
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes
27/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/11/23, 8:13 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
27/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me.
