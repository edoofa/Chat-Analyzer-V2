With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 8:23 am - +263 71 561 4711: Good morning sir
21/10/23, 8:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 561 4711: Okay we can proceed
21/10/23, 8:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
21/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 561 4711: We at the third step
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 9:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?

The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities.

21/10/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 561 4711: Yes Sir
21/10/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/10/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah l am ready
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 561 4711: Ok we can continue
21/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok sir
21/10/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes  it is clear
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 561 4711: I have a question?
21/10/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes please ask.
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon as it is the weekend. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Dylan!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 306 5925: I'm fine sir
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok, I have a question.
Is it possible to enrolled without A level results
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +46 73 697 27 31: Good evening. 
Yes I would like to ask about the payment 

I thought I understand may not well from the beginning. 
That if he takes his results when we know that he pass his exams then we will do the payment. 
Now my question is what is he did not come out with the results required to start at university what is going to happen. 
I am just asking because I have been following all the conversations
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - +46 73 697 27 31: What if he did not
26/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered.
26/10/23, 7:02 pm - +46 73 697 27 31: Dylan
27/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Dylan. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
27/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents with me.
14/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Dylan,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

15/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 561 4711: But my A level results are not yet out
15/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your greetings, and I'm doing well, thank you. I understand that you mentioned your A-level results are not yet out. No worries; it's not uncommon as the admission process has already started early.

Given the circumstances, we can still proceed with discussing the offer letter and the next steps while keeping your A-level results pending. It is done so with the help of the A-level Statement of Entry as we discussed before in our conversation with the admission process. So, with that said shall we move on with the session?
15/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok

15/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes it is clear
15/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK,what do you mean by"can go for accommodation  independently"
15/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Going for accommodation independently" means that as a student, you have the option to find and arrange your own accommodation outside of the university-approved accommodations. This gives you the flexibility to choose a place that suits your preferences and budget.

If you choose to go for accommodation independently, you would be responsible for finding a place to stay on your own. The cost mentioned, in this case, includes both accommodation and basic living expenses such as food. It's a more self-directed approach, allowing you to explore housing options beyond what the university directly provides. Which Of course, this will be well guided by the officials of Edoofa as well. May I know if you are clear on this?
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes it is clear
15/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Ok
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Okay
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes sir
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK sir ,l have a question
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure, please ask.
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 561 4711: If applied using my A results does it mean l would  get more percentages on my scholarship?
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is a great question. Yes, when the A-level results arrive and we would be uploading them to the university officials, after thorough evaluation, you have the chance to increase the scholarship percentage. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK l understand
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 561 4711: I stay in Harare
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Dylan!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
16/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Okay we can proceed
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK sir
16/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
16/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes thank you sir
16/11/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah l am following
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes and sure
16/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Thank you sir and l am sorry for late response caused by network problem
17/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me share some more glimpse of the university as well.

17/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
17/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK thank sir
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Wish you a blessed weekend.
17/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 561 4711: You too sir
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Dylan!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
20/11/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
20/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK
20/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to yes or no?
20/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Okay  they agree to do it but for now they said they will pay the registration fee next year after my results are out
20/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Thank you so much for your time during the session today.

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Thank you sir
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. May I know if yu are ready to proceed with the session?
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah l am ready
21/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me. So may I know if you are facing any challenges currently?
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Next week my little sister is getting enrolled in a secondary school
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great to hear about your sister's upcoming enrollment! It's such an exciting time for her and your family.

Regarding our discussion about your registration fee, I understand the importance your family places on waiting for your results before making the payment. However, delaying payment might result in the revocation of the offer letter, leading to the loss of both the offer and the Endowment Benefits you were entitled to, dear. And as your admission officer I do not wnt that to happen to you.
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 561 4711: No
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So I would like to ask may I know if you have made any plans for the same?
21/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Not yet
21/11/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case how are you planing to tackle this, dear.?
24/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Dylan!

I hope you are having a fine evening. Over the past few days I was hoping for a response from you end.

So for me to understand better let us schedule our session for tomorrow morning at 8:30 Am. I am committing this extra hours for you only so that you can secure you dream here in India. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
24/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Good evening to you sir
25/11/23, 8:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning!

I hope you are doing well today. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

25/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your sister's enrollment next Monday, it's great to have that date set. I hope she's excited about starting her educational journey.

Considering your higher education plans, I understand you might be navigating some challenges. Ensuring your readiness for this journey is crucial.  Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of 28th November. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
25/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 561 4711: Okay for now l don't know what my parents are planning
25/11/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's understandable. Planning can sometimes take unexpected turns. Whenever your parents finalize the arrangements or have a clearer idea, do let me know. The more prepared you are, the smoother the journey toward your aspirations will be. So, may I know by when they might be able to give me an update?
25/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 561 4711: OK l will inform you
25/11/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, may I know by when they might be able to give me an update?
25/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 561 4711: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Tomorrow
25/11/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear. I shall wait for the same. Have a nice day and my warm wishes to your family as  well.
25/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Thank you sir
25/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're welcome! If there's anything else I can assist you with in the meantime, feel free to let me know. Have a wonderful day ahead!
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Dylan!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Good evening sir
27/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 561 4711: For now my parents do not have the money to pay for my admission fee
27/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the update. May I know if your parents are facing any challenges?
27/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 561 4711: I don't know exactly but they said they will pay my admission fee next year
27/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
27/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
27/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in January or February next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
27/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted your child to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
27/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 561 4711: OK sir thank you
27/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 1:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. Please excuse me for the late arrival. How are you doing today?
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Good afternoon sir
28/11/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to ask if you were able to properly go through my above explanation?
28/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yes
28/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you pease share me your thoughts regarding this?
28/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah it is good
28/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential for you to retain this offer letter.

Therefore, I would like to reach out to you and understand the amount you have managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming date of November 30th. After this, the university will be closing the round of application for this month. This detailed information will enable us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
