*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

27/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 130 2927: 2..The difference between Rights and Duties is that,Rights refers to the legal,social,ethical principles of freedom, whereas Duties refers to an obligation to perform something.Rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people in other words what people are expected of for example,it is a citizen's right to justice,wherein duties are simply an expression of respect,a task or chore which a person is expected to perform ,a good example is that a girl child is expected to wash dishes.To further there are human rights and civil rights,the difference between human rights and civil rights is that Human rights are those we have simply because we exist as human beings while civil rights are a class of rights meant to protect individual's freedom.An example of human right is the right to freedom of movement,right to voice an opinion whereas civil rights protect individuals from infringement by government for example right to a fair trial and right to marriage equality
27/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 130 2927: 3.
The difference between a Prosecutor and an Attorney is that a prosecutor is a legal representative of the prosecution in states with the common law,whereas an attorney is a legally appointed individual responsible to transact business on another's behalf especially as a lawyer.A prosecutor works in the law adversarial system or civil law inquisitorial system,a prosecutor's job is bringing defandants in criminal cases to justice,while an attorney is empowered to act as an agent on behalf of someone.The prosecutor is responsible for starting legal proceedings in the name of the state, also leading investigations is an important duty of a prosecutor, while an attorney only represents someone although however an attorney is not only trained and educated in law but also practices it.Prosecutors decide the kind of inquiries the police should make while.leading an investigation for.example.during a murder case whereas an attorney will appear only as a representative for another.
27/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 130 2927: 4..
Civil law is the type of law  I am most interested in studying.It is a law which regulates non-criminal rights, duties of persons and eqaul legal relations.It also deals with the legislative system yet leaving room for judiciary to adjust rules towards social change and new needs.Civil law is said to have originated in Europe according to wikipedia.Moreso defamation is one example of a case dealt with by civil law.breach of contract and also negligence for example a child being neglected by their parents.The reason why I am interested in studying civil law is because it will enable me to play a role in conflict resolution as according to Karl Max a society is based on conflict hence I would like to put an end to society conflict.It also helps encourage cooperation between members of society ,thereby bringing unity amongst communities.Civil law helps in deterring exploitative behaviours amongst people thereby reducing the rate of crimes such as burglary assault to mention but a few.
27/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 130 2927: 5..
Being a lawyer requires a set of skills and I believe that i  have the right skills for example being empathetic towards others is one of my skills for example seeing an individual who is unable to stand up for themselves I always feel obliged to help them.I am an open-minded individual who is ready to tackle any problems easily and progressively and if the situation requires can be a critical thinker,this skill will help me become a successful lawyer.Along with these skills I am also a hard worker who is capable of working under pressure and this trait qualifies me to be a successful lawyer.I am a sociable ndividual who believes in team work and work very well with others withing a given space,last but not least I am very good with time management,can perform any given task within an arranged or agreed time frameAs all these skills are important in becoming a successful lawyer I believe I am the right candidate.

27/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

I am happy to notice that you have managed to fill out the SOP form and answer the questions. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes sir I am ready.sorry for the late reply
27/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Moving forward. please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*2. O-Level Results*

27/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Ooook sir
27/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when you might be able to share it with me?
27/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 130 2927: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 130 2927: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 130 2927: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 130 2927: The information is correct thank you sir..I would like to apologize for my late replies as I am facing some network setbacks.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear. I can understand the same.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes I am ready
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 130 2927: I agree with you sir.it is indeed not possible
27/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Very well noted sir
27/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Indeed my counselor discussed this concept with me
27/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes sir I am with you
27/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Indeed I have sir
27/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
27/10/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400  will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 130 2927: I am following sir
27/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 130 2927: I have understood this aspect sir thank you
27/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Oook sir I understand
27/10/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/10/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 130 2927: I do not have any queries unfortunately my Mother is not available at the moment to join our session but I personally do.not have any queries
28/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 77 130 2927: Good morning Mr Shivjeet.I have a sister  who came to India in (2022) last year through the Edoofa Scholarship Programme and she is currently learning at Galgotias University.I would be very glad if I were to also get an Offer Letter from that same University.
28/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Greetings Mr Shivjeet , i have gone through the discussions you made prior, and i am glad with the progressions. Thank you
30/10/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes indeed sir and that would be wonderful
30/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/10/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes sir it is quite clear
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 130 2927: I am indeed following followed
30/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Noted with thanks
30/10/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 352 8778: No Sir.
30/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Flora's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Flora is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes we are
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes sir I am looking forward to the next step
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.

15/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

15/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes i went through the letter,

5.The admission and processimg fee to be paid to  secure a Scholarship seat is $1000
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details Mr. NAME. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Thats so incredible, im so GRATEFUL for my daughter 's offer letter from MVN Unirvesity
15/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Absolutely, education becomes more affordable
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250 <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1350.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1350 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1600.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Namel's annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Really, thats great news
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Very well Noted sir
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Flora's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Woow
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Have gone through it
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 130 2927: That is indeed wonderful and helpful
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 130 2927: It indeed clarifies a lot on the Scholarship credits
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Thats great
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Thats wonderful
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival in India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Absolutely
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Im really greatfull that the Scholarship, is there to ease the financial burden from us parents, making the education affordable for my daughter
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Flora through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 352 8778: 28 november is the due date,
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$425 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$425 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 352 8778: This Will be a flexible payment plan
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Noted with thanks
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Is it possible, for someone who is in India to make the payment in Cash , or to deposit the money into the MVN Unirvesity account
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Also ,is flora going to receive other offer letters from other Universities or its only MVN Unirvesity,
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Have a blessed day as well Mr Shivjeet
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Goodnight
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Flora!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 130 2927: We can proceed
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 130 2927: How are you MrShivjeet
16/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking, dear. I am happy to hear that you are now ready to proceed with the session. I would like please know if you are facing any challenges with the payment made from your home town?
16/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Greetings Sir Shivjeet, yes we can proceed
16/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you are now ready to proceed with the session also before that would please let me know if you were able to go through my above message?
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Yes sir I was able to go through the message
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for your reply with the same.
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Actually my mom is currently not available ,however on her behalf I would like to say she made the suggestion due to the transfer charges to be incared while transferring the money from my home town
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Im trying to run away from  the 7% charge,
16/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Netwk is acting up where i am
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, that is a great approach. However, universities receive a transaction of a huge amount of students daily, and it will be challenging for them to track and update your payment on short notice, which may lead to a delay in updating the details on the university's end. In light of this, I would like to let you know that you can indeed make the payment once you have arrived in India, and from there, you can pay the universities directly and physically. This will help you solve the charges problem, and since you are there, they will be able to update the details instantly too. May I know if you are clear here?
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes Sir, Will contact Me Rajan then, Thank you
16/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Noted with thanks, Will definately make the payment as soon as the funds avail.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 352 8778: ,is flora going to receive other offer letters from other Universities or its only MVN Unirvesity,?
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Also is there an option for her staying out of campus
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?"
16/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: And to this question yes you can but that comes under the cost of sacrificing your free accommodation for the university.
16/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Noted
16/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Yes its clear
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 352 8778: Noted , so staying on the campus Will be ideal

23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Flora !

I hope you are having a fine afternoon. Our DSW (Department of Student Welfare) Team recently had a trip to MVN University this week. During their visit, they had a good time interacting with the students and managed to capture glimpses of your senior colleagues who have enrolled at MVN University this year for the 2023 intake. I wanted to share this information with you to let you know that they had a great time with the DSW team.

In case you're curious about the person in the photo from our team, that is Mr. Mukund. He will be one of the individuals greeting you upon your arrival in India.

I would like to let you know that I was not able to connect to you earlier as it was past my available hours. Now coming to your concern, Surely, I can help you with the two invoices, however, I am not sure if that would help you out since you have a limit of $250. If you are able to make the payment of the first invoice, you will face a challenge with the second part since the limit has not been lifted by PayPal. To help you with this, could you please let me know the status of your verification?

Have you been able to log in to your account, add your card details, and verify the same with PayPal? If not, may I know what is the challenge you are facing in getting the same done?
28/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, if you find that the challenges with Paypal persist and you're unable to verify your account, you can opt to make the payment through your Visa/Mastercard by visiting the Edoofa website. I am providing you with the link to the website [https://www.edoofa.com/]. 

To proceed, simply visit the website and scroll to the bottom of the page, where you'll find the "Pay Now" button. Clicking on this button will ask you to fill in your card details and proceed with the payment. I have also attached screenshots for your reference.
