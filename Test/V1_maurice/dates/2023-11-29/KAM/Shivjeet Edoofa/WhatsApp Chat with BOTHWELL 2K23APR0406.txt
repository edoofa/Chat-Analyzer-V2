Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
16/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Counseling session on University Admission
16/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
16/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 650 4403: I think you as Edoofa will link me to many universities and then offer me with a wide variety whereby l choose the university that l want to go
16/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
16/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
16/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
16/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes please
16/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
16/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Ok
16/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
16/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Ok
16/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
16/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 650 4403: I have a question
16/10/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:30 pm. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Okay
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Okay
17/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 650 4403: No queries
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Okay thank you
14/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Bothwell

15/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.

15/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 650 4403: 1.$1165
2.3 years

4.$750
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I will be closing our session for now due to unexpected work that just came up.

So please do excuse me for that and, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Thank you
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and BOTHWELL!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes please
16/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1165, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2415. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2165 ($1165 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Okay
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Yemurai with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2415. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2415- $1000 = $1415, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. I would like to let you know that I am now ready and active to take on your session for the admission process.

I would like you to give your full participation and concentration during these few hours that are required to complete and conclude our session for the day without any delay that may lead to the rescheduling of the session and the delay of this letter. So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes I'm ready
17/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1165 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665. This amount can be paid in two installments of $832 and $833, spaced 6 months apart.
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 28th, 2023.
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
17/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes please
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. So, would you please let me know if we are still connected with this session so that we can conclude our session for the day?@263776504403
17/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/11/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 650 4403: We live in Masvingo
17/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Ok thank you
17/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes please
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Thank you

17/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yea
17/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 650 4403: Yes
17/11/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.

21/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
21/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 650 4403: For now I'm cannot say l have the specific date to pay the money because l am still insearch of money
21/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
21/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.

27/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Bothwell!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 650 4403: As of now all l can say is that as a family we are financially unstable But as you said that the dead line is tomorrow we will try to find something before noon tomorrow but for now there is no money
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for updating me on your current situation. I understand the challenges you're facing, especially concerning the upcoming deadline for the first part of the university registration fees.

Your determination to find a solution amidst financial instability is commendable. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of 28th November. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
27/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 650 4403: For now there is nothing
27/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As I would like you to retain this letter, may I know if you might be able to gather an amount of $100 by tomorrow?
28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bothwell. 

I hope you are doing well. With regards to our conversation that we had yesterday, I wanted to reach out to you to get an update on the discussion you had as a family regarding your scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University and your university admission formalities for the same. As we discussed yesterday, you were trying to fund some amount of money towards your fee so that you can secure your scholarship seat before the due date of today, 28th November 2023.
28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?

28/11/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply. I was having a long meeting with the university officials and tomorrow as well.
28/11/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the financial challenges that you are facing right now.
28/11/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the circumstances, I am your admission officer and I am here to help you out on this to help secure Bothwell's offer letter. Hence I shall be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and in that, I shall be addressing this concern. With that I would like to know how much were you able to gather that can be paid before the end of this month that is 30th of November. The reason I am saying this is that after this month the university will be closing the round of application and I am afraid I will not be able to help you out after this date. So could you please provide me with the least amount gathered by now?
