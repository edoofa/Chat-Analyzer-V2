20/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
20/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Do you mean a brief understanding on all the stages
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct the steps that we have covered already,

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Thank you enjoy your evening as well
21/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Good afternoon message from the founders carried 4 videos. 
Video 1 talks about two important qualities of a successful Edoofian which are following instructions, being open minded and teachable.

Video 3 goes on to talk about Universities under Edooda's decade long journey of identifying the right accredited Universities.

21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Goodafternoon to you. I am in a meeting not sure if I will be able to join you today. If there are any tasks you can send them through I will look at them In the evening
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I'm still to complete what I remember from the counselling section
21/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 904 0377: The counselling process was about the registration fee as well as offer letters from the University. It also enlightened me about the difference in fees structure of each University. There is an admission fee that is supposed to be paid once one gets an offer letter so that the University reserves a place. Accommodation fees were also highlighted. The fees would depend on the percentage of scholarship one gets. Thank you
21/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that that is absolutely correct. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 904 0377: We are on the same page, unfortunately sir I am held up in a meeting which might end after 5pm. I will not be able to respond as I am taking the minutes. Sorry I thought the meeting would end before 3pm
21/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

25/09/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

25/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Okay well noted
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes I'm clear on that
25/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 904 0377: This is well understood and well appreciated for considering us
25/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 904 0377: In this economic situation it is hard to come by money especially a lot of it
25/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it does
25/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Im now travelling home can we continue tomorrow
25/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can proceed with the session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Hazel!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Goodafternoon I am in a meeting right now will let you.know when I finish
26/09/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall wait for the same.
26/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Goodevening I'm so sorry I failed to attend today's session
26/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright we can further proceed with the session tomorrow.
26/09/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Thank you for understanding me
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes I'm ready
27/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 904 0377: This is noted with many thanks and greatly appreciated
27/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I am following
27/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 904 0377: May you provide me with more information
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Kindly
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it's now very clear thank you for clarifying that point. Will encourage her to work hard to.attain good grades
27/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I am grateful thank you
27/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes that's what we know
27/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/09/23, 6:16 am - +263 77 904 0377: I believe she will excel but if she decides to pursue a diploma will she still be an Edoofian?
28/09/23, 6:16 am - +263 77 904 0377: Will the scholarship  still stand
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Good afternoon thank you so much for letting me know. Have a good day and your family
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

Sending you my best wishes for a swift and complete recovery. Take care.

Please prioritize your recovery and take the necessary time for rest and treatment. Whenever you feel up to it, we can reschedule our session at your convenience.

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to receive a reply from you regarding the admission process for Hazel, and it seems that my previous message was left unattended. <This message was edited>

However, as your admission officer, I am committed to ensuring you have a better future and affordable. So please let me know if you are available so that I can share the details of these benefits with you to help alleviate your financial burden.

26/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. Sory for the late reply. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Hello we can begin
26/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I am clear on that
26/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I am clear on that thanks
26/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Im getting the options available.for.Hazel,  if.her points are satisfactory she will proceed to Bsc straight
26/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 904 0377: May i know how much is the registratiom fees?
26/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, is a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
26/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 904 0377: We are on the same page
26/10/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Hazel's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Hazel is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
26/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected? @263779040377
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 904 0377: We are on the same page.

26/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Hazel's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
05/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Hello i hope you and your family are well.

15/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 904 0377: The other issue is that of the registration fees i saw that we are only given 15 days to settle.the $1000,  it is such a short period and can it be extended please. We really cannot miss this opportunity

15/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it does and it is well appreciated
15/11/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

15/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it is well clarified and umderstood
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up.

15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how Hazel can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 904 0377: It is well understood we can continue
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Hazel's total annual education cost as $2500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it is clear
15/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Okay im following,  so if the student earns those points will that be communicated to the parents/guardians
15/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, If a student successfully earns scholarship credits through the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program, the information will be communicated to both the student and the parents/guardians. Regular updates on the earned credits, as well as any adjustments made to the student's account, will be shared with the relevant parties.
15/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Okay noted with thanks
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Okay that is well understood
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Hazel's is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $1000 annually (meaning that your overall cost of education has now come sown to $2250 per annum from the one that we projected before that is $2700 to $3700), even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Well understood and appreciated as you look for high quality universities on.our behalf
15/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I agree totally with you
15/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Hazel through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes indeed
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Please go ahead
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$425 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$425 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $800 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes it is now clear to me,  i have understood. Thank you so much for the time and patience in explaining everything to me
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Be blessed
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 904 0377: We are happy and do not know how to express our gratitude
15/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're very welcome! I'm delighted to hear that the information is clear, and I appreciate your kind words. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes we reside in Harare
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Noted with thanks will contact him
15/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes please do provide
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Thank you
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828

16/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

I hope you are having a fine afternoon. Our DSW (Department of Student Welfare) Team recently had a trip to MVN University this week. During their visit, they had a good time interacting with the students and managed to capture glimpses of your senior colleagues who have enrolled at MVN University this year for the 2023 intake. I wanted to share this information with you to let you know that they had a great time with the DSW team.

In case you're curious about the person in the photo from our team, that is Mr. Mukund. He will be one of the individuals greeting you upon your arrival in India.
