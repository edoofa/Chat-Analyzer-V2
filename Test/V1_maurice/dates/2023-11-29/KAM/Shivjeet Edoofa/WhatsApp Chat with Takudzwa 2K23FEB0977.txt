I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
13/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
13/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
13/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
13/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 588 9398: I understand that after  the offer letters, I will choose the university and I  am supposed to pay $750 to secure my place at that particular university
13/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
13/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
13/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
13/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
13/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
13/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes  Ma'am
13/10/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the benefits?
13/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes
13/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 588 9398: That is great Ma'am
13/10/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM. Have a great day ahead!
13/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 588 9398: Thank you Ma'am
14/10/23, 7:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Dear parents and Takudzwa. 

How are you doing this lovely weekend?
14/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 588 9398: Good Morning Ma'am
14/10/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready and available shall we proceed with the session?
14/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
14/10/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
14/10/23, 10:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 10:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
14/10/23, 10:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 10:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 10:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 588 9398: No Ma'am, I am following attentively
14/10/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
14/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes indeed Ma'am
14/10/23, 11:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Ma'am
14/10/23, 11:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 11:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
14/10/23, 11:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 11:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 588 9398: Yes Madam
14/10/23, 11:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.
