26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear. I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure.
26/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir l do remember some of the information
26/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 400 8155: We are excited and overjoyed to know that sir .. thank you
26/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir we are on the same page

Mind my network it's tripping
26/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 400 8155: We also thank you for taking and helping us up to this far.
We appreciate the hard work and help that you showed us.

26/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 400 8155: I'm all ready sir...you may proceed
26/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Noted
26/09/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay...well understood
26/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Following
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir
26/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir....l understand
26/09/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Noted
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes it does sir
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Thank you
Same to you
27/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
27/09/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay okay well understood
27/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes well noted
27/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 400 8155: May you provide more information please
27/09/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Good afternoon to you too
Yes am available
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
03/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes you are right <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yess l do agree
I go with option 2
03/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
04/10/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Deserve . 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/10/23, 5:40 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yes am clear sir
05/10/23, 5:40 am - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning sir .... today we are available for the session
Sorry for the late responses my network has been tripping earlier
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Afternoon to you too
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 400 8155: We are all fine and ready for the session
05/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now with further continuation. 

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay understood
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes thank you sir
05/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Good afternoon sir...how are you
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Good afternoon sir....we all had a great time during the weekend
We are ready to resume
09/10/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 400 8155: No sir.....l have no querie
09/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 400 8155: That's great news then...lm looking forward to be one of those students.Yes am looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

15/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 400 8155: 4.$750
15/10/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir well understood
15/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 400 8155: I would like to know how and when the campus accomodations is payed?
15/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Sir after the registration payment fee of $750usd + Admission and procedure fee of $300usd are done....Do we have to pay again for the first semester?
15/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 400 8155: How do we pay for the admission and procedure fee sir??in which is to be paid in 15 days
16/10/23, 7:40 am - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning sir
How are you?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Deserve!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding all the queries that you have shared, stay assured that we will discuss them moving ahead during our conversation. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 400 8155: We are doing well
16/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yes we are clear on this
16/10/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yes we are together
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes well understood
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir we are on the same page
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 400 8155: We stay in Gweru
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay sir thank you
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 400 8155: So I will just give him the money then he will do the rest right?
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, once paid, he will give you an official receipt as well please.
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay then...thank you
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir you may go ahead and share with me
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay sir so the amount will still be $750 or there will be an interest?
16/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, there isn't any interest, only the international transfer charges as I mentioned. Also, the amount is not $750, I have mentioned the same here please.
16/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Oh it skipped my mind....am sorry my bad it's $600
Thank you
16/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay sir
16/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Evening sir....since you mentioned about choice of universities can we wait for the other universities to give us feedback so that that we will be able to select the university of our own preference
17/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Deserve!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Now, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
17/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Afternoon sir
We are all fine
17/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes we are clear on that
17/10/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes we are all clear
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes am aware of that sir
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since you are already aware of what the transfer option is and how it helps you in working with multiple offer letters, then in that case, I believe that the best way to move ahead would be to secure the scholarship seat at Galgotias and then transferring your seat to another university when the other offer letter arrives based on your preference, right?
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
18/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Deserve!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion, may I know by when can we reconnect to proceed with the same?
19/10/23, 7:09 am - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning sir
We are all doing fine
19/10/23, 7:09 am - +263 71 400 8155: We can proceed today sir
19/10/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Deserve!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes we will be available sir
19/10/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Deserve!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Evening sir...we may proceed
19/10/23, 8:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Yes please
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we proceed, I believe you are clear till here as well, right?
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Yes.
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 655 5771: That's great news
19/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Yes sir...we are clear on that
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 655 5771: Yes...sure
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Yes sir we may proceed.... l'm sorry for the late reply am facing challenges with my network
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 655 5771: No queries yet sir
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 400 8155: I can obviously tell that the students are enjoying the place and are getting quality education
19/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 400 8155: This is really great
19/10/23, 11:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 11:19 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Okay sir thank you so much...we will do so
19/10/23, 11:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a blessed night!
19/10/23, 11:20 pm - +263 71 400 8155: Same to you

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
