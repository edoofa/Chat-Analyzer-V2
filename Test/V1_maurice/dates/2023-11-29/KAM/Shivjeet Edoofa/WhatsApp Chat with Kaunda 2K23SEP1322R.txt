Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
03/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Kaunda EWYL23E0753)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake.

04/10/23, 9:01 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay done.
04/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/10/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes sir
04/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/10/23, 9:33 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes
04/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 8:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:46 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay 
Have a blessed night.
05/10/23, 8:42 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good evening

05/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/10/23, 9:02 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes very clear
05/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

Help the students settle in well so that they are focused on what they have to do while at Edoofa. And that the students should be open-minded as well. 

2 EDOOFA’S VISION FOR YOU 

The vision for Edoofa is not just to have students and make them employable but it is also focused on increasing student capacity for success as a result making students more responsible and independent.

3 SCHOOLS,COLLEGES,AND UNIVERSITIES UNDER THE EDOOFA PROGRAM 

It talks about how Edoofa has invested so much time in identifying good schools,colleges and universities for passionate Edoofains. And the founders also encourage students to follow the instructions as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions. 

4 SOP

It talks about qualifications,scholarships and admissions. So this document should not only include the goals of the student,but also the students vision and why the student has chosen to study that particular course and why they have chosen that university.
06/10/23, 6:49 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good evening 
So sorry for connecting late,I had a busy day.
06/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Kaunda. 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect at our scheduled time. May I know if you are currently available to further proceed with the session?
06/10/23, 8:26 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes I’m available.
06/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/10/23, 8:34 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes we are.
06/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/10/23, 8:51 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay
06/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 12:00 PM.
06/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

10/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am hay to hear that. May I know if you might be able to share the O Level in the meantime?
10/10/23, 6:50 pm - +260 97 7453492: Sorry right I am unable to share that because Kaunda still has 3 subjects that he will be writing this November.Last year he wrote 4 subjects of which he cleared and so he was remaining with 3 subjects this year.
10/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update regarding Kaunda's O Level exams. Since he still has three subjects to write this November, we will await the results of those exams before proceeding with sharing his O Level results. Please keep us posted on the progress, and when you have the results, feel free to share them with us.
10/10/23, 8:16 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay

25/10/23, 4:48 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon sir.
25/10/23, 4:50 pm - +260 97 7453492: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:51 pm - +260 97 7453492: I don’t know if this is enough.
25/10/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if Kaunda might be able to fetch the Letter of Recommendation from the school with the subject included in the letter for which he will be appearing for this Grade 12 exam?
25/10/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 5:04 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay I will talk to the school administrator
25/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As we wait for the documents, shall we further proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 5:10 pm - +260 97 7453492: Can we connect at 7:30pm? I’m in the middle of something now and I will only be free that time.
25/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can.
25/10/23, 7:23 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good evening
25/10/23, 7:25 pm - +260 97 7453492: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 7:53 pm - +260 97 7453492: I’m doing well thanks and how are you?
25/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 8:12 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes I’am ready
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for stating the tweet of interest. May I know if you might be able to share the O level results with me?
25/10/23, 8:28 pm - +260 97 7453492: When you ask for O levels results what do you mean? Because Kaunda has been learning Cambridge since he went to secondary. So from year 8-12.
25/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. Just to clarify, I am referring to grade 9 in the Zambian education system. May I know if you are clear on this point?
25/10/23, 8:41 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes I’am clear,but Kaunda never learned the ECZ(Examination Council of Zambia) in secondary. He only did it from grade 1 to grade 7 and after that we took him to a Cambridge school.
25/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand. In that case, may I know if you might be able to share with me the Grade 10 results for the Cambridge school?
25/10/23, 8:45 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay I will pass through his former school next week and get the results.
25/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 8:51 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes we can.
25/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Fine Arts) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 8:57 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes it’s correct.
25/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. Grade 12 Result/Letter of Recommendation.*

*2. Grade 9 Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
25/10/23, 9:03 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay so can I share these documents when I collect all of them. Because right now the only documents available is number 3.
25/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, we understand that you may need some time to collect the necessary documents. Feel free to share them with us when they become available. In the meantime, focus on gathering these documents, and if you have any questions or need any assistance along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout the process.
25/10/23, 9:10 pm - +260 97 7453492: Thank you
25/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes
25/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 9:21 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes
25/10/23, 9:22 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay it’s clear.
25/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 9:27 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes he did.
25/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 9:33 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes we are.
25/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/10/23, 9:35 pm - +260 97 7453492: I have,thank you
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
25/10/23, 9:45 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted.
25/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 9:54 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay noted
25/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 9:57 pm - +260 97 7453492: No everything is clear.
25/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon.

I will be concluding our session for the day and look forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow, starting from 3:00 PM. Additionally, I will also be available in the evening from 7:30 PM onward. In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful evening, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/10/23, 10:08 pm - +260 97 7453492: Thank you sir and have a blessed night.
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon, I’m doing well thank and how’s been your day?
26/10/23, 4:16 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes I’am ready
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 4:22 pm - +260 97 7453492: Beautiful
26/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/10/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted. Yes I’am ready
26/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/10/23, 5:16 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay 
Well noted
26/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 5:38 pm - +260 97 7453492: Noted.
26/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 5:47 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes it does
26/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 6:33 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay noted
26/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 6:41 pm - +260 97 7453492: It’s clear thank you
26/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 6:42 pm - +260 97 7453492: Kindly give me more information.
26/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/10/23, 6:50 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay,well noted and it’s clear.
26/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 7:16 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes
26/10/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 7:37 pm - +260 97 7453492: It’s clear
26/10/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 8:03 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 8:17 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted
26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 8:35 pm - +260 97 7453492: It’s clear but I would also like my husband to go through the chats when he comes home for the weekend. Maybe he would have some queries.
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds like a good plan, having your husband review the information. If he has any questions or would like to discuss anything further, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to assist and clarify any doubts or concerns. Feel free to ask any questions that come up, and I'll be happy to provide the necessary information.
26/10/23, 8:41 pm - +260 97 7453492: Thank you
31/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parent and Kaunda.
31/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the process and have a clear understanding of the same?
06/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kaunda!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed which has led us to a delay in your admission process. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon,so sorry I wasn’t feeling well so that’s why there was no response.
06/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear that you weren't feeling well, and I completely understand if that affected your ability to respond. Your health is the top priority, and I hope you're feeling better now. May I know by when you might be able to proceed with the session?
06/11/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 7453492: Can we please connect tomorrow same time?
06/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, I understand, and your health comes first. We can certainly connect tomorrow at the same time.  Wishing you a restful evening, and I'll be in touch with you tomorrow at this time. Take care!
06/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 7453492: Thank you
07/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon,
I’am fine thank you and how are you?  Yes I’am free now.
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
07/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes I do
07/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7453492: It’s clear thank you
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Kaunda's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Kaunda is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
07/11/23, 2:36 pm - +260 97 7453492: Yes we are looking forward to receiving this offer.
07/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Kaunda's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
07/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/11/23, 3:57 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay thank you,well noted.
28/11/23, 8:56 am - +260 97 7453492: Good morning Sir
28/11/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 7453492: I’am just trying to follow up on this.
28/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parent and my dear student!

Thank you for the update. I wanted to inform you that the university is still in the process of reviewing your admission. As soon as we receive information about your offer letter, we will promptly share it with you.
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 97 7453492: Thank you,well noted.
