13/09/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Quite correct
13/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ye it's accurate
13/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

13/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I sent already
13/09/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the clerical error. Yes, Indeed you have shared the same.
13/09/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
13/09/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes I recall
13/09/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
13/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 815 3991: I think my information will be send to various universities and I will get to choose which university fits my choice
13/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 815 3991: You mean the Earn While You Learn Program
13/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No it is not and we will come to that next, dear.
13/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
13/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yeah a great relief
13/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 707 5754: This is really good news,
13/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 815 3991: No
13/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 815 3991: I'm done
13/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
13/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes very clear
13/09/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/09/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/09/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
13/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 17, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 17, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 17, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 815 3991: No I'm following
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/09/23, 7:35 am - +263 77 815 3991: Please provide more information
14/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Rufaro. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 815 3991: I'm doing well hwu
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I ma great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session now?
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
14/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
14/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
14/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ok I understand
14/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
17/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 815 3991: Yes I understand
18/09/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rufaro. Thank you for being patient with us. How are you doing today?
18/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 815 3991: I'm okay how are you
18/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I am good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes now I'm available
18/09/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
18/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes I agree
18/09/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/09/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes I'm clear
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yea
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes I'm clear
18/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ok understood
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 815 3991: That's alright
19/09/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Rufaro,

19/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Wow this is nice

20/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 815 3991: I'm doing fine hwu
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

16/10/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Could you please let me know if you are facing any challenges?
16/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Am occupied at my work place, usually I don't get enough time to go through discussion
16/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I am going the previous chats, admission requires one to get at least 2 A level points, if not one is given a chance to reappear for A level, or study and obtain  a diploma
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
16/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 707 5754: May we proceed
16/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Rufaro's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Rufaro is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
16/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I am looking forward to that,
16/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.

30/10/23, 2:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
02/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
02/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
02/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 08:00 PM to 10:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
02/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 3:34 am - +263 71 707 5754: Thank u sir, I am grateful for  the opportunity presented to my daughter, am really grateful
03/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Rufaro,

You're very welcome, and I'm delighted to hear your appreciation. We are equally excited about this opportunity for your daughter, and I'm here to support you throughout the admission process. Again, In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today regarding the discussion of the offer letter.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 707 5754: Yes, we clear here
04/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 707 5754: Where does the EWL programme come in
04/11/23, 10:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed I will come to that really soon with the details.  Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
04/11/23, 10:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
04/11/23, 10:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
04/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 707 5754: I understand. The best option will be the on campus accommodation
04/11/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great to hear that you prefer on-campus accommodation. It's a convenient option, especially for international students, as it provides a supportive environment and easy access to campus facilities. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
04/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 707 5754: Very well
04/11/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
04/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 707 5754: Yes that is very clear
04/11/23, 11:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
04/11/23, 11:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
04/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 707 5754: Yes, and am already running around to raise the money
04/11/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your dedication and prompt response. It's great to hear that you're taking the necessary steps to secure your scholarship seat.  In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
04/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are still connected with us and available for this session so that we can proceed with the session and hopefully complete our discussion in due time. @263717075754
04/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 526 8732: How are you sir
04/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Is it possible  to want more university options
04/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is possible. As of now, Rufaro's application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this? <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

04/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 526 8732: So does this mean I can still wait for other offer letters
06/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Rufaro!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 526 8732: How are you sir
06/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Still waiting for your response sir
06/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
06/11/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yes very clear thank you
06/11/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as itt is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 526 8732: You also said the registration fee can be paid in installments can u elaborate further
06/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Ok sir thank you for your time
07/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 526 8732: How are you sir
07/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, I am well thank you for asking. How is your family doing today?
07/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263715268732 

May I know if we are still connected with our session so that we can proceed with the same and hopefully complete the discussion to avoid any delays regarding the offer letter, which could potentially lead us to lose out on this opportunity?
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Rufaro!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed this hed led us to a delay in our session with the offer letter. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
08/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I noticed that we faced some challenges in maintaining a smooth discussion. I understand that there may have been some difficulties, and as your admission officer, I want to ensure we find the best solution.

To facilitate a more productive and efficient discussion regarding the letter, I would like to inquire about your availability for our session. This will allow us to complete our conversation in a timely and effective manner and avoid potential delay on the offer letter which may get revoked by the university. @263778153991 @263715268732
09/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 526 8732: It's alright
09/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 526 8732: How are you today
09/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Sorry sir having some networking challenges
09/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 526 8732: I will be available for the sessions today
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your willingness to reschedule our session for today.

I am available now, and we can continue our discussion on the offer letter at your earliest convenience. Please let me know when you would like to proceed. <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Can we do it now
09/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with further continuation. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yes I am now clear sir
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 526 8732: No Rusape
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 526 8732: OK thank you so j just give him the cash and hel do the rest for me or...
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 526 8732: And he will..
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
09/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
09/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 526 8732: What do you mean by  7% transfere rate
09/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The 7% transfer rate that I am referring to is the percentage of the total amount that Mr. Rajan will charge in transferring the payment to the university on behalf of the student. This is a relatively low fee when compared to other international payment methods, such as bank transfers or money transfer services, which typically charge 10-15% fees.
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are on the same page here?
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yeah  we are
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If Charles' is a more convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do let me know if you have received the details.
09/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yes thank you
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
09/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 526 8732: OK sir but I guess I will do on campus accommodation
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed you can too and you have a vast amount of time to decide, I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
09/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 526 8732: But I'm having problems in getting funds from the EWYL here in Zimbabwd
09/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know what problems are you facing?
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 526 8732: I can't reach a number of audience
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's alright. Thank you for sharing your problem with me. To help you better, I suggest sharing the same with your EWYL mentor. They will guide you in the best possible way, as they are committed to providing guidance throughout your career. May I know if you are clear on this?
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yes I'm clear
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Yes
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 526 8732: No queries sir
09/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

09/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

09/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
09/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 14th of November at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 526 8732: OK sir that's good
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 526 8732: So see you on the 14th of November
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 526 8732: Thank you sir
14/11/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Rufaro!

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Today holds particular significance for us here in India as we celebrate Children's Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14th. This day is dedicated to acknowledging and advocating for the well-being and rights of children, fostering an environment that supports their growth and development through various events and activities.

Wishing you a joyful Children's Day, I am eager to embark on today's session. With that said, I am ready to take on today's session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Rufaro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was hoping to receive a response from you. However, my previous message was left unattended. So, in light of that, I would like to inform you that tomorrow, the 16th of November, marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Hence, I wanted to inquire about your preparation for the payment. As your admission officer, I do not want any potential discrepancies that may lead to losing out on this offer letter. May I kindly ask about your preparation regarding the finances for the first part of your registration fee? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 71 707 5754: We haven't managed to raise the required money as yet, i have applied fr a bank loan which is taking too long to be approved, wish we could get an extension on the time frame
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for updating me on the current situation. I understand that obtaining a bank loan can sometimes take time, and I appreciate your efforts in addressing the financial requirements. So, inlight of that may I know if you are facing any challenges?
15/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Main challenge is that banks are not readily offering US loans because of the current political issues, however they promised to process as soon as they can
16/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rufaro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I understand @263717075754, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's crucial to remember that when it comes to pursuing education abroad, determination plays a significant role. The challenges you have encountered are not unique, as many students have faced similar difficulties, particularly given the current economic conditions.
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The Zimbabwean economy has been experiencing various challenges, making it tough for students who aspire to further their education. This is why many students have chosen to study in India.
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The rationale behind this decision is that pursuing education in India offers a brighter future. If they were to study in Zimbabwe under the same economic conditions, it might not provide them with the best opportunities for their personal and professional growth. Thus, it's a strategic move for their future careers. Can you relate to this perspective?
16/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I understand very well Sir, and am praying that the loan is approved, my major fear is that of having the offer letter being revoked,
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am delighted to see that we are on the same page, and I want to assure you that our team is fully committed to supporting you in overcoming this challenge and ensuring your child's career takes the right path. To better assist you, I would like to get a bit deeper into your financial plans.
16/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You mentioned the loan was unsuccessful in meeting the required amount by the due date for Rufaro's Scholarship application. Although it might not cover the entire $300 fee, I trust you've been diligently working to secure funds. To assist and respond to the university officials regarding this matter and to retain this scholarship, could you please inform me of the amount you've been able to gather for Rufaro's Scholarship application?
16/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I am rural secondary school teacher earning a salary in RTGS (local currency) and a US allowance of 285, I have no side income because most of the time I will be at work, out of this I pay Blessed's school and boarding fee though a payment plan with the school, I also support my other daughter who is in tertiary education and also my personal.needs from that. Am a single mom.of 4, my eldest children are struggling to fi d Employment here in Zimbabwe, so I was counting on getting the loan to pay fr the registration fee
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your dedication to securing educational opportunities for your children is truly commendable. Managing these financial responsibilities as a single parent while ensuring education for all your children is undoubtedly challenging. However, I'd like to inform you that missing the scholarship deadline might jeopardize Rufaro's chance of securing a seat at the university. In light of this, could you please share how much you've been able to gather so far for Rufaro's higher education journey?
16/11/23, 12:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having this information will assist me in considering our options when I meet with the academic board and have a conversation about the issue.
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I have managed to save 250us, that's best i could do
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I was also hoping that we would be considered for Full scholarship, if there is any chance, I really need this opportunity for my daughter, for us a s a family
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's clear that you've put tremendous effort into securing opportunities for your children's education. Saving $250 is a testament to your commitment. I understand the importance of this opportunity for your daughter. So with that may I know if you might be able to deposit the amount for now and I shall have a meeting with the academic board about the extension of further payments. 

Regarding the scholarship, since Rufaro is yet to receive the A-level results and once they are received, if the results are meritorious, we can certainly work towards increasing the percentage of the scholarship. Are you aligned with this approach?
16/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Yes sir, I will make effort to go and deposit the 250 I have saved
16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I admire your dedication, and I'm glad to hear about your commitment to depositing the amount you've saved. I'll proceed to discuss the extension for further payments with the academic board. Additionally, regarding the scholarship, we'll aim to reassess it once Rufaro's A-level results are received, potentially increasing the scholarship percentage if the results are meritorious. Thank you for your cooperation; I'm here to assist you through this process.
16/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Thank you very much sir
16/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Dear parent, I would like to let you know that if you happened to make the payment, please do share the payment receipt with me before the end of the day so that I can share it with the university officials for confirmation of the same.
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Am currently in the rural areas there are no banks I have to travel to town
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Understood, and I appreciate your efforts amidst the current circumstances. Your dedication to deposit the saved amount is commendable.

Given the rural setting without immediate access to banking facilities, may I know by when are you planning to make the payment?
17/11/23, 7:44 am - +263 71 707 5754: Latest I can be able to deposit is 24/11/23,
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rufaro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was not able to have a decent conversation with you as I was occupied. Regarding the payment, I've been in discussions with the academic board to address your concerns and have requested an extension to the point of the mentioned deadline.

I am happy to let you know that they have considered it and approved if drafted a formal notice. So, I would appreciate it if you could draft an email requesting an extension for this period to academicboard@edoofa.com. Please let me know once you have shared the email.
18/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Thank u I will do sp right away
18/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Please share me the screenshot once you have shared the mail.
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 707 5754: So
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I have sent a screen shot of the email
18/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 707 5754: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rufaro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I would like to let you know that you have not mentioned the deadline that was discussed with you, which was 24/11/23.
20/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Hello sir, what must I do then to rectify the omission
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright you can reply to that message mentioning the deadline.
21/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 10:49 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rufaro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was in discussion with the university official regarding the payment of your university registration fees, which have a new deadline which is today. Could you please provide me with an update on the progress of the payment?
24/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 707 5754: We sat down as a family and discussed the required money for registration, we concluded that without accessing a bank loan we cannot afford to meet the requirements, we therefore decided to  wait until A level results are out hoping the scholarship percentage increases meeting up to our financial status  .......as of now   we failed to raise enough funds sir, and since money deposited is non refundable if we fail to meet requirements,  we have stalled depositing the previously agreed us250
24/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad that you were able to sit down with your family and have a conversation regarding this case, coming to a conclusion that genuinely reflects your thorough considerations. Also, thank you for bringing up the A-level results; I believe that Rufaro did well in his exams too. With this, I would like to ask if you know how the scholarship percentage is evaluated by the university. Understanding your knowledge in this is crucial for you to know your percentage on the generated letter.
24/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 707 5754: May you please shade more light on this aspect
24/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, let me help you with this. Although one could increase their scholarship percentage based on the marks they score on their A-level. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
24/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Very clear, sir
24/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you clear about how the scholarship percentage is calculated. Now In light to our previous conversation I noticed that you were having concerns about meeting the requirements. May I know if you could please relate me on the requirements are you referring to here, please?
24/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Full registration fee and hostel fee
24/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I can see that the registration fees and the hostel fees are the challenges here. For ther registration fees you have been provided with a solution to this and you concerns regarding how the scholarship works have been relayed also with the tuition fees you are not facing any challenges. May I know the reason you backed off from the payment?
24/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I had personally managed to save 250us and applied for a loan to top up which I failed to access, we then sat down as a family and explored all possible sources of money to which we came to a conclusion that we can not raise all the money needed,  following the clause that if we fail to meet the requirement no refund will be claimed, we then decided that we wait for the results
25/11/23, 11:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Rufaro.

I appreciate the open communication and the thorough consideration your family has put into this decision regarding Rufaro's admission and the associated fees. Financial decisions are pivotal, and it's essential to evaluate them carefully.

The concerns about the registration and hostel fees are completely understandable. I'm glad that you've explored various avenues to secure the required funds. Now, coming to the topic of the amount we can keep aside for now, I wanted to let you know that you can retain this offer in the amount of $250. Which was approved by the University officials and the academic board.
25/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 707 5754: Morning sir, we decided to wait until the results are out, the fear being that she may fail to get good results,
25/11/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
25/11/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
25/11/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in January or February next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
25/11/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted your child to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 707 5754: That is true
25/11/23, 1:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So may I know what are your current thoughts for now?
27/11/23, 2:38 am - +263 71 707 5754: Am desperate, am feeling like a failure, I don't know what else I can do in order to ensure that Rufaro does not loose this chance
27/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please do not worry Rufaro will not lose out on this chance. Please, how are you doing today?
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Hello sir, thank you for reassuring us
28/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. It is understandable that these difficulties may arise and can impact plans and create uncertainty. Given the circumstances, I am your admission officer and I am here to help you out on this to help secure Rufaro's offer letter. Hence I shall be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and in that, I shall be addressing this concern about your loan. With that, I would like to know if you would be able to pay the $250 before the end of this month that is 30th of November and after that, we can work on a payment plan for the next month. The reason I am saying this is that after this month the university will be closing the round of application and I am afraid I will not be able to help you out after this date. So could you please provide me with this detail?
