09/09/23, 8:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Naomi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024.

So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
15/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Great. If I may ask, what does the admission process involve at this stage?
15/09/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. The admission process involves sharing the sharing of your academic documents with the universities where we will work on the scholarship application to be accepted. May I know if you are clear here?
15/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I understand now. Thank you for the clarity.
15/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. If you are clear shall we proceed with the session?

15/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 407 3607: This message was deleted
10/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Sorry was stuck for a bit in the traffic on the way back home. But ready now.
10/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright thank. You for letting me know.
10/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
10/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you for refreshing my memory. Yes I do remember the procedure now
10/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
10/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I am sorry that I said I remember. But because I am overwhelmed from a hectic day. I realize my mind is not clear at the moment to give you clear cut responses. If it's okay with you, I kindly request if you will be patient with me and walk me through again.
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Please go ahead
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
10/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I have understood the above.
10/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
10/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
10/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 407 3607: In the above it is stated that the $500-$750 registration fee is to be paid 2 to  4 weeks of receiving the offer letter. And below where an example of a university fees structure is given the same $750 is now required to be paid in 2 weeks time instead. Kindly clarify. Otherwise everything else seems clear for me.
10/10/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your keen attention to detail. Apologies for any confusion. Let me clarify this for you:

The registration fee, typically ranging from $500 to $750, needs to be paid within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This payment secures your seat at the university and is considered part of the first-year tuition fees.

In the example provided, where we calculated the total fee and the adjusted first-year fee, the $750 registration fee is indeed adjusted to the first-year fee. However, the example also mentions that this fee is due within two weeks of receiving the offer letter.

The bottom line is, the registration fee needs to be paid within the time frame mentioned in the offer letter, which could be two to four weeks, to secure the scholarship seat and adjust it against the first-year fee.

I hope this clarifies the matter. Please let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.
10/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you for the clarification.  I don't anymore questions for now.
10/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 407 3607: We definitely are.
10/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 407 3607: We are equally excited about the prospects our child being an Edoofian.
10/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Yes let's hear it.
10/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Let's proceed with the discussion
10/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I am following.
10/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Yes it does
10/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Sure it does
10/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Registration fees payment time framework is well understood.
10/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Please do provide more information on it.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you. I now get it.
10/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Yes I do
10/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Clear.
10/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Indeed I clear on it.
10/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I get it
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I understand that in our case, our child is yet to set for her A level exams this year. Meaning to say that universities will be using past academic records, statement of entry and Edoofa's recommendations right? Which assures her of provisional admission with a minimum of 50% scholarship. I have understood that if she does better, that will be re evaluated. What category is 10 points and above likely to be in terms of the percentage of the scholarship after re-evaluation from your past experiences?
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I am sorry. Still at work. However I will be available around 1730 hrs
12/10/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for updating me on your availability. Please feel free to reach out when you're ready, and we'll proceed with our discussion.
12/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you for your patience. I will do so.
12/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I am sorry for coming back to you this late. I got delayed at work. I am now ready.
12/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is all alright, Regarding your concern here.  Although one could increase their scholarship percentage based on the marks they score on their A-level. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
12/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I am clear. Thank you
12/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Naomi's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Naomi is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

12/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.

12/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Well noted with thanks.
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and NAomi.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admissions Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Naomi!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Good afternoon Mr Milan. Yes we saw the offer letter from the university but like I requested in the above text this weekend has been hectic and we wanted with your permission to move the discussion tomorrow as I will be off duty.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, we will then connect with each other here tomorrow and continue with our discussion regarding the offer letter please.
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 407 3607: We pray for a speedy recovery from this fever.
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Tomorrow then
15/10/23, 9:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Good Night and thank you for your wish ☺️
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Naomi!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can start with our discussion here regarding the offer letter now?
16/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 439 8208: Good morning. Indeed we are well today. I hope you too are doing well today. Yes let's go ahead with the discussion now.
16/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
16/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 407 3607: Yes we did go through the letter
16/10/23, 12:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 407 3607: 1. $900usd
2. 4 years 
3. $300
4. $750 which will allow for a waiver. I hope I got this one correct.
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 407 3607: The university's stance on giving students the opportunity to visit the campus and check for themselves is in itself commendable. As this allows them to be able to make a choice as to what they would prefer. Thank you for highlighting that.
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Indeed we are together.
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Clear.
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Yes.
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 407 3607: My preference is the above here.
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 407 3607: We are on the same page. And have made gone for the option above as I have stated.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I am currently based in Masvingo
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Noted with thanks.
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Received. Thank you. I will get in touch with him. In terms letting him know about us paying for Naomi, how would you want us to introduce ourselves as we start the conversation?
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Naomi!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: You can connect with him normally, by mentioning that you are a part of the Edoofa Program please.
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Naomi!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Noted with thanks. 8:30pm is okay with us
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Naomi!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Naomi!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here yesterday at the scheduled time, however, I believe due to some challenges that you may have faced, you were not able to connect with me. Now, on that note, can you please let me know if we can move ahead with our conversation now?
20/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Good day Mr Milan. Our apologies for not connecting yesterday. We had an emergency yesterday. And we had to attend to it.
20/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Let's have the discussion today at 8:30pm.
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening! May I know if we can move ahead with the discussion now?
20/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Good evening. Yes we can do so
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall I share Mr. Shorwi's details with you here?
20/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 407 3607: I would prefer this as it is 5% cheaper than Mr Shorwi's
20/10/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright you can do that, however, for reference, let me share the details here once again:

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 407 3607: That's okay
20/10/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 407 3607: The off - campus accommodation is self catering right?
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 407 3607: And the on - campus one is $2000 for 3 and $2500 for 2?
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Hopefully I understood that correctly
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, you are correct. The off-campus accommodation is self-catering, and the on-campus options are as follows:

On-campus accommodation for 3 students: $2000 per annum
On-campus accommodation for 2 students: $2500 per annum
If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Do students who opt for off campus have to commute?
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 407 3607: If so how much are the fares?
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a great question. I'm happy to inform you that all the off-campus accommodations we offer are conveniently located within walking distance from the university. So, students who opt for off-campus housing won't have to worry about long commutes. They can easily reach the university without the need for transportation. This provides a convenient and cost-effective housing option for our students.
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Do these accommodation facilities work in partnership with the university or they are strictly private? I ask so because my concern is the security of my child especially away from the university?
20/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
20/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Yes I get it. Thank you. I am done with my questions for now.
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Clear on it
20/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 407 3607: On the EWYL program, does not interfere with the studies? Is it compulsory for the students to do it?
20/10/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a great question. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits while they study. It does not interfere with your regular academic studies. It's meant to be a flexible way for students to gain work experience, develop skills, and earn scholarship credits. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: As it's getting late on my end, I'd like to schedule our next conversation for tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT. This will give us ample time to continue our discussion about the offer letter and map out the next steps in your admission process. I kindly request that you ensure your presence at the mentioned time to make the most of our session. Wishing you a good night, and I anticipate our conversation tomorrow.
21/10/23, 8:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Naomi!

I hope you had a restful night and are feeling refreshed today. I'm eager to continue our discussion about your offer letter and the next steps in your admission process. To ensure we make the most of our session, I kindly request that you confirm your availability at this time.
21/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 407 3607: Good morning. Indeed we had a restful night. Hope you have had the same. Yes we are now ready
21/10/23, 9:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I had a blessed night as well. Moving ahead, shall we proceed with our discussion here?
21/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 407 3607: We are glad to know that you had. Please go ahead
21/10/23, 9:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
21/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 407 3607: Yes I am
21/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 407 3607: Not now. Let's proceed.
21/10/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
21/10/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you very much. On taking a virtual tour of the university, I have to do it in the evening due to poor connection.
21/10/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on Monday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
21/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 407 3607: Well noted with much thanks. We will definitely discuss this joyous moment and come back to you once we are done.
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Have a good day ahead.
21/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you. Same to you too.
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Naomi!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
23/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 407 3607: Good morning Mr Milan Singh. Yes we are very excited about this offer letter from Galgotias University. And we have been to talk over the past few days as  her parents as Naomi has started her national examinations. So we decided to let her focus on them whilst we see how we can help on this.
23/10/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
23/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 407 3607: Okay. The discussion was obviously and naturally excited about the prospect of our child studying in India which has far better standards that here. And the possibilities of her exposure in India as a country that has make tremendous strides in development as a country from the researches we have been doing. Our concern mainly has been the EWYL part. Though you explained this we questioned as to, will this not be a distraction from her studies she will be required earn her points in that regard. Because our hope is that she she should be exclusively focused on the studies without other activities to work on. We asked ourselves what if she does not meet the points she will required to earn. What does that mean to the scholarship?
23/10/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns with me. I completely understand your excitement about the opportunity and your concerns regarding the EWYL Program. It's great that you've done some research and are actively thinking about Naomi's education and future.
23/10/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: I want to address your concerns about the EWYL program. The program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to gain practical experience and earn scholarship credits while pursuing their studies. It's not intended to be a distraction from their studies, but rather a valuable addition to their higher education. The mentors in this case ensure that students can balance their academic requirements with their participation in the program. I hope this is clear?
23/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 407 3607: I hear you. Let me discuss with my wife when we get this evening.
23/10/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, you can do that please. Moving ahead, if I may ask do you have any other queries to ask?
23/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 407 3607: No I don't.
23/10/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
23/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 407 3607: Thank you very much for your patience in all of this. Unfortunately we were unable to research via the links you gave because we have a power cut because of the rains. But today should be doing so as the power company is fixing it. And have assured us that we will be having power today
23/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I would advise you to do that as well. Now, as you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
23/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 407 3607: Good day Mr Singh. I am sorry I got tied up with that something that needed my urgent attention. I wanted to ask if it's possible to take option of paying $600 by the 28th of November?

28/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Naomi,

I trust this message finds you well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of $512 towards your balance registration fee by today, 28th November 2023 However, it has been over fifteen days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are approaching the closure of the current rounds of scholarship applications on November 30th, it is important that we share an update with the university before the same deadline. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected.

I also noticed that you were able to review my previous messages, but unfortunately, you did not respond. This leads me to believe that you may be facing challenges preventing you from connecting with us. Am I correct in my understanding?
28/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 407 8479: Hello Mr Shivjeet. My apologies for not responding in time to your earlier follow up. I have been working in the remote areas where network connectivity is not good. 

I am now back home. Though I note with concern that the communication you sent at 1318 hrs today above seems to contradict what we had agreed on a communication we did on the 25th of October 2023. The same communication was also made by email to this email address, academicboard@edoofa.com. We agreed on a payment plan with Mr Milan as follows;
1. PAYMENT OF $120 BE MADE BY THE 28TH OF OCTOBER 2023.
2. PAYMENT OF $280 BY THE 30TH OF NOVEMBER 2023.
3. FINAL PAYMENT OF $300 BY THE 23RD OF DECEMBER 2023.

So I am wondering where the $512 by the 28th of November is coming from? And because of this I want to inform you that I having second thoughts on my daughter continuing with this route. The fact that the communication was sent by email as well is what worries me as a parent. What's app messages can be lost easily but not on email.
28/11/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: hank you for reaching me in the conversation here and clearing the doubt. I would like to let you know that what you are saying is indeed accurate and I shall expect the payment of $280 by 30th of November.
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 407 8479: In that regard I am no longer interested in my child studying in India.
28/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know what happened ?
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 407 8479: It seems to me that facts were not verified before the follow up. And that is important to me. And that you didn't bother to apologies for this error you just acknowledged the it. Again that is important for me as a parent. Because I am thinking I am entrusting my child to your care? I am sorry I have just my questions. And I am no longer comfortable anymore.
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 407 8479: * It seems to me that facts were not verified before the follow up. And that is important to me. And that you didn't bother to apologize for this error you just acknowledged it. Again that is important for me as a parent. Because I am thinking I am entrusting my child to your care in terms of the whole journey including now. I am sorry I have just had my questions. And I am no longer comfortable anymore.
