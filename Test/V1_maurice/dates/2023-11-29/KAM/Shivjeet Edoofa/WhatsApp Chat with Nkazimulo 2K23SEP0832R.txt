18/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
21/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir you can move on
21/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

21/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

21/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to schedule our session fo 7:30 PM tomorrow. I hope by that time you might be able to watch the videos. Have a great night.
21/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Thank you , good night too
22/09/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Good evening sir, it is good news to have a rest we come back rejuvenated , otherwise we are fine sir
22/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
22/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes I did sir
22/09/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
22/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Besically the videos encourages students to be objective, focused,open minded, and to follow instructions if they are to be successful in their carrier.
Also mentioned is the issue of qualified personnel, there's careful selection of schools and universities, inspection of the facilities is a requirement to see if the facilities meet the expectations.
Education being made affordable .
They're life changing opportunities,a lot of success stories,
Students can Earn while learning to further pay their fees.
In brief this is what I grasped.
22/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
22/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
22/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
22/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
22/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir
22/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
22/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 7:30 PM.
22/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

04/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 263 6730: 2. The importance of entrepreneurship in policy has grown. Policymakers benefit from understanding the connections between entrepreneurship and economic development globally since it serves as a guide for their work. The rising trend in entrepreneurial innovation is crucial for competitiveness, economic expansion, and job creation. Advanced economy policymakers should be aware of both revolutions, understand their causes and effects, and adjust their strategies accordingly.

04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.

07/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Thank you sir,we are all fine, that's fine I hope by then I would have received the statement of entry
09/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?

I am doing great, thank you for asking.
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Evening sir, I'm ready
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 263 6730: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 263 6730: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 263 6730: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Very accurate
09/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 263 6730: As a parent I'm ready unless if it's specifically directed to Nkazimulo
09/10/23, 6:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We can indeed proceed with the parents as well. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 263 6730: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 263 6730: True
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Thank you for teh O Levvel. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Correct
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 5:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
10/10/23, 12:25 am - +263 77 263 6730: Thank you, good night
10/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Afternoon, I'm ready
10/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are clear about the above break up.
10/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir
10/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
10/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
10/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 263 6730: You mean I have to pay $750 by 2
10/10/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed by time span of 2 weeks.
10/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Ok
10/10/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so that we can proceed with the session?
10/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes
10/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
10/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 263 6730: If my memory serves me well upon securing the schoolarship letter from the university I'm supposed to pay between $500-$750
10/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 263 6730: The specific amounts of schoolarship will be mentioned in the offer letter from the university
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
10/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
10/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 263 6730: That's good news
10/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 263 6730: I'm ready but would prefer to receive the letter from the university around 20 October so that I don't miss the deadline
10/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed you will. I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 263 6730: We can proceed
10/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 263 6730: This is good news
10/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir it does
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir it sounds good, it's too indeed good news
10/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 263 6730: This serves as a great relief to parents or guardians
10/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 263 6730: It's based on A Level statement of entry, responses to Academic interview questions and statement of purpose
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 263 6730: True there are benefits for being an Edoofian
10/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes I agree
10/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Clear
10/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Clear
10/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 702 3816: This message was deleted
10/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Ok
10/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Currently no questions
10/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Nkazimulo's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Nkazimulo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir
10/10/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Nkazimulo's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 5:32 am - +263 77 263 6730: Thank you
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwa.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Gulzar Group of Institutes in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 6:40 am - +263 77 263 6730: Morning, I'm sure you mistakenly sent addressed Nkazimulo as Tadiwa or else there's a mix-up
16/10/23, 11:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nkazimulo!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, kindly excuse me for that, however, the letter was addressed to Nkazimulo himself. Moving ahead, please go through the letter and then we will connect with each other at the scheduled time please.
16/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Ok thank you
16/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Good afternoon sir,I have gone through the offer letter
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 263 6730: 1) tuition fees is 1000 USD after the scholarship.
2)Accomodation fee is 1200 USD
3) I'm supposed to pay 600 USD.
16/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Point of correct on number 3) I'm supposed to pay 300 USD now then the balance in November
16/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1000.
16/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
16/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1000 + $1250) = $2250.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1000 + $1000) = $2000.
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 263 6730: For 3 seater it means they're 3 beds in one room and the same for a 4 seater?
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear that is right. Now, Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
16/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 263 6730: I'm the parent,I think a 3 seater is ok for her
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 263 6730: So in this case the due date is 2 November
17/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 263 6730: Morning,is there any alternative account we can use here in Zimbabwe
17/10/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nkazimulo!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we are coming to discuss that moving ahead during our discussion here. Now, You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for three-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2250 which can be paid in two parts of $1125 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Clear sir
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir I'm clear
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2250 and so the balance fee becomes $2250 - $1000 = $1250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
17/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 263 6730: This is true empowerment
17/10/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
17/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2250, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2250 - $750= $1500, and that can be paid in two parts of $750 at a gap of 6 months (August 2024/January 2025). 

Are we on the same page here as well?
17/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Yes we are
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nkazimulo!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 29th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Afternoon sir, yes I'm clear
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 263 6730: Thank you sir,I will contact him when I have raised the cash
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 263 6730: This is the best for me considering the distance between Harare and Bulawayo
18/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

19/10/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nkazimulo!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from GGI. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from GGI as a family yet?
19/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 263 6730: Morning, Nkazimulo is currently busy writing her final exams but I managed to send her the offer letter, she is quite happy and also us as family we are happy,she was asking if the university above is the one where she is going for her tertiary education.
19/10/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, since she has received the offer letter from GGI, she will be going there for her higher education. Moving ahead, It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 263 6730: I realised that on accomodation you mentioned 3 and 4 seater hostels,do you have 2 seater hostels?
In terms of security how safe are foreigners in India, besically those are the questions we have otherwise we are ready to go,I like the fact that you put into consideration the issue of splitting fees into 2 equal instalments, this will go a long way in lessening the pressure of raising the fees.thank you very much.
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your questions, and I'm delighted to hear about your readiness and positive outlook regarding Nkazimulo's higher education journey. Let me address your concerns:

As per the latest updates from the university, the 3-seater option is not currently available. The only option available is the 4-seater hostel. The university aims to provide comfortable and secure accommodation for its students. This means Nkazimulo will be staying in a 4-seater hostel, and the university will make sure that she has a conducive living environment.
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to the concern regarding safety that you have mentioned here. On that note, I wold like to mention that India is a diverse and welcoming country, and many international students study there every year. Indian universities, including GGI, take security seriously and have all the necessary measures in place to ensure the safety of their students. While it's important to take general precautions, as you would when living in any new place, there are support systems and guidance available for international students. Nkazimulo will also have access to the university's resources and support services to help her navigate her new environment. I hope you understand that.
19/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 263 6730: Perfect if it's like that,we really appreciate.
19/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 263 6730: I think the offer letter is clear sir
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
19/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 263 6730: Not yet sir
19/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I would highly advise you to do so. Now, since the university has given you a date of 29th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
19/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 263 6730: Yes sir,I will go for the first one, paying $300 then clear the balance in November
19/10/23, 11:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
19/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 263 6730: I'm sure on the 27 th of October and I will use the FBC account for Mr Charles Jerera
19/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
