*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
14/10/23, 7:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I am happy to let you know that I am available today a little bit early as it is the weekend and very much ready to take on our session with full productivity. Please let me know so that we can continue our session and wrap it up early.
14/10/23, 8:16 am - +263 71 241 2855: I am ready for discussion. Good morning
14/10/23, 8:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 241 2855: Thank you so much for jogging my memory.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
14/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 241 2855: Do you mean my understanding of stage 4? or the first 3 stages. Excuse my asking
14/10/23, 8:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize, and thank you for seeking clarification. I would like to understand your brief understanding of the first 3 stages that we have covered.
14/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 241 2855: Stage one was a brief outline of the Edoofa program and its importance. Stage 2 its importance and its contribution towards assisting students achieve their academic carrer. Stage three discussion on the available faculties one can take up, fees structures and other opportunities while you learn (EWYL).
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 71 241 2855: Yes we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 9:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
14/10/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 241 2855: Well understood
14/10/23, 11:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/10/23, 11:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 241 2855: I have read and understood the benefits
16/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
17/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 241 2855: I am ready to proceed.
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Well understood thank you for the clarification
17/10/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes it does
17/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 241 2855: True it does
17/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 241 2855: I have understood the terms
17/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 241 2855: I think so far so good
17/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 241 2855: I do agree
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes am clear
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?

08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Do we have options to other Universities apart from the one that has offered us scholarship for comparison purposes.
08/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter. Which will be discussed in detail soon.

Regarding the registration fee that you will be required to pay for the current university. Do not worry about it, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
08/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 241 2855: If we pay for the offer letter now and we get another offer from another university will we be required to pay another $700.00
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No you you are not. It can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you can enjoy this privilege as an Edoofian. This is one of the advantages we offer to our students in terms of affordability and choices. Are you clear on this?
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Does the Scholarship cover only Tuition fees excluding accomodation.
08/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, the scholarship typically covers only the tuition fees. Accommodation, living expenses, and other costs are usually separate from the scholarship. During our upcoming sessions, we can discuss the details of the scholarship offered and clarify what expenses it includes. So, shall we now proceed?
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 241 2855: lets proceed
08/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 241 2855: [08/11, 19:34] Bessie: Does the university have the option to change the program
[08/11, 19:36] Bessie: Tariro is now considering  Bio medical engineering as an option. is this an option?
08/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 241 2855: That's very clear
08/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
08/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Thank you
09/11/23, 9:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tariro. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 350 7185: Morning am ready
09/11/23, 9:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that with further continuation of the session. Now, I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
09/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 350 7185: Onem9re question on accommodation.  If one prefers off campus accommodation.  That 1200usd, is it shared between the two or it's per individual
09/11/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely let me help you here Tariro can choose to live in the said accomodation with one of your local Eddofians who will be arriving in a batch wise by the time of arrival in India and the student has the option to stay together and if he prefers to stay alone that is also possible and the price wil be under the same cost as well only the minor change is the difference in the apartment that Tariro wil be staying in. May I now if you are clear here?
09/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 350 7185: Yes sir
09/11/23, 10:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
09/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to please be a little proactive on our session with the offer letter, it is very crucial for Tariro's Higher education journey and it is going to be shaping your child's future giving us the importance of this letter discussion to be completed in a timely manner to avoid delays. So may I know if we are still connected with the session? @263783507185
09/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 350 7185: Yes am still connected.  Thank you I was not aware on this. Now I understand.
09/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 350 7185: Let's move on sir
09/11/23, 11:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
09/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 350 7185: That's great,thank you so much
09/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 350 7185: Yes we are together
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
09/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes sir
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes
09/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 350 7185: No we don't have that account
09/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes we stay in harare
09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 350 7185: I think it's easier method
09/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
09/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes so that we have a choice
09/11/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/11/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
09/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes
09/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
09/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Much understood,  then with scholarship
09/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
09/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
09/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Yes am following
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tariro. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I understand Tariro's decision, and it's crucial to pursue what aligns best with her aspirations. However, may I know if you could please relate me to the sudden loss of interest?

23/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall. I was going through the subject combination for Tariro's A-levels and noticed that one of the subjects, Physics, was not taken by Tariro. I would like to know the subject combination required for a student to be eligible for a medical degree in India. It includes Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Additionally, after that, one has to appear for an entrance exam called NEET for the degree, which is one of the most competitive exams in India. Are you clear up to this point now?

23/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, in order to help you out in the best possible way, may I know which field in the medical field Tariro is genuinely interested in?

23/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 350 7185: I don't know in India what do you do
23/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's crucial to align Tariro's aspirations with the specific areas of specialization required in medicine. For example, if they are interested in fields such as orthopedics, cardiology, or surgery. Please let me know if you understand my point here?
23/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 350 7185: Evening. She wants to specialize with gynecology
23/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know the inclination towards gynecology
25/11/23, 8:53 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tariro!

25/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 350 7185: Psychology yes but she needs medical application
25/11/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand. However I would like to let you know that for a field nin Medical it would not be possible as Tariro is not eligible for a medical degree in india because of the lack of Physics in the A Level
