Are you ready to begin your today's session🚀
06/11/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 157 1376: Good morning
06/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: So resuming our session, may I have a response on this please.
06/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263774346942 @263778616709 I would really like a response on this as Seith is busy with his examinations, so you must respond in the session on his behalf.
06/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 157 1376: Yes
06/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 157 1376: Today l don't have an examination l can fill in for my father he is at work
06/11/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand and please make sure that you respond on time,
06/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 157 1376: Yes
06/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 157 1376: No problem
06/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like a response on this.
06/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 157 1376: What are the objectives
06/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 157 1376: Ohhh l understand ma'am
06/11/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
06/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 157 1376: Nice to me you  Ms. Davi and  Ms.  Sanjana
06/11/23, 9:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
06/11/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 157 1376: Noted
06/11/23, 10:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

06/11/23, 10:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 157 1376: Will do my best to make sure l help you achieve these goals together in any way possible
06/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's great!
06/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that you will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
06/11/23, 10:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is.
06/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 157 1376: I don't think l fully understand project
06/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 157 1376: 1
06/11/23, 4:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Don't worry I will explain it in detail to you once you are back from exams.
Be on time for your session tomorrow.
06/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 157 1376: Okay ma'am thank you
09/11/23, 1:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
