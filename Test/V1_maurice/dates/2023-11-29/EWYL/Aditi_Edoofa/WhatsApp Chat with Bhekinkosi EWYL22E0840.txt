Wishing you a wonderful day ahead
16/08/23, 10:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 994 9968: Wow this is nice and all understand
16/08/23, 10:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 994 9968: Yes l am aware
16/08/23, 10:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Would you like to share your thoughts?
16/08/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 994 9968: I would like to say that the grant Challenge is a good thing and it helps to  motivate the students and as well as to help the students financially because the Grant will be helping
16/08/23, 10:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct!
16/08/23, 10:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: But the reason that you have been awarded this grant is your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion has not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 994 9968: Thank you l am truly owned
16/08/23, 10:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 994 9968: Understand ma'am
16/08/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 994 9968: Understood ma'am and will not stop here
16/08/23, 10:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: That would be fantastic!

If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our discussions. <This message was edited>

21/08/23, 9:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Bhekinkosi.
Hope that you are doing well.

I'd also want to bring up the fact that we've noticed your inconsistency in attending sessions. If this pattern persists, there's a possibility that your grant could be taken away. It would be advisable for you to improve your attendance record, be more proactive, and dedicate more effort to your projects. <This message was edited>
21/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 994 9968: Sorry ma'am l will try to improve but at my end l am facing connection problems
21/08/23, 9:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Bhekinkosi, there have been several warnings issued already, no excuses would be entertained.
21/08/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 994 9968: Understand ma'am
23/08/23, 10:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
23/08/23, 10:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls when you would be in India.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities. <This message was edited>

Bhekinkosi, I hope that you are aware that you are a grant student and there are certain expectations set for you for being disciplined and regular in your sessions and work diligently on your projects unfortunately you are doing none of these and if this continues I cannot guarantee you that if you would be eligible to redeem your grant as your attendance has stooped down a lot.
I hope you take my words seriously and next time reply to my messages and come  for your sessions on the EWYL line regularly.

) Student's journey so far with the program,

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 6:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263779949968 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 1:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263779949968 , 
I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 7:00 PM*
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Noted ma’am
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Ma’am l am ready for tonight’s session
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Yes l am ready ma’am
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Yes l am very curious about the Grants
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Yes l do remember
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 994 9968: I recall that the Grant can not be redeemed as personal money but can be used for payment of fees 
And also if you don’t attend your sessions the Grant can be taken away
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Thank you ma’am
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Thank you for the motivation l will keep on trying
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Okay noted that you ma’am
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Okay ma’am
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Ma’am quick question have you attended to the forms l have submitted
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Bhekinkosi, I have forwarded these to the Counselors and they will reach out to them as soon as possible.
But let me also tell you it takes around 2-3 weeks, okay?
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 994 9968: Okay thank ma’am
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	       0/6
Attendance	3/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 994 9968: From September to October last year have only missed out only 1 session only
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are wrapping up this session and we will continue this exactly from where we left.
So we will meet for this chat session *tomorrow at 7 PM*.🚀
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I will confirm and let you know this by tomorrow
