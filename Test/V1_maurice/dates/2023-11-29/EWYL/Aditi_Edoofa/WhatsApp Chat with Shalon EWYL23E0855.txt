07/11/23, 3:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session, let's try to make the next session more productive. Be on time for tomorrow's session.

08/11/23, 8:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 8:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome! It's great to hear that you believe this program will help you achieve your educational and career goals. Attending a good university can indeed be a significant step in enhancing your career prospects and personal growth. Is there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss further regarding your educational journey or career aspirations? I'm here to assist you with any questions or advice you may need.
08/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 430 4990: As of now no questions since the previous personnels well elaborated many crucial things in the discussions held prior to this one thank you
08/11/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!

08/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Greetings
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Yes l am ready
08/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 886 5952: I am not aware about the two objectives
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Well understood
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Great. I am happy to be interacting with Ms. Davi and Ms. Sanjana. Thank you.
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
08/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 886 5952: It is very interesting
08/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 886 5952: So do l get to choose the dates for my sessions or you are the one who decides
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes you will get to choose.
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

08/11/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok great
08/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Let me read them first, thank you.

08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
08/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 886 5952: That is wonderful
08/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Wonderful thank you
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 430 4990: Yes let's proceed

08/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 886 5952: 4. The Hall of Inspiration is where students share their different life stories which inspire one to be great, and it also teaches the difference perspective about life. Thank you.
08/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 886 5952: I am now having poor network connection
08/11/23, 4:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Noted.

20/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Greetings, Ms Aditi
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday @263788865952 !
Wishing you a day filled with enthusiasm, productivity, and all-around happiness. 

Are you ready for the session🚀
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Yes, l am ready.
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok let's proceed
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SHALON/ADITI/20NOV23*
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok good
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Do l make it a link in which people join by themselves or l make l create a group with added people already
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can do it whatever way that suits you.
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263788865952 May I know if it's okay till now?
20/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 886 5952: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Yes, it is okay
20/11/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/11/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok good

23/11/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's okay, give him some time.
23/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
23/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 886 5952: So l should share these with him after he responds to the first message
23/11/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No, Shalon first explain him about Edoofa Program ask if he is interested and then if he is interested then share this with him.

23/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok now it is clear, thank you.

24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
24/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok, noted
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 886 5952: I ask my mentor for support, right
24/11/23, 1:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I will always be there to support you.
24/11/23, 1:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
24/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Ok, great
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Lemme create my instagram username
24/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
24/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
24/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
24/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
24/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 886 5952: Tuesday and Friday

▪️Sharing project updates
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

26/11/23, 12:05 am - +263 78 886 5952: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the Spirit of Competition.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
