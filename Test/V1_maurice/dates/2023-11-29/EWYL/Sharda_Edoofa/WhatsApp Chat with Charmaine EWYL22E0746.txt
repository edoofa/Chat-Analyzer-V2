How are you today?
23/09/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 9:12 am - +27 79 978 1832: Good morning. Charmaine is currently at school with no access to a phone.

We are happy to complete her sessions and would prefer the 08:30am to 09:30am session
23/09/23, 9:35 am - +91 78273 08969: Thank you, we will have the session at the scheduled time.
25/09/23, 8:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Charmaine will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that Charmaine is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
25/09/23, 8:44 am - +27 79 978 1832: Thank you
25/09/23, 8:46 am - +91 78273 08969: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/09/23, 9:22 am - +27 72 629 2838: First objective is to make sure that Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st century  skills which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market making them ready to begin their professional careers 

Then also you help Edoofians to self finance their education
25/09/23, 9:23 am - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Charmaine is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/09/23, 9:24 am - +27 72 629 2838: Ok
25/09/23, 9:27 am - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/09/23, 9:27 am - +27 72 629 2838: Thank you, its a pleasure to meet you all
25/09/23, 9:35 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Charmaine to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 9:36 am - +27 72 629 2838: Yes, sure
25/09/23, 9:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Charmaine forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 9:38 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:39 am - +27 72 629 2838: Received thank you
25/09/23, 9:47 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Charmaine*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Charmaine* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
25/09/23, 9:49 am - +27 79 978 1832: Great, thank you
25/09/23, 9:50 am - +91 78273 08969: Let us connect tomorrow at the same time.
Have a blessed day.
25/09/23, 10:26 am - +27 72 629 2838: Noted, thank you
26/09/23, 10:16 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I am sorry to inform you that there won't be any session today as I have to attend to some urgent paperwork. Your sessions are rescheduled for tomorrow at the same time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Thank you, and I look forward to our session tomorrow.
26/09/23, 10:23 am - +27 79 978 1832: Noted, thank you
27/09/23, 8:30 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today? <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 8:33 am - +27 79 978 1832: Morning
27/09/23, 8:35 am - +91 78273 08969: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Charmaine will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
27/09/23, 8:35 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 8:40 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?
It is time for our session.
28/09/23, 8:41 am - +27 79 978 1832: Morning
28/09/23, 8:41 am - +27 79 978 1832: We are good
28/09/23, 8:46 am - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you have read the document?
28/09/23, 8:47 am - +27 79 978 1832: Yes I did
28/09/23, 8:49 am - +91 78273 08969: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Charmaine* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Charmaine* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
28/09/23, 8:52 am - +27 79 978 1832: Well noted, thank you
28/09/23, 8:53 am - +27 79 978 1832: Currently the challenge we have is Charmaine is mostly at school with limited time and no access to her phone
28/09/23, 8:55 am - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. 
Charmaine will have the sessions on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
Once she is back from school.
28/09/23, 8:57 am - +27 79 978 1832: Yes, once she is back she can definitely do that. She finishes her exams on November 17
28/09/23, 8:57 am - +27 79 978 1832: I hope it won't be too late for university applications and other processes
28/09/23, 8:58 am - +91 78273 08969: No, It won't be late.
28/09/23, 8:59 am - +91 78273 08969: SECOND- In the sessions, the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
28/09/23, 9:01 am - +27 79 978 1832: Ok, noted
28/09/23, 9:02 am - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/09/23, 9:02 am - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa EWYL.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 9:34 am - +27 79 978 1832: This doesn't look like a group
28/09/23, 9:35 am - +91 78273 08969: This is a contact, This is not a group. 
When she comes she will have her sessions there.
Other information will be shared here in the group.
28/09/23, 9:36 am - +27 79 978 1832: So the sessions will happen outside the group? Why is the approach changing?
28/09/23, 9:38 am - +91 78273 08969: This is the process When the initial onboarding is done. the student will have their session on this line.
28/09/23, 9:44 am - +27 79 978 1832: Ok
28/09/23, 9:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Her session will be on Monday and Thursday from 12:00-1:30 PM. In the session, the following are requirements to be followed.

29/09/23, 10:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Charmaine,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

21/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: "Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." – Winston S. Churchill

I hope this quote inspires you as we embark on our session today. Let's navigate through our discussions with enthusiasm and a positive mindset. Ready to dive in?

21/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:57 pm - +27 79 069 2506: noted
21/11/23, 2:01 pm - +27 79 069 2506: understood
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am waiting for you to share your understanding of the audio.
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - +27 72 629 2838: She is coming to respond the downloading is slow where she is
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parent
Thank you for informing about the slow network at Charmaine's place.
21/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is time to wrap up today’s session. 
I noticed you were active at the beginning—awesome! But you have not been responding to anything after that.

It is important to stay active throughout the session, in order to get the most out of it.
Your engagement is valued, I hope to see you active throughout,  from our next session which is tomorrow.
23/11/23, 10:25 am - +27 79 069 2506: Good morning! 

From the audio that you shared I've understood that
All Edoofians have a great sense of community building which refers to the process of strengthening connections and relationships among individuals within a particular group or community and this makes individuals to be able to communicate and this creates a sense of belonging.
The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community and it promotes social interaction.
I also understood that the primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and learn how to leverage social media and enquire international education that prepares them for a future.
I also noted that this project encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly.
Students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools and have also completed their secondary education or are currently in their final year of senior secondary education
Students are also expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help their organisation group.
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Charmaine*

I hope you are doing well
To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it is our session time are you ready for it?

23/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

23/11/23, 2:58 pm - +27 79 069 2506: I was waiting for your response since 14:19 but  l thought you had some network problems
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: From next time please you are reminding me about all this.

24/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Charmaine*

Let's start our session with a bit of inspiration:

"Your attitude determines your direction."
Now, let's talk about this quote. It means that the way you approach things in life can shape where you're headed. Having a positive mindset and facing challenges with determination can lead to great things.
I'm also curious to know how things are going for you. How has your day been? Feel free to share anything on your mind before we begin our session.
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
Also, do let me know the reason behind your absense.

27/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
27/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
27/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

28/11/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Charmaine 
I hope you are doing well

I think you have communicated your concern in the wrong group. Any admission and college related query need to be communicated in the admissions group.
28/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: "Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs' quote emphasizes the preciousness of time and encourages us to live authentically. It reminds us to prioritize our own passions and pursuits rather than conforming to external expectations.

As we start our session, let's reflect on this quote. Now, how are you doing? I'm eager to hear about your thoughts and experiences as we continue our discussion.
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - +27 79 069 2506: I'm doing great thank you and that side?
