I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 8:30 am to 9:30 am.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our Edoofa Welfare officer joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

27/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: very quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 530 5332: My pleasure
27/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 530 5332: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 530 5332: I've learnt that 


Corporate alliance has to do with identifying the market i plan to enter in the future and start preparing on it at an early stage and as a result of the pandemic, there's a great platform for connecting with technology companies and digitally driven companies. My goal is to identify such companies within my region and to accomplish this i could start with my immediate network, family members or parents of friends who work in the same sector and open up to them about my objectives on how Edoofa has impacted skills that will enlarge my employability in the future after graduation. Additionally I could open a LinkedIn account which is a professional networking platform which allows me to search for companies and connect with their employers . Through LinkedIn i should reach out to managers , heads of large organisational companies initiating conversations with them and trying to open up meetings with Edoofa. Creating a LinkedIn account will expland my professional network enhancing creditability and increasing chances of securing internships and finding employment within my country.


Additional to this i have downloaded the LinkedIn account ma'am now may you please guide me in creating an effective LinkedIn account
27/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Munashe. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

27/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You can go through the document after our session today.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now move to project 2

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 530 5332: The community building project is a project which allows for Edoofians to connect with other fellow members of the society and tell them about the scholarship program and how it has been with them, they get to share their experiences with the scholarship program and invite the fellow members to the program this will also improve the employability in the future simultaneously it increases the scholarship credits of the referee. Students who create online networks to connect with their fellow members and eduffer will support them. Inviting students in their final high school year in some fellow community members who are aspiring to go for tertiary education incorporating them into the scholarship program we will increase my scholarship credit

28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
