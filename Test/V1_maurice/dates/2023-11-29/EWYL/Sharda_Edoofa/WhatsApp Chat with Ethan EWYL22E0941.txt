Hope you are doing well!

Your welcome please!
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ethan

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 889 2517: Option 2 is better
15/09/23, 9:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ethan. See you tomorrow at our scheduled session.
15/09/23, 9:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Text me five minutes before our session that you are ready for the session. Okay?

09/11/23, 11:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Ethan
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

20/11/23, 8:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it's our session time.
Are you ready for the same?
20/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 889 2517: Yeah
20/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 889 2517: Good morning
20/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Ethan, please ensure you are joining our sessions at the exact time. You joining in late restricts our learning.
20/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Welcome! As you embark on this journey, keep in mind the words of Walt Disney: "All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them." Let's work together to turn your dreams into reality!
20/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 889 2517: Ok Noted
20/11/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you remember the last discussion we had was on the third project - *PROJECT 3: AFRICAN SCHOOL EDUCATION REFORM MISSION PROJECT*
20/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 889 2517: Yes
20/11/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we move ahead, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
20/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 889 2517: Milton High School 
Bulawayo province
20/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 889 2517: My school is already connected with edoofa
20/11/23, 10:06 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
20/11/23, 10:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree? 

Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
20/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 889 2517: Okay
20/11/23, 10:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
20/11/23, 10:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Ethan, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.

After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
20/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 889 2517: Ok noted
20/11/23, 10:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.


I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

21/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today." – Franklin D. Roosevelt

21/11/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: That's fantastic! Playing football is a great way to stay active, build teamwork skills, and enjoy the thrill of the game. Whether you play for fun with friends or as part of a formal team, football can provide numerous physical and social benefits.
21/11/23, 9:05 am - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
21/11/23, 9:05 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

21/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 889 2517: Yes
21/11/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
21/11/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
