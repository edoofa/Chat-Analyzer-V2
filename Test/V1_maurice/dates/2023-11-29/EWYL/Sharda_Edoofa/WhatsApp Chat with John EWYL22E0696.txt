26/10/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, John and parents @263776256363 @263772584882 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

That sounds like a fantastic mix of interests! Playing in soccer tournaments must be exciting. Do you have any favorite football clubs or players you admire? And regarding regular concerts, have you been to any big music events before, or are you looking forward to experiencing the music scene in India for the first time? Lastly, for athletics, are there any specific sports you're interested in trying or watching in India?

21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: ow, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Ohh okay
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Sorry but wat is an MOU
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: MOU stands for "Memorandum of Understanding." Think of it like a special agreement between two people, organizations, or groups. It's not as formal or official as a contract, but it still shows that they agree on certain things and plan to work together on something.
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 625 6363: At the moment I have no access to the internet maybe later on today

23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!

23/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Okay im now done, community building refers to establishing and strengthening relationship and shared identities among individuals within a particular group. This helps in creating a supportive environment, the goal of the project is to build a supportive, positive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility towards achieving collective success, by reaching out to personal and extended networks I should identify motivated youths who are looking forward to creating great careers and direct them towars Edoofa
