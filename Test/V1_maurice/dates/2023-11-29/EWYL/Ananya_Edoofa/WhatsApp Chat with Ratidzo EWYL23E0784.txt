25/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 835 5243: Yes am ready
25/10/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 835 5243: Yes you can continue
25/10/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/10/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 835 5243: I liked this scholarship credits
25/10/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/10/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 835 5243: Noted Thank you
25/10/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 835 5243: I will be ready for this
25/10/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
25/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 835 5243: It sounds perfect
25/10/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

17/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Ratidzo, kindly excuse me for not being able to continue our discussion, as I was engaged in an important conversation with the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana. We discussed how we can help our students acquire quality skills that will make them job-ready.

I am confident that we will generate some brilliant ideas. In the meantime, I would like you to share some unique skills you wish to learn before coming to India! We shall discuss this in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays.
17/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 835 5243: Noted thank you
22/11/23, 7:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ratidzo!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that, without my reminders, you have not attempted to connect with me on your own. I would like to highlight the importance of being regular and responsible toward your EWYL Journey.

As your mentor, I want you to earn some scholarship credits before your arrival in India. This is only possible if we finish our orientation on time, and you are dedicated to your journey. I can assure you greater achievements if you are consistent in your communication with me.
23/11/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Ratidzo!

I hope you remember that you have signed a document with your admissions team stating that you must complete your orientation sessions with me. By the way, your orientation is about to finish, and only one more session is required. After that, you will need to connect with me only twice a week.

23/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 835 5243: As for now l didn't do anything so far because contacting school authorities you need to be on ground so that someone buy my idea. I have shared with other students about Edoofa scholarship program no positive response
24/11/23, 1:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ratidzo! We shall discuss this during our session.

So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Tuesday  and Friday-  9:30 am to 11:00 am

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
