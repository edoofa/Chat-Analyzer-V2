Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

Well done on completing all the tasks and sharing this form.

05/10/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Francine,

05/10/23, 11:16 am - +260 770863622: Hello ma’am 
No I am not
05/10/23, 11:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Since one of your connections named Token Luunzwe filled up the form and shared it directly with us.
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: Oh he called me yes I remember he communicated to me today
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: I thought you meant this one the one I sent to you
05/10/23, 12:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Okay
06/10/23, 12:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Francine
How are you doing?
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 770863622: I am good and you
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 770863622: Ma’am
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: I wanted to ask about the EWYL program is it just based on the community building project
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No, There are other projects as well Francine
06/10/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Well other than the ones we know the three you made us aware what else is there
12/10/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
12/10/23, 5:25 pm - +260 770863622: Sure ma’am
12/10/23, 5:25 pm - +260 770863622: Thanks for the update
13/10/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Mark your calendars because it's that time of the week again! Our highly-anticipated *weekly call is right around the corner*, and it's happening *TOMORROW!* 🎉

🗓️ DATE: *14/10/2023, Saturday*
🕒 TIME:  4:30 (Indian Time)
📍 LINK TO THE CALL: https://meet.google.com/oyu-rgsh-igm

📢 A quick reminder: *Your attendance for this month will be marked through these engaging and insightful weekly calls.* 📈 It's a fantastic opportunity to share ideas, stay updated, and build connections with your awesome team. So please, make sure you attend, and let's make this week's call one to remember! 🤝💼

We can't wait to see you there! 👋📞🤗
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sorry for the delay Francine. So yes, apart from the three core projects, there are also external projects, but these come with specific time limits, and we haven't introduced them yet.

Moreover, when you look at the bigger picture and beyond just earning credits, you'll realize that the basic three projects help you become well-rounded. For instance, with Corporate Alliance, you get the opportunity to reach out to professionals in your industry of interest and build valuable connections. If you make the most of this opportunity, you might not need anyone else's help to secure jobs in the future. Your connections will serve that purpose.
13/10/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, the projects like Community Building and African School Education Reform Mission offer an excellent opportunity to boost your confidence and awaken your leadership qualities. When you engage with 100-200 different people, it naturally enhances your self-assuredness. Furthermore, when you communicate with headmasters, you gain valuable experience in interacting with professionals, which is a crucial skill for your future endeavors.

I am having a problem with my phone it keeps on going off
14/10/23, 6:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. Let me share the points that will help you create the video- 

*You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

23/11/23, 12:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 770863622: Hello
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 770863622: Good evening
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening, 
I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I do ma’am 
I still have the certificate 😌
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I am
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - +260 770863622: I have understood that the grant is effective in the second semester of each academic year. It is applied if you have 75% attendance for both the university and participation in the EWYL plans and other activities related to edoofa
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 770863622: I agree and appreciate that
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 770863622: True
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 

Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - +260 770863622: Thank you so much and yes I am well aware
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 770863622: I understand
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 7478618: We noted.Thank you
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 770863622: Thank you
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - +260 770863622: I will go through it Ma’am
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/11/23, 4:25 pm - +260 770863622: But they are not here so does it mean they have to send a copy of there signature or it is okay if the don’t sign
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They have to do e-signature
23/11/23, 4:40 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am

25/11/23, 1:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 5:22 pm - +260 770863622: I understood that the power of a competitive spirit is that that pushes us to go beyond our limits, to strive for greatness, and to never settle for mediocrity. When we embrace competition, we tap into our inner strength and determination. It fuels our motivation and drives us to work harder, learn from our failures, and celebrate our victories. A competitive spirit fosters growth, resilience, and a constant desire to improve. So, embrace that competitive fire within you and let it propel you towards success! 
Thank you for the information and this is what I learnt from it

27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh.

Certificates of grand rewards were allocated to the edoofians represent at that meeting
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter?

Can you recall what they were?

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.

27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago?

28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors.

28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 770863622: Yes, I do
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +260 770863622: Alright
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 770863622: Yes ma’am
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I am aware
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 770863622: I will ma’am
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 770863622: Yes
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Francine. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $1000 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $2. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - +260 770863622: Sure thing ma’am
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: Sure ma’am
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: And ma’am remember that time you said I should connect my former school to edoofa well they are already connected
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Okay
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Njase girls secondary school
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I didn't meant that you have to connect to your former school. 
It was an idea that you can start wokring on the project by reaching out to your former school.
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 770863622: Oh alright
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - +260 770863622: Well I understand that I am supposed to attained the remaining group session and calls.work on allocated tasks and work hard in my EWYL forms
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
