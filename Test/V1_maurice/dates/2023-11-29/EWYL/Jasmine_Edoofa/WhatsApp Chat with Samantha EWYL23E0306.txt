So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Samantha!
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

02/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay so the Second project of community building is the process of establishing and strengthening connections and relationships with a group of people of a community. Community building allows each and every part of the group to participate in attaining goals. It also creates a positive attitude to students and ensures that students attain their goals. The main objective of this objective is to improve networking skills as students take part in online activities as they take part in the growing of the Edoofa organisation. The student doing the project is to identify African youths who have graduated in the Senior Secondary Course,  or those who are in their final year at A level and are willing to persue their education at a higher level  and connect them with the Edoofa Program. Students  get guidance from the Edoofa team to ensure success in this project.  The  Edoofian student earns credits  through  connecting students with Edoofians, the payment of the enrollment fee by the students, and for the whole process of Administration.
02/08/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That’s awesome- Samantha, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

I hope this message finds you well and ready to conquer the day. As the sun rises on another opportunity-filled morning, *I wanted to remind you of our session scheduled for today from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m.* I'm truly looking forward to our time together, where we'll dive into exciting discussions and learning experiences.

I'm excited to connect with you and continue our journey of growth and discovery. Kindly be on time.
24/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Hello Ms Jasmine, thank you for the inspirational message. 

Im doing great  thanks how are you?
24/08/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
24/08/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
24/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Im sorry for responding late my network has been very low today.
24/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Yes im noting
24/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Yes
24/08/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.

28/08/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
28/08/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you doing?
28/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Im doing great thank you.
28/08/23, 1:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now let us continue with Project 3. When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Im noting
28/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Why is it so
28/08/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay thank you for the clarification
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Samantha- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

29/08/23, 2:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 335 7360: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 335 7360: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 335 7360: I hope you enjoyed your  festival of Rhaki
31/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 335 7360: You are welcome
31/08/23, 1:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- From now onwards you will have your sessions on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
31/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay noted... Yes im ready
31/08/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

31/08/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
31/08/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
31/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay starting from now?
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After this session dear
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
31/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay well noted

31/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Im noting
31/08/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
31/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Okay Ms Jasmine
