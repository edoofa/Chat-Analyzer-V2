I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. This is to inform you that students who come to India are offered some special benefits and now you are also one of them. _These benefits have been thoughtfully curated to alleviate the financial burden on both you and your beloved parents._

To delve into these exclusive benefits and explore the possibilities that lie ahead, I invite you to a motivational call. ☎️ This call isn't just about information; it's about empowerment. It's about seizing the opportunities that will pave the way for your success story.
*May I know if 4:00 pm (Indian Time)/ 12:30 pm (Zim Time) today is okay with you?* If not kindly let me know the time when you are available.

29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
