Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking
17/08/23, 9:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great
17/08/23, 9:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

17/08/23, 2:20 pm - +91 89681 80637: How are you?
17/08/23, 2:21 pm - +91 89681 80637: I am fine ma'am, thank you for asking
17/08/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
I hope you all are perfectly fine. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 381 4111: Evening. curewntly iam at work. Can i contribute to the discussion after work. Say 5 pm zimbabwe time
17/08/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, But till the time, I would really appreciate if Tatenda could participate in the session.
17/08/23, 2:47 pm - +91 89681 80637: Sure ma'am
17/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 381 4111: noted ma'am
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 89681 80637: Okay, so from the grant, I have understood that there are certain criteria that we  I need to abide to as a grant winner in order to be able to redeem the grant. Firstly is that, I can redeem the grant every second semester given that the grant total is more than the credits total, i.e., I have to redeem the amount, whichever is more. So, given that I redeem the grant in every second semester, it then means that I receive $250 each second semester. Then, secondly, I can only redeem either one between the grants and the credits. It is not possible to redeem both options, but rather, I can redeem the one with more amounts. Also, I can withdraw the total grant amount for a single semester and not the whole year.
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - +91 89681 80637: Yes ma'am, I am ready!
17/08/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents.

17/08/23, 3:46 pm - +91 89681 80637: Noted
17/08/23, 3:46 pm - +91 89681 80637: Sorry for the late response
17/08/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I have completed the session with the rest of the students Tatenda.
17/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 89681 80637: Ooh, sorry, ma'am, I hope you still have time to go through the discussion with me, I am ready now
17/08/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I have to wrap up for the day. I will schedule another sessions tomorrow and after that I won't take Grant discussion session.
17/08/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Make sure that you attend tomorrow's session.
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +91 89681 80637: Okay sure ma'am, noted!
17/08/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 381 4111: thank you ma'am for the session. mine just two questions which you can answer tomorrow.
1. why cant the student have both grant and scholarship credits.
2. who redeem the credits. Is it the student or edoofa official.
21/08/23, 9:31 am - +91 89681 80637: Good afternoon
21/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 381 4111: morning tatenda
21/08/23, 10:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone
I hope you all are doing fine. It is important to acknowledge that the simultaneous redemption of both scholarship credits and the Edoofa annual grant is not permissible. When an individual is eligible for both options, they must make a choice between redeeming the higher amount between their scholarship credits and the annual grant.
21/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This means that only one of these options can be utilized.
If an individual has been awarded the annual grant and also possesses
scholarship credits, they must carefully consider and select the option that
provides the greater financial benefit. It is crucial to understand that this
decision is necessary, as it is not possible to combine or redeem both the scholarship credits and the annual grant concurrently.
21/08/23, 10:51 am - +91 89681 80637: How are you?
21/08/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 560 6144: M good dear son.
21/08/23, 10:51 am - +91 89681 80637: Since it is an annual grant cant we just redeem the total grant
21/08/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 560 6144: This message was deleted
21/08/23, 10:52 am - +91 89681 80637: For a single semester?
21/08/23, 10:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Morning Mrs. Maushe
How are you doing?
21/08/23, 10:52 am - +91 89681 80637: Great
21/08/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 560 6144: I am good and you.
21/08/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me explain it to you. So you have got a 1000$ total grant, that you can use in four years with an annual grant of 250$. You cannot use the complete amount at one time. 
Since, based on your per-year performance, the grant can be increased or decreased.
21/08/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking.
21/08/23, 10:58 am - +91 89681 80637: Okay noted ma'am
21/08/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*⭐

21/08/23, 3:08 pm - +91 89681 80637: Okay noted ma'am
21/08/23, 3:08 pm - +91 89681 80637: How are you
21/08/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well Tatenda. How are you doing?
21/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 89681 80637: I am fine ma'am, thank you for asking
25/08/23, 2:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you please elaborate more on this Tatenda?
25/08/23, 4:57 pm - +91 89681 80637: Like the idea that when I redeem the grant or the credits, the credits amount is reset to zero. I was hoping the system could be a bit fair and not reset the credits but rather store them for another semester
29/08/23, 10:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda, 
I hope you are doing well. I think there is some sort of confusion and let me clear that out. 
The Scholarship credits won't be reset to zero. For example, When you are supposed to pay your fee in your second semester, you will have two options. Either you can use your grant amount or the scholarship credits, whichever will be higher. 
Now, for example, if your grant amount is higher then you will use your grant, and scholarship credits will remain the same and will not go back to zero.
29/08/23, 10:55 am - +91 89681 80637: Ooh okay okay noted ma'am, I had a misconception on the issue. Thank you for clearing that up
29/08/23, 10:55 am - +91 89681 80637: How are you today
29/08/23, 11:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well Tatenda. Now I want you to sign the Grant document and share it with me.
29/08/23, 11:17 am - +91 89681 80637: Okay ma'am let me do as so
29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - +91 89681 80637: Thank you ma'am
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - +91 89681 80637: Have a happy holiday
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - +91 89681 80637: That is great. I hope to enjoy the day as well
31/08/23, 7:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning*, 
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for all the wishes. It was a very lovely day yesterday and I celebrated Rakhi with my family members. 
Now, I would like to tell you that it has been quite some days since I have shared the Grant Letter with you. Now if you have accepted the grant, then kindly share the signed document with me otherwise you will not be considered for the *EDOOFA GRANT*. 

Kindly acknowledge this message and let me know if you have accepted the grant or not.

I am Tatenda Maushe, a fellow proud Edoofian who has had the opportunity to study at LOVELY PROFFESSIONAL UNIVERSITY, one of the finest colleges in India. As I am following  my path to greatness, I have also started venturing into self enhancing programs that enable me to pickup various helpful skills like Debate. In this venture I have managed to scope two prices, first was the first position in the Debate Spectra Competition which I won with my colleague Munyaradzi Chokutamba due to our outstanding performance and great confidence execution. Through clear demonstration of passion, hard work, collaboration and perseverance, I managed to move forward to another very difficult competition  were I managed to be a second runner up and won a trophy which will forever remind me  of my dedication and the fruits of my hard work. My message to all Edoofians is that we all need to work hard with great passion and dedication in order to realize our true potential in our lives.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.

27/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge, that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $250 annually. 
Do you remember this? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am, i recall
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent Tatenda, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 98760 65081: I still remember the guidelines
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 98760 65081: 1. I can redeem credits or grant depending on whichever amount is higher.
2. 75% attendance in university
3. University fee paid within timeline.
4.75% attendance of EWYL .
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 98760 65081: I can redeem whichever amount is higher between the credits and the grant
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me also elaborate
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 98760 65081: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 98760 65081: null
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Tatenda, are you trying to call me?
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 98760 65081: sorry ma'am, my phone isn't responding properly
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am, I am aware

27/11/23, 4:35 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

27/11/23, 4:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - +91 98760 65081: Noted ma'am

27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great, but your attendance in webinar is not good.
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - +91 98760 65081: Most webinars I could not attend because of the MOOC courses which I used to attend online after lectures every workday at 6pm til 7pm so mostly clashed with the Webinar times
27/11/23, 5:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Tatenda, Webinar happens only once in 15 days. 
Are you saying that you can't take out one hours in two weeks?
27/11/23, 5:05 pm - +91 98760 65081: I also attended the last webinar ma'am, making them 3 in total from september
27/11/23, 5:06 pm - +91 98760 65081: I failed to attend the second from the last one because of my device, that's when I had changed my number
27/11/23, 5:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For how long did you attend it?
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - +91 98760 65081: Until the end ma'am
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - +91 98760 65081: I did not have my camera on only
27/11/23, 5:11 pm - +91 98760 65081: When we were discussing about self branding on the Resume
27/11/23, 5:11 pm - +91 98760 65081: How to have an exceptional CV
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - +91 98760 65081: And also how to showcase excellent working like sportsmanship
27/11/23, 5:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This is only for September and October Tatenda
27/11/23, 5:14 pm - +91 98760 65081: Okay, I'm not sure I remember entirely all the webinars
27/11/23, 5:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In September and October also?
27/11/23, 5:15 pm - +91 98760 65081: I remember the one when we had a speaker from Nigeria
27/11/23, 5:15 pm - +91 98760 65081: Okay okay ma'am
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - +91 98760 65081: Okay noted ma'am
27/11/23, 5:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 5:19 pm - +91 98760 65081: Ma'am, I wanted to inform you that I signed the student's representative form with Nicassio
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, That was the training of 300$ Tatenda.
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - +91 98760 65081: Okay noted ma'am
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - +91 98760 65081: So I can redeem the credits of $252.00 for the second semester!
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - +91 98760 65081: Okay how do I go about it
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - +91 98760 65081: Noted ma'am, i will be sure to take it as a challenge in order to make my performance the best as well
27/11/23, 5:24 pm - +91 98760 65081: Sure ma'am, that is great for me to focus more on greater performance
27/11/23, 5:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - +91 98760 65081: Yes ma'am, I understand
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
27/11/23, 5:27 pm - +91 98760 65081: I will surely make you proud from this month onwards because after each webinar I will be coming back to you with feedback
27/11/23, 5:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That will be great Tatenda
27/11/23, 5:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents to the fullest_
