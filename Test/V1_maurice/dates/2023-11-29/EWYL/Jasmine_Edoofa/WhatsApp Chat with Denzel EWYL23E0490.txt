14/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes @918982519022
14/08/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 636 6773: To execute Community Building project i have to create a WhatsApp group and identify the proper  and right students who can be part of the group,to find the right students,i can get intouch with my school mates who are already in A level or those who finished their A level.

In this group i will share information about Edoofa stating it's advantages and benefits.The group should have a minimum of 60 students and i should add my EWYL mentor in the group also.

Right information should only be shared in the group
14/08/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Denzel, I am impressed with your understanding.
14/08/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
14/08/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

15/08/23, 12:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

Can we start our session?

16/08/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
Are you ready for the session?
16/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess i am
16/08/23, 1:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job Denzel. Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
16/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes i am 100% sure
16/08/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Oky i get it
16/08/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes i am
16/08/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

16/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 636 6773: I get it
16/08/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.


The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

17/08/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

21/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 619 9320: Facing new challenges is an essential part of personal and professional growth.

Last year around March when i was doing my lower six studies,things got a little tense.I was facing time management , financial and socialisation challenges.I would go to school but at the end of the day  i felt as if i were not part of the school.

I felt being discriminated   since most of the students were from the same  schools and were already friends.In the class i would sit alone with no one to talk to.

This made my first days at Chinhoyi 2 High School very tough.I felt som much pressure from my studies since i had no one to assist  me or discuss with me.

I started having a mind to dropout of high school.Then it came a time when  i told my parents and they  told me everything was gonna be alright.

One day i went to visit the Senior Teacher and told me i wanted to create a Social club names CSC (Creativity and Socialisation Club)

I explained to him the aims of the club ( to create a social network between students so that everybody could feel appreciated ).

He agreed and i as the President of the club went to the classroom  and i introduced it to my classmates.

Everyone was told to gather at the assembly and they had to vote for the Club Board.

I could see the happiness  among other students and thus really helped me a lot.

It helped me developed n strong connection and with other students.
