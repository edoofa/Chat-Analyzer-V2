14/02/23, 8:31 am - You were added
10/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. May I know when Elton will be continuing with the Earn While You Learn Program?
10/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Good day. Elton is still at school they did not come back home this school holiday. They are now preparing  for their final exams. This means he will be available after his final exams in November. Thank you so much for checking on him
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - +263 73 341 6709: Good morning. Elton is away at boarding school in another town and they are not allowed to carry phones there. We really appreciate your concern. Thank you so much. 

Regards 

Primrose Shumba (Elton's mother)
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 73 341 6709: Option 1 is the only one workable because Elton is out of reach until November
15/09/23, 9:49 am - +263 73 341 6709: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 1:30pm to 2:30 pm
18/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Good afternoon. Sorry I was caught up in a meeting at work.  We are done now
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Thank you. I'm downloading it
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can watch the vidoe after the session. Let us proceed
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 73 341 6709: No ma'am. May you shed light on that.
18/09/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Elton is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 73 341 6709: This is clear. Thank you
18/09/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Very clear ma'am. Thank you
18/09/23, 3:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Thank you ma'am. Noted
18/09/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Noted ma'am. Thank you
19/09/23, 11:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Good afternoon Ma'am. I'm sorry I was tied up at work
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Greetings. We are doing fine. Thank you
20/09/23, 1:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Elton to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Noted but Elton can not connect. He is at a boarding school where phones are not allowed. Will it be too late if we wait for him. He will be done with his final exams in November and by then he will be home. He will fully tackle his EWYL activities. Thank you
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After he is back, please share this with Elton.
20/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Noted. Thank you
20/09/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now it is time to wrap up for today. 
It was lovely talking to you.
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Thank you. Good day
05/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Good evening. Yes we can move on
06/10/23, 1:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
06/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Yes we can continue
06/10/23, 1:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So Elton how are you doing?
06/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 73 341 6709: The parents are fine and we pray Elton is also fine at school where he is
06/10/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So I am talking to Elton's parents. Well I am happy to know that you are doing fine.
06/10/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Elton’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Thank you. That's very relieving
06/10/23, 1:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 73 341 6709: It's okay
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Have a lovely day ahead!
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
12/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 73 341 6709: Yes we can
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 73 341 6709: I would want to believe this is for Elton himself not us as parents Sir. Am I correct?
12/10/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
12/10/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if is Elton available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 73 341 6709: No he is not available
12/10/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Elton to me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

I trust you all are doing well. I know your child is currently focused on school and exams, and you've formally paused the sessions. However, I want to ensure that you stay connected with the community's progress, and that's why _*I'm willing to share the newsletter from the past week.*_ 📰

*To facilitate this, we've devised a timetable where I'll be sharing updates and content with you once a week*. In return, I kindly request that you acknowledge and provide your feedback. May I know if is it clear? 
Please feel free to discuss.
