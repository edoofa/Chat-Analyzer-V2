How are you doing?
25/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 508 6191: I'm good how are you
25/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 508 6191: Firstly you look at the nature of the company which should be student centric or recreational
b) the scale of the company should neither be  too big or too small
c) financial stability companies selected must be financially sound
d) background of the founder companies with a founder with great experience and qualifications is a good one
One can use platforms like Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook to find the above there are certain steps which must be taken into consideration which are below:
1 searching for Google _search for start up news
Step2:after getting an image about the nature of a certain company then start studying a little more about the company and its functioning
Step3:studying the website of the company check if it's functioning properly and get an insight on how it functions
Step 4:check various social media pages of the company :Facebook, Twitter etc this can give an idea amd functioning status of the company and an active one would always post on its pages
Step5:understand and study the background of the founder and its core members to get an insight about their accomplishments
Step 6: start reaching to the people associated with the company by dropping invitation notes and connection requests always prefer to reach marketing managers, community managers
By following those steps this helps in seeking the right type of company in a systematic and efficient manner
25/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 508 6191: This is the summary from what I understood after going through the booklet

29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

One can start by reaching to his immediate network which is the family, friends, neighbour's, who who work in the service sector and u can explain to them your objectivities and how edoofa is helping you to develop necessary skills for future employment after graduation. To further expand your network there's the linkledn platform which helps in connecting with human resource managers, head of managers initiating their conversations and gathering their contact information to set up calls with edoofa  and one has to share the information with the edoofa team which will be easier for them to discuss the business cooperative aspect of this alliance. And the document with different questions is going to be shared with questions such as how to initiate conversations with influential individuals. Creating a LinkedIn account will not increase one's personal network but also enhance credibility and chances of gaining enternships and even financial opportunities to your country

08/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 508 6191: Oky
08/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 508 6191: This message was deleted
08/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear, you don't have to fill up the form. 
You have to share it with other students and they will fill up the form.
08/09/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 508 6191: Sorry Maam that was sent by mistake I had noticed Earlier
08/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No worries. _Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 508 6191: Oky
08/09/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Tiara?
08/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 508 6191: Yes ma'am
08/09/23, 9:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
08/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 508 6191: One has to create a whatsaap group and identify the right students as participants the main goal is to enlighten students about edoofa and its effectiveness this can be done through starting with your classmates. You can create an unofficial whatsaap group and be added then later create a group with a catchy line such as those who are looking for the opportunity for broad education join my group the main reason of creating this group is for getting in touch with large audience using less energy you have to start sharing information with them about the exciting opportunity of learn India and you as my mentor should be added in the group to ensure that the right information is spread
08/09/23, 10:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Tiara, I am impressed with your understanding. 

While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
08/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 508 6191: Ok
08/09/23, 10:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
08/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 508 6191: Oky so ma'am am I supposed to send the offline form in my group and after I have sent it the students after filling out the application form whom will they give

26/09/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 528 9514: That's fine we  can prooced
26/09/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing project 3. Do you remember?
26/09/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 528 9514: Sure Ma'am i remember.
26/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
26/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 528 9514: Lyndel House College is the School name. Located in Harare province. For now my school is not yet connected with Edoofa program, bt some few friends at my school want to be connected soon. As for the message to use when approaching the school authorities. I introduced myself first and share with them how did i get the scholarship. And also let them know and understand my aspirations.
26/09/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 528 9514: Much agree Ma'am. And it's my mandate to make sure i have to do that.
26/09/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 528 9514: Okay Ma'am i will definitely do.
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So Tiara let us end our session here. Before I go I want you to find your headmasters contact number and keep it with you.
26/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 528 9514: Definitely i will.
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So have a nice day ahead!
26/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 528 9514: Same to you Ma'am. Thank you.
28/09/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I hope you are doing well. It's time for the session. Are you ready?
28/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 528 9514: Yes Ma'am we can  proceed
28/09/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember?
28/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 528 9514: Sure Ma'am
28/09/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
28/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 528 9514: That's fine Ma'am. For now i have my Principal's. Do you mind if i can supply?
28/09/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. First let me explain the complete project and then you can start working with the number
28/09/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 528 9514: Go ahead Ma'am
28/09/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].
28/09/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
28/09/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 528 9514: Will check up with my school schedules and will give the constant date and time tomorrow. I don't know if you will be available on this platform tomorrow.
28/09/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Tiara, dear this is the message that you should use while reaching out to the headmaster

*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
29/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 528 9514: Ok
29/09/23, 9:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
29/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 528 9514: If I may ask why ma'am
29/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
29/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
29/09/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 528 9514: OK ma'am I wanted to understand because most of the local schools in my area they pay fee's around 60-80 dollars per term especially government institutions
29/09/23, 9:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So you can do one thing. You can start your project by working with these schools. As you must be aware school fees increased rapidly due to inflation. So once the school fees go beyond 100$, we will reach out to them and then start the process. 
How does that sound?
29/09/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 528 9514: Yea that sound's great but I'm certain in my local area  my school is a Private and other two institutions other's are local government schools and their price of school fee's don't rise beyond 80 dollars
29/09/23, 9:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, You can start with them and in 6-12 months, their fees will go beyond 100$. We will reach out to them. Till the time, you can start with the Community Building.
29/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 528 9514: Okay
29/09/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:
29/09/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on
MONDAY and THURSDAY
29/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 528 9514: OK ma'am
29/09/23, 4:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
29/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Glad to know that Ma'am. Enjoy your holiday. It's good to know and remember our heroes.
03/10/23, 8:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Tiara*
I hope you are in great spirits. Finally, it's time to resume our session after such a long weekend. I am sure you will be as excited as I am. _*So, I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled with me for today from 8:30 am onwards.*_

03/10/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am great Tiara. Thank you for asking. Before I start Tiara, I would like to you tell me that are you 100% available for the session because I don't want you to get distracted for the next 60 minutes.
03/10/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 528 9514: Quite available Ma'am. If not
03/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 528 9514: If network didn't destruct us
03/10/23, 8:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's hope that we can have a smooth session. So last time we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 528 9514: Sure Ma'am
03/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Tiara- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
03/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 528 9514: So far so good. As i  understand it's now my duty as an edoofian to take part in the project. Since its now my duty to take part by introducing and give full knowledge of Edoofa program to my local schools. And connect them in the program. It's only that some part of the project is not yet fulfilled. Like some of the schools didn't reach the speculated fee charge required by the program. Of which i don't think it may affect my project.
03/10/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I am happy to hear your understanding.
03/10/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:

FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on
MONDAY and THURSDAY
03/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 528 9514: That one noted
03/10/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

03/10/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
03/10/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
03/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 528 9514: Very important to know. If i may Start now. I am a proud Edoofian.

Of which i will try to assist  her with mine so that she will be able to attend sessions with you. At the same time i  am busy trying to full fill my university addimision which has some arrears. But otherwise we are doing very well with family. I repeat thank you so much for be our caring mentor.

I'm curious about how Tiara plans to attend the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN sessions. It's essential to ensure she has a reliable means of connection. If you could provide some insights into her situation, we can explore potential solutions together.
