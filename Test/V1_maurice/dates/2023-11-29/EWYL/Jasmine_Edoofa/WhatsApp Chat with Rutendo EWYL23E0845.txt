02/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 391 8367 joined using this group's invite link
02/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Dear Mentor, my name is Rutendo Violet Manuhwa, and my EWYL group name is Rutendo EWYL23E0845. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 03/11/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
03/11/23, 8:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning Rutendo*_
My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 03-11-2023 from *8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
03/11/23, 8:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/11/23, 8:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Rutendo, I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

_Link of the group_: *https://chat.whatsapp.com/GIR7CXtn7wn6RRMKXEfuGB*
03/11/23, 8:12 am - +263 77 391 8367: It's a pleasure to meet Ms Jasmine.
03/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 391 8367: I'm sorry Rutendo cannot join us at the moment she is engaged with exams.She can only be available after the 17th of November
03/11/23, 8:16 am - +263 77 391 8367: I'm her mother and yes 0830 hrs is fine
03/11/23, 8:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Ideally, our initial orientation involves a comprehensive discussion with students about the mission and vision of the EWYL PROGRAM, followed by a detailed discussion of the various projects. 

However, since Rutendo is not available for morning sessions, we will conduct a brief orientation with you. We will provide you with an overview of the program during this short session. We kindly request that you share this information with Rutendo or ask her to review the conversation at her earliest convenience. Our full initial orientation process typically spans 2-3 days. May I know if will you be able to attend the session for the next 3 days?
03/11/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 391 8367: I will be able to attend but as of Rutendo she can only attend after the 17th
03/11/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, No problem. I would love to utilise this moment to know more about you.
03/11/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
03/11/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 391 8367: There isn't much to know.Im 41 ,a mother of 4 children Rutendo being the first.I did my A levels and am currently a stay home mum.
03/11/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It's a pleasure to connect with you and I am sure that we will get to know each other better during this journey.
03/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 391 8367: Nice to know you
03/11/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 391 8367: Enlighten me
03/11/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Rutendo is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
03/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
03/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 391 8367: That is lovely
03/11/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
03/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 391 8367: That will be helpful
03/11/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 391 8367: Nice to meet you Ms Sanjana.Im Rutendos mother
03/11/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
03/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
03/11/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
03/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
03/11/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
03/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 391 8367: Will I be able to execute the activity since Rutendo isn't around or it requires Rutendo herself.
03/11/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I'm simply providing you with an overview of the curriculum. When she returns, you can then go over it with her, correct?
03/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
03/11/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
03/11/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 391 8367: That's inspiring
03/11/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Rutendo’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
03/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
03/11/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
03/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 391 8367: Sure
03/11/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options. First of all, I would like to know if is Rutendo available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
03/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 391 8367: As of now she won't be available until after the 17th of November.
03/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 391 8367: I,the mother am the only one available for now
03/11/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Then, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Rutendo to me stating that:

Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - ewyl@edoofa.com, and jasmine.edoofa@gmail.com, sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com.

 Once you are done, kindly let me know so that I can confirm.
03/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
03/11/23, 9:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Once done kindly let me know.
03/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 391 8367: I have sent
03/11/23, 10:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I have received your mail.
03/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
03/11/23, 10:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that the email has been sent, I'd like to reiterate a key point. *Since Rutendo won't be available for the sessions until November 17th, I've completed the initial orientation with you* Now, there are two options: either you can explain things to Rutendo when she returns, or she can go through the messages in the group for the information.

As the initial orientation is complete, there is a process where we temporarily pause the sessions until Rutendo is back. Once her exams are finished, we'll resume our sessions.Kindly notify me when she's ready to continue. 
May I know that are we on the same page?
03/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 391 8367: Yes ma'am
03/11/23, 10:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, It was lovely talking to you. 
Have a great day ahead!
03/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you dear,and the same to you
07/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes it is clear
17/11/23, 8:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Greetings Rutendo and parents!_* 
Hope you are doing well.

24/11/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting on a daily basis here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 8:30 am in the morning in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!

27/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 956 9902: So far as per my understanding there have been sessions to secure a scholarship and to get a review on who's getting it thus the need of a mentor through the process. My parents had been undergoing them and now i have to take over
27/11/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the entire conversation Rutendo?

27/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
