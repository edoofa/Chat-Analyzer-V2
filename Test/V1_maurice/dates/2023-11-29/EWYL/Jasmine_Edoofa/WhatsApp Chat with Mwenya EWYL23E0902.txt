My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as Ms. Jasmine. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 28-11-2023 from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
