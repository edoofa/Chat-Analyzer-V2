20/10/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
21/10/23, 11:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Tanaka and parents!
How are you?
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will commence our sessions starting from Wednesday onward. 😊 Please note that I won't be available on Monday due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: While Dussehra is a unique and culturally significant Indian festival, it can be related to the spirit of celebration and community found in many festivals around the world, including Zimbabwe. 🎉 Zimbabwe has its own rich tapestry of festivals, such as the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) and traditional celebrations like the Harare Agricultural Show. 🎪🌾 These festivals, like Dussehra, bring people together in a spirit of unity and celebration, fostering a sense of togetherness and cultural pride. 🤝

08/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 078 1078: Everyday for how long ?
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Just one time in the morning

09/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
