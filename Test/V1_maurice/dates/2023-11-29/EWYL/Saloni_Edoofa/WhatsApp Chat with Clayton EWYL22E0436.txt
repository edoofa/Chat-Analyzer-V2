I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects on the *EWYL Line only*

14/09/23, 1:52 pm - +91 92891 43211: I'm doing well, how are you?

14/09/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Clayton, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from your home country, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to your University in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
14/09/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience
14/09/23, 4:12 pm - +91 92891 43211: Okay, let me get to it. I'll send it as soon as I'm done.
15/09/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Clayton!
How are you?

15/09/23, 3:47 pm - +91 92891 43211: Greetings of the day.
15/09/23, 3:49 pm - +91 92891 43211: My understanding is that the $300 plan is an opportunity presented by the Edoofa program to us, so that we can get more benefits from the community building project. In this plan, scholarship credots of $100 will be awarded when a student gets enrolled into the Edoofa Scholarship Program and pays the partial enrollment fee of $200. When the remaining amount has been paid, another $100 is awarded. The last $100 will be awarded when the student pays the registration fee for the university in which they would have been accepted into.

15/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
