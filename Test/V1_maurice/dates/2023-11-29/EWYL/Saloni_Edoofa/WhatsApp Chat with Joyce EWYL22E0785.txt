15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 6:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
27/11/23, 8:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Joyce!

Exciting news – the eagerly awaited discussion on the *Grant 2023* guidelines to discuss your performance and eligibility, is finally here! *Today*, we invite you and your parents to join the session from *06:00 - 07:00 PM Indian Time or 02:30 - 03:30 PM CAT.* Your presence will be precious 🤝
27/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 71 931 7599: OK maam will attend thank you
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Evening maam
27/11/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
27/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually.
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Joyce, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Participate in all assignments you are given.
Be a good student all the times.
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 931 7599: These are a few l am recalling
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, that are the attributes of a proud edoofian.
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 931 7599: OK maam
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Maam sofar do l have any scholarship credits
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will share that soon.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam thank you
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam l have heard it all
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Maam l attended 2 more Webinars using Gains phone and Mr Rithivk said he was going to update to on that when he used to visit our campus
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you share your understanding with me post these webinars?
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 931 7599: I'm sorry maam l didn't update you on that
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that!
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 931 7599: OK maam will work hard
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam l am ready to do so
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that Joyce would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam l am hearing you well
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 931 7599: I am going to work hard
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam l will do so .
I really want to work hard
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 931 7599: I have to attend all meetings  and activities all the time
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Working hard in finding forms for students who want to study in India and they are really serious to come
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great Joyce, I know you will be able to do that.
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam thank you
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
27/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Joyce, anything you wish to say?
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 931 7599: No maam l have understand anything
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 931 7599: Yes maam
28/11/23, 4:44 am - +263 71 931 7599: <Media omitted>
