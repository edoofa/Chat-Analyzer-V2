22/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 341 4960: Thank you maam
22/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 341 4960: I too feel the same way...

22/08/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
22/08/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 341 4960: Yes indeed
22/08/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 341 4960: I'll share right away

How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
23/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 530 8270: Good Morning
23/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 530 8270: Sure let's begin
23/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay, got an urgent call.
23/08/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Emmanuel, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 530 8270: It's ok
23/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 530 8270: Um ok
23/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 530 8270: So I wanna be a successful journalist who has principles 
I want to make my work to be noticed
I wanna be someone who is a living example 

The EWYL Programme will help me in being hard working and time managing and this will help me in the future. Also it will help me in  being someone who utilises what has been provided
23/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 341 4960: Following
23/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that and I promise to work hard along with you so that you can achieve all your dreams.
23/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 530 8270: I'm not sure...can you share them
23/08/23, 8:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 8:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 530 8270: Noted
Thank you for the clarity
23/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 530 8270: I noted how EWYL Programme has helped the student with credits and also the advantages as well tha nks
23/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, and I promise that together we will achieve milestones even higher and earn many credits.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 530 8270: I hope so ma'am
23/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 530 8270: Thank you

How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
29/08/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I'll see you on *Thursday* from 08:30-09:30 AM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Goodafternoon.

31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 530 8270: That's nice 🩵🩵🩵
31/08/23, 8:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much!

31/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 530 8270: How are you ma'am
31/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, I will help you know all of these once, do not worry!
31/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 341 4960: Wow im glad the family had. Good time its nice to celebrate siblings

31/08/23, 8:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, not exactly I am an artist but yes, I have my interest strongly drawn towards it. <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 530 8270: I am myself 😄
31/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you told me but you did not share your art work with me, why is that?
31/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 530 8270: I don't have a copyright yet and I fear plagiarism
31/08/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, it is completely alright!
31/08/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
31/08/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
31/08/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will discuss it tomorrow for sure!
31/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Ok good day
01/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 530 8270: Hello
01/09/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

I am extremely sorry for the delay, I had an urgent meeting that extended for a longer time than expected. 
But I am going to share an amazing '*_Do you know?_* shared on Edoofa's Instagram page. It is really interesting. Do go through it and let me know your answer in the comment box🤔

01/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 341 4960: Goodmorning emmanuel willl be going back to school next week and time will be limited
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
01/09/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

07/10/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Emmanuel can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?

How are you?
14/10/23, 7:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
14/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 341 4960: How are you ma'am  yes we would love to continue with the program. The big challenge is at school the network has been low and emmanuel is failing to be reqchable on time however he said he can respond better in the evening so he will respond later when zesa comes back.as for me im okay with anything

16/10/23, 7:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: I can completely understand that and no need to worry, you are just left with some basic formalities towards your program now.
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/10/23, 7:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

26/10/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning *our proud edoofian and parents*🌟
How are you doing?

This week in India we celebrated _Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami_, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It signifies the *victory of good over evil* and marks the end of the nine-day Navaratri festival. Dussehra honors the legend of *Lord Rama's triumph over the demon king Ravana*👺, symbolizing the victory of righteousness and truth. It is celebrated with grand processions, cultural events, and the burning of effigies of Ravana, signifying the defeat of negativity. Dussehra also emphasizes the importance of moral values and the need to stand up against injustice, making it a significant cultural celebration in India.🇮🇳
26/10/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra, although not originally linked to Zambia, has found relevance in the country through the Indian diaspora. Zambia is a country with a rich tapestry of cultures and traditions, which is reflected in the variety of festivals celebrated throughout the year. Among the most prominent is *Independence Day,* commemorating Zambia's independence from British colonial rule on October 24th. *Labour Day* on May 1st is also celebrated with parades and events to honor the country's workers. Additionally, Agricultural Shows are held across the country, showcasing Zambia's agricultural heritage. Various ethnic groups in Zambia, such as the Bemba, Tonga, and Ngoni, celebrate their own cultural festivals, including ceremonies and rituals that highlight their unique heritage.
26/10/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *So tell me, what are your thoughts on these similarities🫱🏻‍🫲🏼?*
26/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 895 9334: Wow🔥🔥🔥
27/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!

That is great, I am so delighted to have your views on it🌟
I think Zimbabwe and India, despite their geographical and cultural differences, share certain similarities in their festive traditions. Both countries celebrate major festivals with vibrant colors, music, and a strong sense of community. Both nations also celebrate various agricultural festivals, reflecting the importance of farming in their societies. Additionally, the idea of family and community bonding is central to both countries' celebrations, emphasizing the significance of togetherness during these festive occasions.
01/11/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, esteemed and proud Edoofians parents!

18/11/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you follow the daily ritual, please do let me know.
20/11/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Emmanuel,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

27/11/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you have to send it to them
27/11/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 895 9334: Oh ok now I understand
27/11/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 895 9334: Oh ok
27/11/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Emmanuel/Saloni/27NOV2023*
27/11/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 895 9334: Ok I understand 
This is exciting
27/11/23, 10:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have understood from this process?
27/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 895 9334: That I should create a group of students of Alevel and enlighten them about the great opportunities that awaits for them through the Edoofa Scholarship programme.
27/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, all the students who are currently in Form 6 and Form 5.
27/11/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 895 9334: Oh ok noted
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
28/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

28/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
28/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
