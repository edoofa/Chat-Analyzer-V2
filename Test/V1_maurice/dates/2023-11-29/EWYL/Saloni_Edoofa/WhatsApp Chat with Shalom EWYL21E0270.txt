I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆

15/11/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know how are you reaching out to new students?
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Yes ma'am I do remember
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Shalom, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 686 7482: One was supposed to have a minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 686 7482: I only remember this ma'am
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is correct!
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

28/11/23, 3:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Well understood
28/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Following ma'am
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Yes ma'am I do believe and am ready
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.
Thank you for joining in!
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Noted with thanks ma'am
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our weekly EWYL Group session?
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Noted with thanks ma'am
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, one main reason of you not being eligible is you not paying your fees. May I know when will you be able to do that?
28/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Currently my dad is not working in town he went for a training and they are expected to come back in the second week of December (he's a police officer) that is delaying him to settle the remaining fees ma'am. They are not allowed to use cellphones so our communication with him is very very difficult and limited
28/11/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that Shalom and you know I see you attending all your sessions with me and it was strange to see you not eligible🥺
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I just want to buck up your shoes Shalom for the $ 300 plan, this is an open ground for you to earn. See my student earning so many credits, and yes, there is no limit to this👇🏼
