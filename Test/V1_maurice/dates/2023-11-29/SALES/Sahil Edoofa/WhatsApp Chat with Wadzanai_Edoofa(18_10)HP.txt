19/10/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Well received, Wadzanai, I am glad you had a thorough discussion, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/10/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
19/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 617 6748: If l may ask ,l don't understand what you mean about   about offering 50-100%scholarships on tuition

19/10/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss the details as we proceed.
19/10/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
19/10/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
19/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 617 6748: Okay
19/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 617 6748: Yes

23/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 398 4777: As yu can see now am seeing you message #1252 bt written around 9,29 in the morning,that where the challenge of network is in our country
23/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Afternoon ,we can
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know more about you, Mr Francis.
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 398 4777: To what extent do scholarships make education affordable for the students
23/10/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: We shall discuss the finances thoroughly in the discussion, Mr Francis.
23/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Okay
23/10/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling our discussion for *Wednesday at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours for the day are over.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.

25/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 617 6748: About the financial aspect l got to know that the scholarship will help to reduce  the cost and expenses of higher education in lndia (the costs are reduced to 2000-3000/year)

25/10/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand your concerns as a parent, Mr Jongwe.

Be informed that we provide scholarship on tuition fee itself, so the air ticket expenses are paid by the parents,

However since that is to be done next year in August, you can plan and prepare accordingly.

The air tickets are between $300-450
25/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Ok
25/10/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others.

25/10/23, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: Now having 2000 students under the program, this happened because of their trust, having known the situation of how common scams are in Zimbabwe, I completely understand your situation.

Do note that you would be connected with associates as well.

25/10/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
25/10/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Wadzanai, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
25/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Okay 

If l may ask how many points per subject do you do you consider a pass

30/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 617 6748: It's good to know more about lndia
30/10/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Wadzanai!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
30/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
30/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Wadzanai, The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/10/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/10/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2700-$3700 per year as Bachelor in planning is a niche course and not many universities offer scholarship for the same. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/10/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2700-3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same? <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Would you please tell me more about the Earn While You Learn Program
30/10/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Surely Wadzanai
30/10/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/10/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/10/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

30/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Thank you very much l will go through this thoroughly,lm up for a lesson please
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: By when would you be able to continue?
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 617 6748: I will be free by 1730 p
30/10/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, meanwhile have you followed the discussion?

If so, you can also request your father to continue.
30/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Okay please
30/10/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/10/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion Mr Jongwe?

@263713984777
30/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Yes l have Ms Harmehak
30/10/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great

So Mr Jongwe, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The same would end in 20 minutes itself,

Are you ready?
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 617 6748: I am back Ms Harmehak ,we may continue
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Am following where l have questions l Will do so
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Wadzanai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
30/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 617 6748: I'm following
30/10/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Please?
30/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Abt $1500-$2250
30/10/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/10/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/10/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Wadzanai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Indeed it is
30/10/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
30/10/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/10/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed, Wadzanai?
30/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
30/10/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
30/10/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
30/10/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l do
30/10/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/10/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

30/10/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
31/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
31/10/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
31/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 617 6748: It all went well and my questions were effectively addressed
31/10/23, 11:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
31/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 617 6748: I have not got any response from her side as of now please
31/10/23, 12:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you message her or call her ?

31/10/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do it now .
31/10/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
31/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Okay
31/10/23, 12:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
31/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Not as of now
31/10/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!
31/10/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 2:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
31/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 617 6748: 1)Bachelor of planning
2)lndia
3)$6000-$8000

5)$350
6)In 7 days
7)Not really clear on that one
31/10/23, 2:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what is not clear in question 7 ?
31/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 617 6748: The fact that the registration fee would be adjusted in my first year's annual fee
31/10/23, 2:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through this ?
31/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Does that  mean the registration fee will be paid from  my first year's fee
31/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 617 6748: My first annual fee also includes the registration fee
31/10/23, 3:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes it will be adjusted in your annual fees so nothing you are paying extra
31/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Would you please rewrite  that statement for me
31/10/23, 3:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which statement ?
31/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 617 6748: This one
31/10/23, 3:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
31/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Okay l have understood thank you

31/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 617 6748: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Parents have to acknowledge this using voice notes

31/10/23, 8:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 617 6748: According to my timetable l will be available by 1230Pm
01/11/23, 10:10 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
01/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 617 6748: I am doing well thank you
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th November 2023 for $200 and the 6th or 7th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
01/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 398 4777: As yu said, Zim financial issues are in great shumbles,bt as a parent l would try to meet my daughter's dreams thereby l would opt for option 1, if she happen to qualify
01/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answer using voice notes ?
01/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 398 4777: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Wadzanai's application.

01/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes please

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
03/11/23, 9:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Thank you very much
04/11/23, 11:44 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
Please excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the board
Shall we start the session?
04/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes please
06/11/23, 11:43 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning,

I hope your weekend provided you with the opportunity to rejuvenate. Are you ready to continue our session for today?
06/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l am
06/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family manage to go through your acceptance letter ?
06/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes we did
06/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
06/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 617 6748: I want to know about the bank charges
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 398 4777: Yes ,have gone thru ,
06/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 617 6748: Yes please
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
