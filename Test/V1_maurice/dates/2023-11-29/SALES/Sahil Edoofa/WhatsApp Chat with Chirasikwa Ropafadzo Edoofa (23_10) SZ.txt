01/11/23, 12:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. Ropafadzo mentioned that she has an affinity towards Engineering. Can you please brief me regarding her career aspirations more vividly?
01/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 74 513 3207: She has been talking about being an engineer one day eversince she was still in primary. And up to now she has never changed. Even if you check on her subjects combination it's all about engineering. She likes that profession
01/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is truly inspiring, Mr. Claude! Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues Ropafadzo?
01/11/23, 1:56 pm - +27 74 513 3207: She was talking about civil engineering, mechanical engineering
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. May I know which field intrigues her more, please?
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Mechanical engineering
01/11/23, 3:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. May I know what drew her towards this peculiar domain, please?
01/11/23, 3:50 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think it's because she discovered that she is very good in sciences
01/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mr. Claude, could you please share why Ropafadzo didn't pursue Chemistry in her A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
01/11/23, 4:14 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes, it's a very crucial science subject. But she was saying they were given the subjects combinations to choose from, so since she liked mathematics to be in her combination so there was no chemistry in that combination with maths
01/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
01/11/23, 4:35 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Okay. If I may ask besides mechanical engineering and civil engineering, what other engineering courses do you offer. Or let me put it this way, with her doing Mathematics, Physics and Geography, what engineering course can she qualifies to?
01/11/23, 4:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Claude. Since the Engineering Sector is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Engineering Sector to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Ropafadzo's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
01/11/23, 4:47 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Thanks very much. She was offline Ropafadzo. She is saying she applied for mining engineering
01/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. May I know what piques her interest in Mining, please?
01/11/23, 6:22 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Okay, like I said before that Ropafadzo was always interested in doing anything engineering. But for her to go for mining engineering I think it was from her uncle who is working as a mine engineer I think he advised her much to go for that
01/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 7:08 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Thank you until tomorrow then

02/11/23, 11:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe Ropafadzo is mesmerized by the geographical treasures our beautiful planet has to offer. However, are you aware mining is a sector or a topic that falls within a humongous domain, i.e., Geography?
02/11/23, 12:03 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I'm aware
02/11/23, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. As Ropafadzo's *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide her towards a path that caters to her aspirations. I have analyzed her endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will align perfectly with her magnificent vision:

02/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that a student can venture into the field of mining after completing a BA in Geography. Geography provides a foundation in understanding landscapes, natural resources, and environmental processes, which can be relevant to the mining sector in areas such as land reclamation, environmental impact assessment, or site selection!
02/11/23, 3:15 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I'm not sure
02/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Claude! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
02/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
02/11/23, 3:39 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think so. I will give it a try. You know all things are possible with God
02/11/23, 3:43 pm - +27 74 513 3207: The first semester starts from when to when? And the second semester also starts from when to when?
02/11/23, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. The next possible intake is July-August 2024.
02/11/23, 3:51 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Ok
02/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That means the first semester is scheduled to take place from July-August 2024 to December-January 2024.
02/11/23, 4:13 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Okay, understood.
02/11/23, 4:13 pm - +27 74 513 3207: What travel documents are needed?
02/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Claude, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well moving on, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - +27 74 513 3207: No
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
02/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
02/11/23, 4:44 pm - +27 74 513 3207: This is very good as I can see it. Yes it will be very beneficial to my child
02/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
02/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
02/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
02/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

02/11/23, 4:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Ropafadzo can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on her parents?
02/11/23, 4:51 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I can see. Quite interesting
02/11/23, 4:52 pm - +27 74 513 3207: This EWYL program is good
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
02/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
02/11/23, 5:06 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think point number 4. But all four points are good
02/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Claude! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
02/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Ropafadzo studying abroad?
02/11/23, 5:13 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I feel very much impressed
02/11/23, 5:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents.
02/11/23, 5:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
02/11/23, 5:28 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I think those three are definitely required. Thus the Application form, Purpose and the letter of Recommendation
02/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
02/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/11/23, 5:49 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Okay, understood.
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I have got a question. Ropafadzo is writing her exams right now. And the results will be out around end of January 2024. So does that mean you will wait for her results to consider her eligible or
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Claude. Getting a seat as well as the scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/11/23, 6:27 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Okay, Understood. Thank you very much for updating
02/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to assist you through the process, Mr. Claude!
02/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
02/11/23, 6:41 pm - +27 74 513 3207: What I have picked from the discussed payment policy is that, once we manage to pay the enrollment fee and if the child is hardworking on the EWYL program it gonna be easy going forward. Also I can see that Edoofa will be helping the child and parents in many occasions like payment plan
02/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
02/11/23, 6:54 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Exactly thank you for summarising for me
02/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 7:14 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think today we discussed quite a number of phases I think from point 1 up to point 4
02/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/11/23, 7:37 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes you can explain 5 and 6
02/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
02/11/23, 7:43 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes clear
02/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

02/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Mr. Claude!
02/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.

03/11/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
03/11/23, 11:55 am - +27 74 513 3207: I was given Mrs Ruth number yesterday. Unfortunately I haven't talked to her as of now due to a bit of pressure of work. I think I will talk to her tomorrow Saturday.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

06/11/23, 6:21 pm - +27 74 513 3207: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th November 2023 for $200 and the 11th or 12th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/11/23, 6:34 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I don't think I'm prepared, these dates are way too close for me
06/11/23, 6:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing ?
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Honestly speaking, I didn't think the payments will start this year, I thought they would start next year towards the beginning of the semester.
06/11/23, 7:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Ropafadzo, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Ropafadzo's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
06/11/23, 8:01 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Yes
06/11/23, 8:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Ropafadzo's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Ropafadzo's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
06/11/23, 8:33 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Still digesting
06/11/23, 8:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Pardon
06/11/23, 11:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 12:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
As scheduled Shall we start our today's session?
07/11/23, 12:17 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Good morning yes
07/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So what have you finalized ?
07/11/23, 2:08 pm - +27 74 513 3207: It's very unfortunate that I don't have money right now considering the 7 day deadline.  I also think that I didn't have enough information from the beginning, since I'm leaving in South Africa and my family is in Zimbabwe.
07/11/23, 2:13 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I thought when the results are out that's when we start pursuing these applications, so to start payments this November, honestly speaking I didn't have plans for that.
07/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How much amount have you managed so far ?
07/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Result will come in March april will you be able to pay entire fees and other expenses abroad in just 2 month at that time ?
07/11/23, 2:54 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Now that I know the figures, I will save towards that and I think I will be able
07/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If you are not ready now how will you even manage just in 2 months that too at that time cost of Education will also go up next year .
07/11/23, 3:25 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think I will manage
07/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you share how ?
07/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: "If you haven't been able to prepare financially for Ropafdzo's tertiary education during the past 16-17 years, how do you plan to manage everything in just two months, especially while she is now just 3 months away from results?
07/11/23, 4:25 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I think this question is too harsh for me
07/11/23, 4:26 pm - +27 74 513 3207: How can you say that
07/11/23, 5:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am really sorry but I want to explain you from my previous experiences all parents who start 2 months back always end up wasting one year so you should start early in installments as this save your time and money.
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - +27 74 513 3207: It's always different the way we get our moneys
07/11/23, 5:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Pardon are you in touch with other parents who have their kids studying with us ?
07/11/23, 5:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

09/11/23, 3:19 pm - +27 74 513 3207: We concluded that we finalize this enrollment issue as a family today then we let you know the outcome tomorrow
09/11/23, 6:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
10/11/23, 10:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
10/11/23, 10:32 am - +27 74 513 3207: I'm good and you
10/11/23, 11:10 am - Sahil Edoofa: Any updates ?
10/11/23, 11:22 am - +27 74 513 3207: Yes as a family we concluded that we can enroll Ropafadzo as soon as the results are out
10/11/23, 11:22 am - Sahil Edoofa: Why not now ?
10/11/23, 11:23 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do you think considering high volume of applications we get daily will there be any seats left of scholarship will wait for your child?
10/11/23, 11:44 am - +27 74 513 3207: I think I have said this before that I had planned for the enrollment after the results
10/11/23, 11:45 am - Sahil Edoofa: ?
10/11/23, 11:53 am - +27 74 513 3207: With the grace of God I think so
10/11/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Give me one valid reason why scholarship should wait for you ?
10/11/23, 12:32 pm - +27 74 513 3207: It's not a matter of scholarship waiting for me but it's a matter of finances
10/11/23, 12:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you elaborate ?
10/11/23, 1:28 pm - +27 74 513 3207: Like I said before that I planned for this next year after the results
10/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Then why did you even apply now ?
10/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you wasted your child's only one change he had .
10/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please note that the intake for 2024 is already open and Form 6 students are reserving their seats for the same if qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared on 7th August this year, Malawians received their MSCE results in September, Zambians receive the results this year itself when compared to Zimsec A level results(January-February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. So we already have 700+ Zimbabwean students who have qualified for the next intake.
10/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
10/11/23, 5:51 pm - +27 74 513 3207: I wasn't aware of this. I quoted a statement which was saying students can apply the year they are finishing their high education or after the results are out.
