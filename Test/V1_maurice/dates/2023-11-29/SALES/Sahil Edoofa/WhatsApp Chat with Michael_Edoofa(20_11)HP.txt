20/11/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Michael, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Anna!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
20/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I understand Edoofa is an international program that is offering students around the world to acquire affordable education from Universities around the world. Edoofa also offers a counseling session to help students pick the right course in their desired fields of study. It is a program that offers between 50% scholarships to 100% depending on the program and university making it affordable for international student to study abroad in different countries.
20/11/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Michael, I am glad you have awareness, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe.

20/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Well understood Ms. Harmehak
20/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
20/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 355 8896: That's  correct, yes!
20/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Michael, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Chinhoyi high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay!

I am a boy aged 18, and I just recently finished my Advanced level public examinations on the 10th of this month and waiting for my results which is belive will be good. I was the school headboy for 2022-23 and would like to believe I did the best I could to serve Chinhoyi high. Speaking of Chinhoyi High school we pay a total of $514 per term including all levies. I was in the Arts class as stated in my application, and I would like to study *Law*. My strengths lay more in  leadership. I'm someone with good leadership skills, team leading and decision making skills, I can work well under pressure and know when to do and when to delegate. I can take instructions very well in the same way I can give off instructions to my subordinates. However my weaknesses lay in making hard choices that involve a large group of people and how to handle finances without adivice or supervision. I come from a family of 4,, both parents are still alive, and I have an 8 year old sister currently in her second grade primary level. My mother is self employed, and my father is into ICT and is based in South Africa.


Thats all I can say about myself. Is there anything else you might need to know??
20/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 355 8896: And Ms. Harmehak I got to know about Edoofa through my friend Vittalis Mufukare,, not Anna
20/11/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
20/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Thank you!
20/11/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Michael, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please,

It's great to know of you leadership skills too, 

Are you aware Edoofa is associated with your school?
20/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 355 8896: No I was not aware of that, since you hadn't mentioned it.
20/11/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.

We have students who are a part of the program, who are currently in India and would come to India in 2024, August.
20/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Yess I'd want to.
20/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: That's good
20/11/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I am confident enough, yes.
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 355 8896: How do I do that,, do I send pictures of my certificates or I just type the passes I had??
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Either would be fine for now please.
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 355 8896: What motivates me to study law? I believe in fighting for what is right, being the voice of the voiceless and being the one to stand up for the marginalized since we all have at least the right to be heard. Now as someone who was in a leadership position, I've seen alot of people often fall victim to people in my place and did not have anyone to stand up for them. Before my time to give instruction came I was also a person who took instruction from those that were above me before i rose, and I know how it is like being marginalized and helpless. Which is why I decided that my leadership should not just benefit me alone but also those around me and should be as leader of the people, hence I want to study Law.
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 355 8896: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Well received Michael
20/11/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a heart that only wishes for justice and you are intrigued towards doing the same by pursuing a career in Law.

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I have understood better now.
20/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright then Michael, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Having been provided with this career option, I see myself a high intellect young lawyer, striving to build a name and a reputation in the law society of my country and being an inspiration to other law aspiring students. This is where I see myself in 5 years.
20/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Michael, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Noticing the state in which my country is right now,, we need to import ideas from other developing countries, that means swallowing our pride of being patriotic as citizens, and going out there to see how other countries are tackling the same problems we are facing here and coming back to implement those ideas so that our country grows and develops. So as students as we go abroad to different countries and study different strategies to deal with different types problems our country is facing, that networking alone can rebuild our nation. This cannot be done with us in our country we have to be beyond our boarders in order to achieve this, which is why I want to go and study abroad. For better education of course and for skill development and learning experience in different cultures
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: You see, Michael, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 355 8896: It's true they are challenging. And it's true, that's the life learned graduates now live in Zimbabwe and I can testify to that
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Michael, however, I am equally glad that you are aware of the same and acknowledging the same, and along with that you are making efforts to bring changes!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I believe India's economy has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it might have actually overtaken China by now and that can also be attributed to its vast and efficient broad educational system. I belive it also has some of the best Law universities NLU in Delhi and Kolkata for example, well after the USA and UK of course ,, so I'm quite confident this will help me achieve my dreams in every way possible and at an affordable price too
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see that you have thorough awareness and knowledge, Michael!
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

20/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 355 8896: This is quite inspiring Indeed.
20/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Michael.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 355 8896: No. Please enlighten us.
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I see.. And the Earn while you learn what is it about??
20/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Michael, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
20/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: We shall discuss.
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Michael.
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I think that's fair on those students like us from third world countries,, affordable fees
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

20/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So does the program look for work for you or you get to do it on your own
20/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: You would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you with your program throughout your Degree.

That too while you are still in Zimbabwe.
20/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Oooh okay. I understand
20/11/23, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Oooh so are there guarantees that one will definitely get the EWYL program once they are there in India
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Michael.
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I do realize how different you are now.
20/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I'm ready
20/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Michael, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
20/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 355 8896: That something like $1500 to $2150
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: You see Michael, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So is there a guarantee that I'll secure a place at a proper university after paying the program fee??
20/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 355 8896: And what if it is a scam??
20/11/23, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, just like I mentioned is a guaranteed admission.

You pay only after you are found eligible for the program and you receive an acceptance letter.
20/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Acceptance letter from Edoofa or the university??
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - Harmehak: Do you believe an esteemed institution like your school would have associated with Edoofa if the program was a scam?

There are students currently in India from your school and students who would be coming to India next year.
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So do you give me a list of universities  to choose from or not.
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Currently you would receive an acceptance letter from Edoofa,

After which you would proceed with your admissions and your admission officer would proceed with your university admission.
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I hadn't put that in mind
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Where in you would receive acceptance letter from different universities and would decide yourself the one you would like to opt for.
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 355 8896: This only comes after I pass the eligibility test??
20/11/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: You would be connected with them tomorrow.

Tomorrow Mr Sahil would share the list of students who are a part of the program from your school.
20/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay okay,, now that's better
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes, a proper Interview with the Program Director would be conducted where your parents would take part as well.
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I'm looking forward to it
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So this is done before or after results are out??
20/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Now itself when you would proceed with your application to further stages, Michael.

I would provide you with thorough information and resources for a better understanding before we conclude.

I am currently in the process itself.
20/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Oooh,, that's acceptable <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay this sounds okay to me
20/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I have understood, though I did not understand  phase two properly
20/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: Which phase 2 are you referring to please?

Stage 2 of Edoofa cycle or Phase 2 of payment policy?
20/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Phase 2 here. Enrollment process
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: Like we were discussing earlier that you start with your Earn While You Learn Program while you are still in Zimbabwe please.

Phase 2 is explaining the same.
20/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Ooooh I understand now, thanks
20/11/23, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: Ndudzo Kelly N from Chinhoyi 2 High School also happens to be Senior Career Counselor, Mr Sahil's student!

Vanessa Stacy Saungweme	 from Chinhoyi High School.

These two students are currently in India, while others would be joining the August 2024 intake.
20/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I know Vanessa Stacy,, yess
20/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

20/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay okay thank you
20/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So Edoofa will assist throughout the whole process??
20/11/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
20/11/23, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: You get it renewed once in India,

Visa officer would assist you.
20/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay I understand.
20/11/23, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: Your enrollment fee does include thorough visa assistance.
20/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 355 8896: So how is the enrollment fee paid??
20/11/23, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: It's paid through online banking modes, the modes are properly explained in your acceptance letter too.
20/11/23, 9:20 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/11/23, 9:20 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/11/23, 9:20 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

21/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Yess sir now is a good time
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I was caught up with some work
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 355 8896: The session went well, thank you.
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 355 8896: We heard the testimony from her two daughters
21/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you not call her ?
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Noo we did not.
21/11/23, 3:59 pm - +27 63 101 5527: I will be in touch with her in an hour
21/11/23, 7:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?

22/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same?
22/11/23, 7:44 pm - +27 63 101 5527: Yes we are to give all necessary support to the best of our abilities
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

22/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th November 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th   of November 2023.

27/11/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer this?

27/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Okay fine. Thank you
28/11/23, 10:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me guide you about the modes of payment in depth .
28/11/23, 10:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
28/11/23, 10:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
