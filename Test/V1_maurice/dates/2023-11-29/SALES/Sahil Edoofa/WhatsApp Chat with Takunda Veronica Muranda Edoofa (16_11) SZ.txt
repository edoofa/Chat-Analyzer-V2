17/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Takunda.
17/11/23, 10:15 pm - +27 66 227 9042: I'm done. It is truly remarkable to see all that India has achieved and the opportunities it holds.
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) sector shines brightly on the global stage, thanks to its dedication to precision, innovation, and healthcare excellence. With a burgeoning healthcare industry, India has emerged as a hub for cutting-edge medical diagnostics and laboratory services. The skilled MLT professionals in India play a vital role in providing accurate and efficient healthcare solutions worldwide. Their commitment to maintaining international standards in medical testing and diagnostics is truly praiseworthy, making India a significant contributor to global healthcare advancements!
17/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takunda, Many of the healthcare and diagnostic companies in India, especially the larger ones with a significant presence, are recognized and respected globally. They often adhere to international standards and quality practices, making their diagnostic and healthcare services reliable not only in India but also for patients worldwide!

For example, diagnostic laboratories like Dr. Lal PathLabs and SRL Diagnostics are known for their high-quality services and have international accreditations. Hospitals like Apollo Hospitals and Fortis Healthcare have gained recognition for their healthcare services and medical tourism programs, attracting patients from various countries!
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - +27 66 227 9042: It is inspiring to see how global and respected this industry is.
17/11/23, 10:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 10:35 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Due to India great healthcare system I believe studying in India will improve my chances of being a great medical lab technician. India has a robust and up to date education system so I highly doubt I would lack in anything in terms of my education. Due to the huge demand for medical lab technicians I think I will be able to find employment in the future. My studies in India will help me and enable to help and assist and save lives as a medical lab technician.
17/11/23, 10:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/11/23, 10:38 pm - +27 66 227 9042: No I don't think I am.
17/11/23, 10:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Takunda! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/11/23, 10:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
17/11/23, 10:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/11/23, 10:42 pm - +27 66 227 9042: I don't think it will be great but I'm sure my parents will do their best for my education.
17/11/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takunda. May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
17/11/23, 10:44 pm - +27 66 227 9042: I think the accommodation and if I have to pay any tuition that might be too straineous on my parents.
17/11/23, 10:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, please.
17/11/23, 10:45 pm - +27 66 227 9042: My apologies I think I misread the message.
17/11/23, 10:46 pm - +27 66 227 9042: After reading again I think my parents will be able to afford.
17/11/23, 10:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takunda. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
17/11/23, 10:47 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes please.
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takunda. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/11/23, 10:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
17/11/23, 10:50 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes I think it will be beneficial for me. It's not only an opportunity for me to lessen my parents burden but also gain work experience that will help me in the future.
17/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
17/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
17/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
17/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

17/11/23, 10:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
17/11/23, 10:53 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes it is now very clear.
17/11/23, 10:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/11/23, 10:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/11/23, 10:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/11/23, 10:55 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Higher education concierge.
17/11/23, 10:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Takunda. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
17/11/23, 10:55 pm - +27 66 227 9042: I believe if it wasn't for them most students wouldn't be aware of all the opportunities
17/11/23, 10:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 10:57 pm - +27 66 227 9042: As much as they are excited for me to further my studies, the thought of me being far away also brings a lot of fear and concerns to their minds.
17/11/23, 10:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
17/11/23, 10:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Furthermore, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! After the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
17/11/23, 10:58 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Thank you
17/11/23, 10:59 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Okay I would appreciate that.
17/11/23, 10:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
17/11/23, 11:00 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes I think that's all.
17/11/23, 11:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
17/11/23, 11:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/11/23, 11:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 11:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
17/11/23, 11:03 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Okay I understand
17/11/23, 11:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/11/23, 11:04 pm - +27 66 227 9042: That will be appreciated.
17/11/23, 11:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
17/11/23, 11:08 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Edoofa assists in providing a 50-100% scholarship. The scholarship covers tuition and the student has to cove the remaining amount. Students can enroll in the earn while you learn program that gives scholarship points for the work you do. The student is required to pay 350 in a span of 7 days.
17/11/23, 11:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
17/11/23, 11:09 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Thank you
17/11/23, 11:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 11:11 pm - +27 66 227 9042: We have covered phase 1 and we are at 2
17/11/23, 11:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/11/23, 11:12 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes
17/11/23, 11:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
17/11/23, 11:13 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes I am
17/11/23, 11:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to facilitate a connection with a parent who can provide valuable insights. Mr. Darlington, an esteemed educationalist from South Africa, serves as the School Head at one of the schools in South Africa. His child is a beneficiary of the Edoofa scholarship program and is currently pursuing studies in India. I believe that Mr. Darlington can offer you valuable information about his experience with the Edoofa scholarship program and how it has enabled his child's international education journey.

17/11/23, 11:14 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Okay thank you I believe that will be helpful.
17/11/23, 11:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takunda. You mentioned Zimbabwe in one of your messages. May I know whether you have a connection with the respective country, please?
17/11/23, 11:15 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes I am Zimbabwean
17/11/23, 11:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: And you are currently residing in South Africa, please?
17/11/23, 11:16 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes I'm currently residing in south Africa
17/11/23, 11:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Takunda! I would now like to connect you with a particular parent as well. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

17/11/23, 11:20 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Thank you so much
18/11/23, 11:44 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
18/11/23, 12:07 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes we are
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +27 73 957 3095: Ye I am
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +27 73 957 3095: Yes I am
18/11/23, 12:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
18/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 66 227 9042: It went very well. All the questions were addressed and all my concerns were catered for.
18/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
18/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 66 227 9042: No we have not had the opportunity to connect with her.
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Its okay you can connect today
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
18/11/23, 5:07 pm - +27 66 227 9042: 1. Bachelor of science in medical laboratory technology
2.India
3. $6000-$8000
4. $2000-$3000 but it can be further reduced to $1200-$1800
5. $350
6. 7 days
7. Yes
18/11/23, 6:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
18/11/23, 6:37 pm - +27 66 227 9042: Yes they are ready
18/11/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge the same in this group ?
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - +27 78 793 2464: Its a good program. I recommend
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd November 2023 for $200 and the 22nd or 23rd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - +27 78 793 2464: For now lm financially unstable since I have another child who will need fees for third year university here.
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know please do you want me to help you child or not ?
18/11/23, 7:43 pm - +27 78 793 2464: For now I won't afford
18/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which part is not affordable for you?
18/11/23, 8:04 pm - +27 78 793 2464: I really need her to study but finances are a stumbling block. It will be wise enough for me to give myself a year to raise funds for her. Starting from registration and tuition. I don't want her to be a financial burden in a foreign state.
19/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let us reconvene for our session tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time with a fresh and focused mindset to continue our discussion. Your active participation in the session is an important parameter for evaluating your application.

As Psalm 119:105 says, 'Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.' Similarly, let our conversation illuminate the path to your educational journey.

21/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/11/23, 11:57 am - +27 66 227 9042: Good morning
I'm doing well thank you
After a discussion with my family we realised it might be better for me to apply for the scholarship again next year so that I can give my parents time to prepare mentally and financially.
21/11/23, 11:58 am - +27 66 227 9042: I apologize for the inconvenience caused.
21/11/23, 12:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are they facing for now so that I can help them?
21/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 78 793 2464: I have another child who is at University and the fees is around US$5000 excluding accommodation and food. The other two need 200$ per month by 10 months. Financial I cannot manage. That is why we are opting for her to reapply next year.
21/11/23, 1:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In which university ?
21/11/23, 1:36 pm - +27 78 793 2464: University of Johannesburg in south Africa
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In which year ?
21/11/23, 2:35 pm - +27 78 793 2464: She is going for third year next year
21/11/23, 3:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When will she complete her degree ?
21/11/23, 3:15 pm - +27 78 793 2464: She is left with two years if all goes well.
21/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: And which course is she studying ?
21/11/23, 3:33 pm - +27 78 793 2464: Bsc Engineering. Majoring in extraction metallurgy
21/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: But that is a 4 year course at every good university .
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - +27 66 227 9042: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 3:52 pm - +27 78 793 2464: It's a 4 year course. She has done 2 years now she is left with another 2 years
21/11/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay please I can understand
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You are currently paying more than 6000 for one child in SA . I can understand it would be Difficult for you to manage for other child's fees at the same time so may I know how would you want me to help your child ?
21/11/23, 5:34 pm - +27 78 793 2464: What I think is best is for her to start the process next year. For now even the 350 for application will be a big challenge on my side since I'm trying to settle some fees arrears this side.
21/11/23, 6:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would strongly recommend that you consider taking gradual steps at this point. Initiating the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program for Takunda, similar to what Persistence accomplished, can be beneficial. This approach not only enables her to self-finance her fees but also provides an opportunity to acquire valuable skills. In countries like India, renowned multinational companies like Google and Microsoft actively recruit students during their pre-final year directly on campus. By participating in the EWYL project, Takunda can showcase her skills, giving her a competitive advantage over other students in the job market.
21/11/23, 6:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Takunda, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Takunda's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
21/11/23, 6:40 pm - +27 78 793 2464: Its fine
21/11/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 78 793 2464: Good afternoon
22/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Takunda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Takunda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
23/11/23, 11:49 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
23/11/23, 10:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
27/11/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you had a pleasant weekend.

So shall we start our discussion now?
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
