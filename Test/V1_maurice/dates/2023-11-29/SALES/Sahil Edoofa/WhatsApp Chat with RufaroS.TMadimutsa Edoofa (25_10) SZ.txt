01/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 195 2382: I  am now free sir
01/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Rufaro! Can you please acknowledge this question?
01/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Okay
01/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Yes sir I have learned a lot about the EWYL program and if l got the opportunity for the scholarship l am willing to work very hard so that l will  earn money to pay for the fees ,at the same time gaining experience and reduce financial pressure to my parents
01/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
01/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
01/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Well,  l appreciate that Edoofa scholarship is very affordable ,l can gain real world  experience because it is employability throught practical based, earning whilst I am learning can reduce burden to my parents . Lastly Edoofa will help  me to choose the right career
01/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Rufaro! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
01/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Okay l particularly liked the fact of  affordability through guaranteed scholarships (point 1)
01/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 195 2382: My  family is very happy about it and willing to support me
01/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
01/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
01/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 195 2382: I don't know much  about what is required to apply for an international scholarship
01/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
01/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
01/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Okay sir I have understood the process
01/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
01/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Alright sir thank you for the information
01/11/23, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
01/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 195 2382: I have understood that Edoofa program offers a minimum scholarship of 50 to 100 percent .A student have the opportunity to learn whilst learning to reduce the burden cost of there education.l also learned that if a student receives an acceptance letter a program fee of $350 should be paid within a period of 7 days and if the parents fails to do so, they can only pay $200 within 7 days and pay the remaining balance  $150 within next 30 days
01/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
01/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Alright thank you sir
01/11/23, 10:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Firstly, we have discussed about the requirements and process required to become a chartered accountant . Secondly , we discussed about India and it's  education system. Thirdly, we discussed about the EWYL program which offers credit facilities to students and the cost of education in lndia. Forthly, we discussed about the requirements to apply for a University abroad. Lastly the phases of the enrollment process. I think we are at stage 2 eligibility check test & interview
01/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Yes you can explain sor
01/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 195 2382: *sir
01/11/23, 10:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
01/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 78 195 2382: Yes sir
01/11/23, 10:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities?

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future . <This message was edited>

06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

09/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Alright sir that's fine
10/11/23, 10:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
10/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 781 0931: We are fine sir how are you
10/11/23, 11:54 am - Sahil Edoofa: Did you connect with her ?
10/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Not yet sir but I will do

10/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Yes I do
10/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Sorry for late response sir I'm at work
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

16/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Failing what please ?
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 781 0931: We have seen that all the money needed for all the processes and also the fees we cannot afford sir.
16/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which amount are you concerned for now ?
16/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You only have to manage the enrollment fees for now. Tution fees you pay once students is in India so you have enough time to manage that as well.
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 781 0931: All the costs  , enrolment fees , tution fees , flight costs , visa and processing fees sir.
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: All this is paid in parts noboby pays everything at once ,be honest with have you calculated the cost of Studying in Zimbabwe similarly ?
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 781 0931: To be honest sir we are afraid that we may fail to get the money for fees and her pocket money  as well
16/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you ask Mrs.Ruth how she is able to fund both her daughter being a single mother and a scale scale farmer with help of Earn while you learn programme?
16/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 781 0931: I asked her
16/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So what have you understood ?
16/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263777810931 Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Maybe if the tution  fees for Rufaro  was disclosed I would make an informed decision
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It would be around 2000-3000 including food accommodation and basic expenses which if you calculate is less than the cost of studying in Zimbabwe .also I personally will discuss with the admission team at that time so that you get higher quantum of scholarship so cost will go to $1200-$1800 annually which further can be reduced through Earn while you learn program.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can compare this cost in Zimbabwe and what quality of Education you get abroad .
16/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Is it definate that she will get a higher percentage of scholarship sir
16/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes I will request board to give higher scholarship on Bachelor in Commerce
16/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 781 0931: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Where do the international students be staying during some semester breaks
16/11/23, 4:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It's their wish they can visit home or they can stay in the hostels.
16/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 781 0931: Will they be monitered if they in hostels so that they cannot do immoral activities
