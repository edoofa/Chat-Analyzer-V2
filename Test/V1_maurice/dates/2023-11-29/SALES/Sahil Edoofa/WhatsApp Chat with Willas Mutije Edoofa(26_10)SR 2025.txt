01/11/23, 12:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
01/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir I'm super confident about achieving that as my goal

01/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 152 3136: The motivation of me studying abroad for this course(accounting)is that , I believe there isn't a more exciting privilege in life than to be able to discover new places , meet new people and to just surround myself in traditions and cultures that are entirely different from my own.More over , by using international accounting,the business can spread it's operations whole over the world and l will be useful to multinational operations.However, l will graduate with specific accounting knowledge and transferable skills you can use across industries.

03/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Studying in India can help me to advance in my job because it gives me the opportunity for the employers to look that I have an open mind, resourcefulness and drive needed to adapt to a different environment because many employers look for graduates who have an international experience.It also boosts my resume by showing my skill set.Studying in India experience shows employers that you are independent enough to learn in new environments , which can translate into being independent at work and it also shows that I am a problem solver with the ability to quickly process new information. I am aiming to achieve my career goals with this degree as a result of studying in India,l can develop both broad based and field specific knowledge.l may also have a chance to grow important hard and soft skills by participating in experiential learning opportunities which are relevant

As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
03/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 152 3136: No I'm not familiar to that
03/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: -**let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

And do you have any idea how that's done?
04/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 152 3136: No Sir I don't have any idea

06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
06/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 152 3136: My views are that students who become actively involved on campus tend to be better about managing their time and responsibilities. Studies show that students who work more hours a week do just as well or even better academically than those who don't.
06/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
06/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
06/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
06/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

06/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir now i understand how it works
06/11/23, 6:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir l really appreciate that and thank you
06/11/23, 7:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
06/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes you supposed to buy an application form
06/11/23, 7:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
06/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 152 3136: No Sir
06/11/23, 7:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
06/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 152 3136: I think it will be 150-200 isn't it sir
06/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
06/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Do there any assurance?
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: They don't give any assurance and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
06/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir I'm really confident that I'm capable for this challenge
06/11/23, 8:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
06/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 152 3136: SOP I think is a critical piece of a graduate school application that tells admissions committee who you are, what your academic and professional interests are and how you'll add value to the graduate program you are applying
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
06/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir I do understand
06/11/23, 8:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 152 3136: For 5 application forms l think you need to spend 750 -1000
06/11/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
06/11/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 152 3136: So Sir , which amount you have to pay altogether including all expenses
06/11/23, 9:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
06/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Thank you Sir now I understand
06/11/23, 9:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
06/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 152 3136: After discussing about the payment policy of the enrollment fee of the program,l understand that through acceptance in the Edoofa program,a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee and the student saves UpTo 1000-1500 in application fees .The students are supposed to buy an application form and the average application fee of a University is around 150-200. So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges you have to pay the application fee for each college differently. The students are allowed to enroll in the program only they are a part of Edoofa. So to get eligible you will have to pass your eligibility check interview. A student is to prepare a SOP in order to convince the admission board. The student is helped by Edoofa to arrange and pay the finances by themselves through EWYL program which helps the student higher education affordable and comparable to local Universities.
06/11/23, 9:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 152 3136: We discussed the first phase which is a personalized counseling session and now we are going to the second phase which is eligibility check test and interview
06/11/23, 9:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well @263781523136 , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.
06/11/23, 9:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
06/11/23, 9:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the process?
06/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

07/11/23, 6:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263782956191 @263775090866 I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Willas, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Willas's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?

How are you doing today?
08/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 152 3136: I'm fine and you sir
08/11/23, 12:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
08/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Willas's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Willas's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?@263782956191
08/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 295 6191: It's ok sir

08/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 295 6191: Thank you for your understanding...
08/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Thank you Sir
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Willas's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
08/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Your interview has been scheduled 12 PM CAT tomorrow. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call.

15/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
15/11/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family manage to go through your acceptance letter ?
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 152 3136: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes
15/11/23, 1:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did parents go through it ?
15/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Sir we made a payment plan on how the enrollment fee is going to be paid
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 152 3136: Yes sir
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

15/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 152 3136: the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Willas's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have a time of 58
