21/11/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: How exciting it is to know the same now, Mitchel?
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes, It is exciting to know.
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay l understood.

It is a big industry that contributes to the economy of many counties since it provides foreign currency , employment creation and education.

The country is also home to many world-class universities, including the Indian Institutes of Technology  and the Indian Institute of Management, which are highly regarded for their academic excellence. India is a rapidly growing economy, making it an ideal place to pursue a career in tourism.
21/11/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see you have awareness and knowledge, Mitchel.
21/11/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

21/11/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 252 6236: I have understood
21/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Alright....l am glad to know this
21/11/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mitchel.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes, I'm familiar with the cost of higher education in India. The cost of pursuing a degree from a top university in India is significantly lower than studying at a similar institution in other countries, even without a scholarship.  Master's degree from the Indian can cost between (100,000-200,000 rupees) per year which is 1 200USD or 2 400USD
21/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please
21/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Ooh okay
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 252 6236: I am glad to know this
21/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
21/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 252 6236: This is great
21/11/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Mitchel, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
21/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes l agree
21/11/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mitchel?
21/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes now l know
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great, now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail.
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay
21/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Now l know more about the Edoofa Program
21/11/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: That's good!
21/11/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 252 6236: The student would be earning credits towards their tuition by working part-time in their field of study. The credits earned would offset the cost of tuition by $100 per month, or $1200 per year right so the total cost of tuition, food, and accommodation would then be reduced to $1000 per year. And finally, the monthly cost for the student's education would be only $90-$100 per month.
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Mitchel!
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes l realise now
21/11/23, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mitchel, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes am ready
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Mitchel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay
21/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Please?
21/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Based on the range you provided, the student would be spending between $1500-$2250 to apply to five universities. That's a significant amount of money for a student to spend without any guarantee of admission or financial aid.
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Mitchel, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 71 252 6236: That's true
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes l think so
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes l have understood
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Noted
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Noted
21/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Yes l have understood
21/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 252 6236: So acceptance is done before my results has come out?
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

You would proceed on the basis of provisional admissions and previous term results.
21/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

21/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay understood
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 252 6236: Okay thank you
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

23/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th November 2023 for $200 and the 28th or 29th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 192 3142: Hello, we are not financially stable at the moment. We  thought the enrolment fee will be paid after the A level results are out .
23/11/23, 5:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When will Mitchel get the results ?
23/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 192 3142: End of January or 1st week of February 2024.
23/11/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The 2024 intake for education abroad is closing soon. The process for studying abroad is distinct, involving the preparation of various documents. Students typically apply 8-10 months in advance, considering that classes commence in July.

Unlike local universities, the process for education abroad is not as flexible. It requires meticulous planning and document preparation, and intakes have specific closing dates. It's a structured system that differs significantly from the more flexible admissions process at local universities.
23/11/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In Zimbabwe, local education faces challenges in terms of quality and infrastructure, with a ranking of 129. In contrast, India is positioned at 2, reflecting a significantly higher standard in both education quality and infrastructure.
23/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 192 3142: What if she fails to get the required points and we have already paid the money.

23/11/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As discussed by your counselor our process is totally transparent if students fails in A level then student will have 2 options either students can apply for improvement or the money paid by parents will be refunded back to them as it is.

So in simple your money is safe so consider this as an investment
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 192 3142: Noted thank you
23/11/23, 5:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Also you won't be affected by price surge of International education as course fees will remain the same throughout the course duration if selected .
23/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 192 3142: As of now we were not prepared for the enrolment fee the deadline is too soon .
23/11/23, 5:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Mitchel, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Mitchel's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
23/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 192 3142: Yes we are good to have a word
23/11/23, 5:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Mitchel's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Mitchel's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
23/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 192 3142: Ok let us see what we can do

I am saying this because that's when we get the money and that was also our plan for our child.
