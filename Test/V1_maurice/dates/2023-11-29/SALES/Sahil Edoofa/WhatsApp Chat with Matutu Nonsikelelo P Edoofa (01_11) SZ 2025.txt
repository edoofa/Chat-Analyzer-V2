02/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 719 1442: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad as well?
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Studying abroad is one of the best ways to acquire global skills and access personal and professional opportunities. I want to change my life experience
02/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Nonsikelelo! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook.

02/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Nonsikelelo. Can you please share your previous term results as well?

02/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Nonsikelelo. Your co-operation is highly appreciated!
02/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
02/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yess l am confident
02/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Nonsikelelo! You mentioned that you have an affinity towards the Healthcare Sector. Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
02/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I want to be a surgeon  doctor  because m have realised that most  people  usually suffer when they are in  need of a doctor ..some of them even end up dying ,which is so painful  .thereby l had interest  in being  that person  (doctor) who will be available to  help those in need o. Doctor's. Assistance
02/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your perspective, Nonsikelelo. However, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I did want to do  biology but l had to consider  the best 3 subjects  that will take me to A Level.  Since they say physics  has high opportunities  and many programs  in varsity  ,even those programs that need biology  can take you  if you have physics .
And  also physics  helps you in doing critical  thinking  as it is  very difficult
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
02/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Right now l am doing physics , mathematics  and chemistry
02/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo.Your subject combination is closely aligned with the engineering field. Individuals aspiring to pursue a career in engineering frequently opt for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics in their A-Level studies. I'd like to inquire whether this particular domain holds a special fascination for you?
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I am okay with engineering  also
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You mentioned your affinity for engineering. Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
02/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Which engineering programmes do you offer
02/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. May I kindly enquire which program intrigues you the most in Engineering, please?
02/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Civil  engineering
02/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
02/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I want to design  and construct building  n roads which will be of great use to the society
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations. I have analyzed your endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will align perfectly with your magnificent vision:

*B.Tech Civil*
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
02/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 719 1442: No
02/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
02/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 719 1442: No reason
02/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yes l do need the guide
02/11/23, 5:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please explain this message, Nonsikelelo?
02/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It was a mistake..if l may say  wrong message to wrong person
02/11/23, 6:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Nonsikelelo.
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech Civil
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I understand
02/11/23, 6:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
02/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It does
02/11/23, 6:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: If you are provided with this career option How do you see yourself in 5 years after completion of this course and how may Edoofa's Program help you reach your goals?
02/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 719 1442: By supporting  me in every course
02/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please reframe your message, Nonsikelelo?
02/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 719 1442: In 5 years time  l see my self  being   graduated to be a qualified  engineer  with the help of Edoofa program

03/11/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Okay l will
03/11/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Due to poor  Network  my messages  take time to deliver
04/11/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"You have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world." - Harriet Tubman*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 719 1442: Yes l am
04/11/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Nonsikelelo!
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
04/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 719 1442: Yes l am
04/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 719 1442: I read and understand  the information  from the previous lesson
04/11/23, 10:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
04/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 719 1442: Yes l am sure of studying in India
04/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 719 1442: It will help mee develop  new skills  and cultures  also learn a new language  and lastly pursue my dream
04/11/23, 10:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
04/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 719 1442: Nope
04/11/23, 12:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Nonsikelelo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
04/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It is not
04/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
04/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Tuition and living
04/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country?
04/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 719 1442: 400 to 600 dollars
04/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
04/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Per semester
04/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, Nonsikelelo.
04/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It's true that if you learn in Zimbabwe  it's difficult to get a job
04/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Nonsikelelo. You will be glad to know that India's job market in civil engineering is nothing short of impressive. With its robust infrastructure development and construction projects, there is a continuous demand for skilled civil engineers. The field offers numerous opportunities for professionals to apply their expertise and contribute to the nation's growth. What's even more encouraging is that the sector is known for providing competitive salaries, recognizing and rewarding the skills and knowledge of civil engineers. It's not just a job market; it's a platform for ambitious individuals to make a meaningful impact and secure a financially rewarding career!
04/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 719 1442: If you  say so then in India its easy to find a job
04/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Furthermore, it is a rewarding one, Nonsikelelo.
04/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well Nonsikelelo, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
04/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 719 1442: What do you  mean by scholarship credits
04/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nonsikelelo. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
04/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know
04/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I'm  in rural areas right and there is poor network
04/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Nonsikelelo. However, I would request you to be active for the next 30 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
04/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
04/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yes it will be beneficial
04/11/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
04/11/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
04/11/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
04/11/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.
04/11/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?

*"The expert in anything was once a beginner." – Helen Hayes*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yess l am ready
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Nonsikelelo!
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yess l am
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Mbusi! Can you please elaborate your message?
06/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It was a wrong  text
06/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Nonsikelelo. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this message?
06/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yes l do realise
06/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
06/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
06/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
06/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Point 3
06/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
06/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 719 1442: They are OK
Actually they feel happy
06/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
06/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 719 1442: It is
06/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
06/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
06/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
06/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
06/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I am concerned
06/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your message, Nonsikelelo?
06/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I am connected
06/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
06/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Oky
06/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Understood
06/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Edoofa helps in your financial when it comes to education.. by that l mean  you will be assisted to pay other things you can't afford using a lifespan
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
06/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I understand
06/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?

09/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
09/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 719 1442: I understand that

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

14/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes ?
14/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 719 1442: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for your response.
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 719 1442: 1
14/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answer using voice notes please.
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Currently  they are not online
14/11/23, 8:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting its important part of interview
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Yess
14/11/23, 8:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: keep me updated
14/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 719 1442: Oky l will
14/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 244 8941: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Seat for 2025 are to be reserved now
14/11/23, 9:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: She will commence her tertiary education after receiving her A-level results, and as a parent, careful planning for her career is crucial.
The early opening of the 2025 intake serves two important purposes:
Zimbabwean students receive their results later than other African nations. WAEC results from Ghana, Nigeria, and other Western African nations are typically declared mid-year. Malawians receive results around the same time, and Zambians receive theirs much earlier than Zimbabweans. Consequently, students from other nations may secure the majority of scholarship seats. To address this, we evaluate O-level and term results, interests, passions, career goals, extracurricular activities, achievements, and roles of responsibilities for Form 5 students applying for the Edoofa scholarship program. Additionally, we offer parents the opportunity to participate in sessions on behalf of applicants, ensuring deserving candidates don't miss out on this golden opportunity.
14/11/23, 9:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Furthermore, for 2025 students through the Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program, students have a 20-month period to learn and earn. This substantial duration allows students to self-finance a significant portion of their fees in their home country by utilizing spare time effectively. For instance, if a student works diligently and earns $80-100 per month during the EWYL program, they can accumulate enough funds to self-finance their entire fees. This approach significantly alleviates the financial burden on their parents.
15/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
