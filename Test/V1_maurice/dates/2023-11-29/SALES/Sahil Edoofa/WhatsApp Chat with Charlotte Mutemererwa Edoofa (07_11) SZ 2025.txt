They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

14/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I performed poorly last term due to less attendence of lessons when my father passed away at that time so I got 

Economics. C
Business studies.     F
Accounting.   F
14/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 372 7122: So I got 3 points in total but I hope and wish to pass with better results this term
14/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
14/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I am sir thank you
14/11/23, 5:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will pass your exams with flying colours, Charlotte!
14/11/23, 5:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
14/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I intend to study an accounting program which will expose me to fundamentals of finance and banking.
14/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
14/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I have a passion for commercial subjects mostly accounting since I started my secondary School

17/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I read it sir thank you
17/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
17/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Since India is well known for academic excellence and quality education, the chances of getting a job of my choice is very high and I could get opportunity of working in different countries and getting certain great position in jobs. Studying in India can help me in future in terms of theory and practical skills, which you mentioned above, if I get a job in any county I could be able to cooperate with their economical and social activities
17/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I do not know sir
17/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Charlotte! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
17/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes it is
17/11/23, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Charlotte. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
17/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes sir
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Charlotte. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
17/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 459 5268: I have a question, let say my sister is enrolled and then opts for the ewyl program, does she choose which company of firm to work for you Edofa chooses for her?
17/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 459 5268: Secondly if she is earning, does she earn the money or Edofa collects all the money she earns to cover her schooling expenses ?
17/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ms. Sharmaine!
17/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your query?
17/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 459 5268: If Charlotte is enrolled to study in India and she chooses the EWYL program, does Edofa chooses which company she will work for or will she choose the one she wants from the list of companies and projects you have listed.
17/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ms. Sharmaine. Throughout the course, EWYL mentors will introduce impactful projects to the students, aiming to ensure they acquire essential skills crucial for success in the 21st century.
17/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 459 5268: In case she gets sick and is taken to the hospital, does Edofa assist with the medical fees or Charlotte's family will have to send funds for her treatment?
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ms. Shamaine. It's worth mentioning that our universities have highly skilled medical professionals who provide free treatment for minor illnesses.
17/11/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 459 5268: Ok
17/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
17/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
17/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
17/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

17/11/23, 10:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Charlotte can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on her parents?
17/11/23, 10:42 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I understand now
17/11/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/11/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/11/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/11/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Point 2.  It is an advantage for me because it implies practical while doing theory learning which could help me in my career
17/11/23, 10:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Charlotte. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
17/11/23, 10:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 11:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 9:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

18/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
18/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
18/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Ok sir thank you
18/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
18/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes and also my A level results, I think
18/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
18/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Ok sir I understand, I hope my parents would be able to have the funds
18/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Okay sir  that's better. I understand now
18/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/11/23, 11:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom." - Oprah Winfrey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
20/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes sir
20/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Charlotte!
20/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
20/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 372 7122: What I've understand is that , all university expenses alone costs more than $1350 but with Edoofa program the costs will be only $750. To become a part of Edoofa program, a student will have to pay $350 if found eligible for the scholarship. The $350 fee will be paid within 7 days or $200 within 7 days and then pay the remaining fee within 30 days
20/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
20/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Ok thank you
20/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 372 7122: According to the chart, I'm at stage 1 where we are doing counseling sessions and the phrases we descussed are the financials of the scholarship program and the university and  how the program works
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Charlotte Mutemererwa Edoofa (07/11) SZ" to "Charlotte Mutemererwa Edoofa (07/11) SZ 2025"
20/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes please
20/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
20/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I'm clarified
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

20/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Unfortunately I don't have enough data to view the video that you have sent
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Charlotte. Please do watch the video at your convenience.
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Ok sir

20/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Not for now , but if I come up with any question I'll ask you
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Charlotte!
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Ok thank you sir
21/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
21/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes
21/11/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
21/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 372 7122: The session was good and helpful and he was addressing my questions
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Yes I connected with Mrs Ruth but so far her responses have not been satisfying, she is replying in an automated way repeating the same statements over and over again
21/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please did you not call her Directly ? as she is a farmer and she find difficult to use WhatsApp so you can call her Directly and clear your concerns as she is simple parent like your parents .
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I'll let my mom call when she get a chance
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Meanwhile can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 372 7122: 1. B.com
2. India 
3. $6000-$8000
4. $1200-$1800
5. $350
6. $200 within 7 days and the remaining fee within 30 days
7. Yes
21/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
21/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 520 9608: When is this supposed to be paid
21/11/23, 9:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I'm well, how are you?
22/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Enrollment fees is to paid in 7 days after selection
23/11/23, 11:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
23/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 372 7122: I'm well how are you?
23/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are parents ready for the same ?
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 459 5268: When is the selection going to happen
23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Tomorrow
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Thank you, If she is selected we would be really happy, however right now we are not in a favourable financial position to pay the enrollment fee. I am still paying for charlotte's fees and extra tutorials. I am hoping by next year I will be in a better financial position.
My husband's passing has really turned out life around and we are still trying to find means and ways to cover the financial gap he left us. I honestly thought since charlotte is still in lower six she might be selected next year.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Charlotte, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Charlotte's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
23/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Okay
23/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Charlotte's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Charlotte's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 520 9608: I understand, but for now I think Charlotte might have to re apply next year when I am financially stable
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Thank you for your offer
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: By then there  are changes that no seats will be left as this is a scholarship and student reserving seats very fast .
23/11/23, 10:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 12:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 520 9608: We're all fine
24/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 372 7122: We are fine
24/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What have you planned ?
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Nothing yet we are failing to find some cash
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How much time do you need ?
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Maybe up to next year
24/11/23, 4:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which month ?
24/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 520 9608: I'm sure maybe midyear
27/11/23, 12:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you had a pleasant weekend.

So shall we start our discussion now?
27/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Okay
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
28/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 372 7122: Everything is ok ,may you you highlight the message that we didn't respond
28/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you wish to move ahead or close your application ?
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 372 7122: I would like to move ahead
28/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So can parents answer this ?
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Time frame to run around looking for cash is too short for me that's why I suggested 2024 mid year
28/11/23, 5:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can apply back when you really are ready
28/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 520 9608: Okay thanks
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
