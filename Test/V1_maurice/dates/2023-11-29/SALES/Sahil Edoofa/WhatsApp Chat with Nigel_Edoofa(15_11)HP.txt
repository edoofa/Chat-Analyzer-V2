16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: @263715326737
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 532 6737: It was great Ms Harmehak  , I was motivated by the video. The video clearly showed what it means  to do good for people ,as you have transformed lives of different edoofians  whom you assisted to have quality education through edoofa scholarships.
The video lighted fire under me  , it made me want to go out there and do something  , whether it’s buying a plane ticket  to see the world or taking a big first step  to improve my life by working towards becoming an edoofian just like the other edoofians in the video you have just shared above
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: I am glad the video thoroughly helped you Nigel!
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Nigel, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Precious!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes I got to know about the program from Ms Precious. The edoofa scholarship program  is an organization  which has a vision of not just  giving admission but also prepares edoofians for the future through earn  while you learn program (EWYL) .With earn while you learn programme you just dont gain theoretical knowledge 
The earn while you learn programme makes it able for the students not to only learn theory but also they will be gaining real world experience and  the employers agree. 
The edoofa scholarship program   give expert guidance to all the students on career options, skill development, study abroad requirements and preparation with no bias on the candidate's social profile.
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you had a detailed discussion, Nigel.
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Well received, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Thank you for the information , let me go through it

16/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes I have
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes Ms Harmehak I am looking for something like this so as to reduce my parents financial burden
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Nigel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Seke 1 high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
16/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Its okay Ms Harmehak

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
17/11/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: It's great to know of your personality traits as well as skills!
17/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 532 6737: I feeh honored Ms Harmehak
17/11/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well Nigel now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
17/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 532 6737: Yes its a life changing decision
17/11/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Very well, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
17/11/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 532 6737: I will definitely add that Ms Harmehak
17/11/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
17/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 532 6737: My parents are aware of my plans to study abroad and my parents will support me
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Nigel.
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
17/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I am very confident Ms Harmehak ,I will pass my A-level with flying colors
17/11/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great
17/11/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
17/11/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak added +263 71 480 2839
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak removed +263 71 480 2839
17/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 532 6737: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: I await the response to the remaining part.
17/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay
17/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I am motivated to study engineering because I get a chance to improve the world
It feels really wonderful when you know that you are actually positively contributing something to society. Words cannot describe the feeling when someone looks at a newly constructed bridge and says, “I built that bridge.” If you ever get a chance to ask an engineer about his/her work, notice how they beam with pride when talking about their contribution in creating something new, even if it is as simple as a “like” button on a website and another thing which motivates me is that you’ll be ready for any problem ,I am not saying that once you are done with the engineering degree, you will not encounter any more problems or difficulties in your life. You will. Probably even tougher than the ones faced during your degree. But at the same time, you will have acquired the skills and the confidence to deal with any kind of problem. You will know exactly how to go about it, and where to hit it. No problem – no matter how big – will seem insurmountable. In fact, you will start viewing every problem as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.I also  want to study engineering as it brings financial security .
 
If you are the kind of person who craves a lavish and exuberant lifestyle or simply longs for a better future for your kids, then engineering is for you. The majority of educational think-tanks, blogs and news portals rate engineering as one of the top-paid degree programs.  The most prominent and lucrative engineering disciplines are chemical, computer, electrical, nuclear and petroleum engineering. Average starting salaries are about US$60k, with the potential to reach US$180k as your career progresses.
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across Nigel,

I can see you are driven to the pursue a career as an Engineer.

So which field of Engineering are you particularly intrigued towards, Nigel?
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak its always been my dream to become an engineer and I am going to work very hard so that I become one
17/11/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Could you please share your sub field for Engineering?

For instance - Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer science engineering.
17/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I want to do Civil Engineering
17/11/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now let me brief you about your desired course.
17/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay go on
17/11/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
17/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I have understood the brief of my desired course which I intend to undertake
17/11/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright Then Nigel, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 532 6737: In the next 5 to 10 years ,I envision myself as a senior civil engineer , potentially taking on a leadership role in project management .I am also keen on obtaining additional certifications in sustainable design and construction to contribute more to environmentally projects .My aspiration is to become an integral part of  some company’s success story , helping the company achieve its longterm growth objectives.I am committed to continous learning and professional development to stay at the forefront of the field  and if I get into Edoofa’s program it can help me to achieve my dreams as I will provided  with higher education abroad and I believe that Edoofa will mould me so that I become the best engineer
17/11/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Nigel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
17/11/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: @263715326737
17/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes Ms Harmehak
17/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: I await your response, Nigel
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Indian Education is a unique and specialized Education system that is offered primarily to Indian students. It incorporates culturally relevant and inclusive elements not found in mainstream Education but is subject to many of the same mandates.When I researched I found out that India is the best when it comes to studying medicine and engineering
17/11/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct Nigel!
17/11/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
17/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 532 6737: My parents and I are not familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education  for an international student without any scholarship
17/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 532 6737: May you please give us information on the costs ?
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay I got it👍
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 532 6737: So if you get a scholarship instead of paying  6000-8000Usd ,you will insted pay 3000usd
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

However it can be reduced way further through the Earn While You Learn Program.
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay I understand
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

17/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 532 6737: So you can use money from  EWYL program to pay for your school fees and is it mandatory for everyone who gets the scholarship to be a part of the program
17/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I have gone through the messages Ms Harmehak
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

It's a choice.
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 532 6737: If I get the scholarship I would love to join the ewyl program as I am hardworking and I am able to complete any tasks given to me
17/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I understand
17/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: You can surely join please
17/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes I am ready
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Nigel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 532 6737: The student will end up spending 1500 to  2250
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Nigel, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Can I have more information on the eligibility check?
17/11/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: It would be an interview please
17/11/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
17/11/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay Ms Harmehak I understand what you are saying ,So for those who would have qualified they will have to pay 350 by the end of November 2023
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay I understand
17/11/23, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: It's paid after you are found eligible and in parts.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay I understand
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes I have understood
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 532 6737: So what am I supposed to ask Mrs Magwaza
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Anything that you wish to know regarding the program, their journey, her daughters.
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Okay I will ask her
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

20/11/23, 3:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
20/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 532 6737: My session with Ms Harmehak was the best and she effectively addressed all my questions
20/11/23, 4:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
20/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 532 6737: I will contact her today Mr Sahil so that she will give me more information regarding Edoofa and I will also get to know her experience and how Edoofa has changed her life
20/11/23, 5:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 71 532 6737: 6. If found eligible  for the program  you will have 7 days to pay the first part of your enrollment fee
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 532 6737: 7 Yes Mr Sahil ,I  am clear about the same
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 532 6737: Yes ,they are?
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
