As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.

20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 988 3502: No, I haven't  researched about  that yet.  If you have some links from where I get the information please kindly share
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 988 3502: Thank you so much appreciated
20/11/23, 3:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
20/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 155 6161: No
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
