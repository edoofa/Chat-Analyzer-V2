30/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 433 5747: Hie Ms  Harmehak
Sorry l couldn't join the discussion  in time due to work and network  problems 
I went through  the  discussion  you had with Tinotenda 
As a family  we are more than willing to support  Tinotenda  in his educational  endeavour.  I thought  of putting  my opinion  today as tomorrow  l will be at work by 700am and will be possibly  having network  problems
30/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 71 629 2923: They are aware of my plans and I believe they can support thus if the costs are low
31/10/23, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
31/10/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 629 2923: Morning
31/10/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Hello, I understand please
31/10/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate Tinotenda?
31/10/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 629 2923: The family members are aware of my plans and they are willing to support me but as a family we are not financially stable so if the costs of studying abroad are high financially they might fail to support
31/10/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: I understand, Tinotenda!
31/10/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in detail and how it would be made affordable too!
31/10/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
31/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 629 2923: Ok
31/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 629 2923: Ok understood
31/10/23, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, could you please share your O level results with me?
31/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 629 2923: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Duly received!
31/10/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, are you aware that we have students who would be coming to India from Shalom Academy?
31/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 629 2923: No I am not aware
31/10/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Is that exciting to know now?
31/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 629 2923: Yes it is
31/10/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: So you happened to mention there were some changes too,

May I know what exactly happened?
31/10/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 629 2923: The school moved away from where it was before towards our registration days for the exams ,so it was no longer a centre of ZIMSEC due to the movement and the school arranged for students to write their examinations at Kambarami high school
31/10/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please, I understand
31/10/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, you mentioned you wish to study Computer sciences, 

So may I know what motivates you for the same?
31/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 629 2923: As I mentioned before my strengths are in practical subjects, my brother studied computer sciences to so I also wish to do the same and lastly according to my researchs computer sciences is a highly recognized degree and there are many highly paid job opportunities for computer sciences students
31/10/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: That's great, Tinotenda

However why didn't you pursue Computer sciences in your A level as well?
31/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 629 2923: The school doesn't offer the subject
31/10/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Oh alright!
31/10/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: What made you opt for Business studies and statistics?

Are you intrigued towards these too?
31/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 629 2923: I choose BS so that I could know some principles if I am to start my own business,
I am surely interested in those subjects too
31/10/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful and well thought off, Tinotenda!

31/10/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Mr Darlington, you can acknowledge the same so that we proceed and conclude the discussion please.
31/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 527 2534: Your program is excellent,it makes life easy for parents and students
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
31/10/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Mr Darlington, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same and are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students?
31/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 527 2534: Affordability and accessibility pretty good
31/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that.

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program
31/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

31/10/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

06/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 527 2534: Following
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263785272534 @263774335747 Can you please answer using voice notes ?
06/11/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 433 5747: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 10:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/11/23, 10:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/11/23, 10:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 10:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th November 2023 for $200 and the 11th or 12th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th  of November 2023.
