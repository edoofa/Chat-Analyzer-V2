09/11/23, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: I understand please

09/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: That's great to know Gracious.
09/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Well Gracious, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Well yess. I think it is, judging on my countries economy at the moment l think studying abroad would be best
09/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: You see, Gracious, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yess thing's are very challenging this side. 
So does studying there mean that l can find an occupation in India only or l can use the certificate world wide?
09/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: The degrees are valid internationally please.
09/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!
09/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay thank you
09/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 392 7293: So can you help me in choosing the best program using my combination
09/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we would discuss the same.
09/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yess I'm very good at adapting to new environments
09/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
09/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 392 7293: My parents are aware but l don't know if they are in full support of this. We'll hear from them when they are online
09/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Soo.... What kind of program can l get?
09/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: He did happen to mention that he wishes for you to get a chance earlier today please.
09/11/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 392 7293: I'm very confident
09/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great
09/11/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: May I know what fields are you intrigued towards Gracious and what made you opt for this subject combination?
09/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Umm truth be told, this combination is very poor. I chose it because l like those subjects and l find them easier to manage
09/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 392 7293: I want to do biotechnology. Do you think it's okay??
09/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Gracious
09/11/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Let me get it evaluated and get back to you
09/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay thank you

14/11/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning Gracious

How are you doing today?
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected Gracious?

@263783927293
14/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Hi
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: How are you doing today?
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 392 7293: I'm alright how are you
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well.
14/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Are there any payments required in this program
14/11/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Gracious.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
14/11/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response Gracious!

May I know the reason behind such inactive participation?
14/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Sorry I've been very busy I'm writing exams
14/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Um no we are not familiar with it
14/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I understand
14/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay thanks
14/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Lets wait for my parents to read through this
14/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: They can surely follow once available, meanwhile we would continue so that they have a better clarity.
14/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Gracious, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay l understand
14/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Gracious, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
14/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes l agree
14/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: So now going through the same, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with providing an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yeah I relate
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/11/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I was expecting to hear from you yesterday, I am here to continue with our discussion. 

Are we good to proceed ahead?
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?

@263783927293 @263774309418
15/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Gracious?
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 392 7293: No let me go through the messages
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind such delayed participation and responses, Gracious?

Are there any doubts or queries?
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Not not at. I was at school I'm back now
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: I understand
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation for the next 30-40 minutes so that we conclude the session today.
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay sure
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Noted
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

Gracious, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Gracious, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 392 7293: 450×5
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, how much is that?
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 392 7293: 2250
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Gracious, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yeaa...
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you are following, Mr Zindi and Gracious?
15/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes l am following
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 392 7293: How can I be sure that the money will be refunded Incase I don't make it??
15/11/23, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be receiving a thorough acceptance letter via email and it would be mentioned there.

There would be an interview for your parents with the Program Director, 

Like I shared earlier with you that Edoofa is proudly associated with both your schools and you can connect with school authorities too.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes l did
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Gracious.

Do connect with Mrs Ruth to learn about their journey.
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay l will
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 392 7293: She's offline
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: You can connect once online or give a direct call in the morning too.

Feel free to ask your parents to connect with Mrs Ruth as well
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes sure
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Hey. How are you
 Lets proceed
16/11/23, 6:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
16/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes they were addressed effectively
16/11/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
17/11/23, 4:04 am - +263 78 392 7293: Yes we talked. She said that Edoofa reduced the fees she was supposed to pay since you guys offer 50% scholarship
 and that her daughters are living well in india
17/11/23, 12:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
Shall we start our today's session?
17/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Hey
17/11/23, 4:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

17/11/23, 5:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same ?
17/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Yes they are
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd November 2023 for $200 and the 22nd or 23rd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
17/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Wait... I'm still doing lower 6. So aren't you supposed to wait for my final results next year inorder for me to make all these payments ant continue with program??
17/11/23, 6:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please seat are reserved in advance .Reserved seats in advance allow you to initiate the Earn While You Learn program in your home country. This step-by-step approach provides you and your family with the opportunity to plan systematically, avoiding undue financial burdens. Over the span of approximately 20 months, engaging in projects through the EWYL program could potentially yield $50-$100 monthly. This strategic financial approach enables you to self-finance the entirety of your fees before commencing your education, thereby alleviating the financial burden on your family.
17/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 392 7293: Okay okay understooy
17/11/23, 7:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So can parents answer this .

18/11/23, 6:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let us connect again at *10:00 am CAT today* to continue the session with a fresh mind. Make sure to show your *active participation in the session* as it is an important parameter to evaluate your application.
18/11/23, 11:22 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
18/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 392 7293: I'm good how are you
18/11/23, 11:45 am - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
18/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 645 5087: That's true especially here in Zimbabwe you need even two or more years to plan for tertiary education
18/11/23, 6:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is reason why students start planning early for education abroad and no time is wasted and they get time to self finance the fees.
18/11/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 645 5087: Well I get it , it's good that the more we discuss the more I get more we information about the program
19/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let us reconvene for our session tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time with a fresh and focused mindset to continue our discussion. Your active participation in the session is an important parameter for evaluating your application.

As Psalm 119:105 says, 'Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.' Similarly, let our conversation illuminate the path to your educational journey.

27/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 645 5087: Ok get well soon
28/11/23, 10:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you
28/11/23, 10:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
28/11/23, 10:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
