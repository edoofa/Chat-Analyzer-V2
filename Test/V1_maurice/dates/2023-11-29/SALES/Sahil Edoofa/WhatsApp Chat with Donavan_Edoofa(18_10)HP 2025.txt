19/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 321 9879: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a  program which offers enrollment for African Learners to do their tertiary level of education in Indian universities. It offers starting from 50 Scholarship credits and you earn more as time goes by.  Accommodation is provided for for the first 2 years and as for transport , healthcare services and food I'm provided for by my parents. During the course there is an  earn while you learn program whereby I am attached to a certain organization where I will be working and earning more Scholarship credits
19/10/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Well received, Donavan, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/10/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
19/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 321 9879: Well noted.
19/10/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Donavan, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
19/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 321 9879: My name is Donavan Takunda Mlambo a boy aged 19.

For a career I would like to venture into engineering ( nano technology) and my second option is medicine. I like coming up with innovative projects of which I use some of these in the science exhibition competitions. At school I am part of a number of clubs and as an individual I enjoy tackling aspects which give me challenges. I am also a rugby player and my weaknesses is in athletics track events though i take part in field events. I have 3 siblings , a brother and two sisters with I being the last born in the family. My father is a taxi driver and my mother makes a living from selling vegetables and chickens. My father's highest level of education is ordinary level as well as my mother and two sisters.

19/10/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Well received Donavan, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

You have managed to share everything quite well.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 321 9879: Thank you ma'am
19/10/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Well Donavan now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
19/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I do believe it is
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
19/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I am mentally prepared
19/10/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Very well please;

I believe you must be aware that Edoofa is associated with your school and we have students who would be coming to India next year?
19/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I am well aware
19/10/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
19/10/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: You would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you accordingly please!

You would also start with the Program from Zimbabwe itself!
19/10/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/10/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I can...so how long are you given to finish a project
19/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Is it a year or...
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 321 9879: This is great
19/10/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Your mentor discusses the details and accordingly prepare your schedule which won't affect your studies.
19/10/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
19/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Noted
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Yes
19/10/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Donavan, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/10/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Yes that is right
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Please?
19/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 321 9879: If the cost is 300 per university then total becomes 1500.
If the cost is 450 then the total becomes 2250.

So taking in average the cost will be 375 giving us a total of 1875
19/10/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/10/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/10/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 321 9879: So the one for November 30 is still open right?
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 321 9879: How are payments made
19/10/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Am Sorry for delay responses my network is not doing so well
19/10/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Payments are made through online banking modes online you are found eligible and you receive an acceptance letter please.

The details are mentioned in your letter itself
19/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Indeed it is
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Very well understood
19/10/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Noted
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 321 9879: So what happens if the parents fail to meet up with the deadline
19/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I understood
19/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Noted
19/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 321 9879: The seven days mentioned
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: Your parents would be discussing everything with the Program Director please
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$750) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

19/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Very well understood
19/10/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

19/10/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
19/10/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/10/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/10/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

20/10/23, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

21/10/23, 11:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 466 6079: 1. Bachelor of technology in biomedical engineering 
2. india
3. 6000 to 8000
4. 2000 to 3000
5. 350
6. 7 days
7. Yes
21/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 466 6079: We are having network challenges
21/10/23, 1:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
21/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Well understood
21/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 466 6079: Thank you sir well understood
21/10/23, 3:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so are your parents ready for the same ?
21/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 321 9879: Yes sir they are
21/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge the same in this group using voice notes ?
21/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 466 6079: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 3:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th October 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

I doing just fine thank you.
27/10/23, 9:45 am - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the available payment modes in depth ?
27/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 321 9879: Yes sir please..
27/10/23, 9:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
27/10/23, 9:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
