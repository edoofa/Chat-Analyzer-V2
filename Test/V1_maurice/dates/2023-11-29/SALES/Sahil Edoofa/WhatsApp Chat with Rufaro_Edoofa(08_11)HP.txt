As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 612 7698: Morning Ms the person who is supposed to be responding , who happens to be my mother lives in the remote areas and network is scarce , so because of that sometimes she will not be online
09/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: That's completely alright, Rufaro.
09/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: You can continue and participate in the discussion as well.
09/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Thank you
09/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared video Rufaro?
09/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Not yet l will l promise its just that it's big so my data is limited but l will do so during offpeak
09/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
09/11/23, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Rufaro, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD First choice private charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok so l am Rufaro Mutsvandiani,  aged 17 , lower six science ZIMSEC . Learns at First Choice Private and the tuition for Zimsec students is $500 and we are allowed to pay in installments. I am studying MPC ( Maths , Physics,  Chemistry) The reason why l chose that combination is because of my love for cars which also lead me to my dream career , mechanical engineering.  The dream is of partnering with big firms like Dunlop , shells , Firestone,  etc in the production of motor parts and to also work with big brands like Toyota.  As for my combination l can't say am struggling with anything or good at anything because am still learning the topics but there is great hope of making it . As l said before l am a car lover so my hobbies are mainly based on learning more about cars and fixing small gadgets like calculators and torches.  My mother is a primary school teacher and my father is a truck driver .My mother has a degree in primary and tertiary education and my father studied mechanics
09/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Rufaro, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

It's great to interact with a student who has thorough knowledge of her dream and what she needs to pursue to study the same in the future!
09/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Thank u
09/11/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Rufaro, are you aware that Edoofa is proudly associated with your school and we have students in India and who would be coming to India from your school itself?
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 612 7698: I did not know , but now that you mentioned it , l know
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Isn't it exciting to know the same now and equally relaxing, Rufaro?
09/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 612 7698: It is exciting
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Well Rufaro now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yes l do , but l think that depends with the country . For example one can study  in China but after graduating the same person will struggle in finding a job because country like China do not accommodate us in terms of working there
09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Very addressed, Rufaro!

However are you aware that with Edoofa you can only study in India please?
09/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Oooh l did not know
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Did you read the information regarding the program please?
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Rufaro, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Munyaradzi!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 612 7698: No l thought it was meant for parents to read
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please.
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: You can address the same and also go through the same information regarding the program that I shared earlier.
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok so it's a scholarship program based in many countries in the SAAR but with its HQ in India . It helps children to fulfill their dreams .It also provides financial assistance and access to top notch institutions globally <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Very correct Rufaro!
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: You see here in India, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.

Which we will also discuss in detail as we proceed.
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 612 7698: So how does Edoofa operates
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your query, Rufaro?

As to the context that you are referring to?
09/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 612 7698: What does it take to have the scholarship
09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in the counseling session itself please!
09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Rufaro would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yaah l would like to think so
09/11/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful Rufaro,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
09/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok my mama is 570 km from here so will tell here wen she gets in touch
09/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Rufaro.

However did you happen to discuss your plans with your parents earlier?
09/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yes , they said as long as their able to afford it l will go
09/11/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Rufaro!
09/11/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok thank you
09/11/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

So Rufaro, since you mentioned your interests in Mechanical Engineering, now let me brief you about your desired course.

You can go through the same and inform me once you have followed please.
09/11/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

09/11/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
09/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yes
09/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright Rufaro, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Moving ahead do ensure active participation, Rufaro.
09/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok so next year l will be writing my final a level exams
09/11/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, the questions are regarding once you start your Bachelors in India.
09/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 612 7698: N if l manage to get into Edoofa l will use the opportunity to explore more about engines so as business in India because the dream is not all about having a degree but working. So l will like to have my own auto spare company and a car wash
09/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Rufaro, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Because of our countries financial issue l feel like abroad l will be able to save money and do something sensible
09/11/23, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: You see, Rufaro, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yaah
09/11/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Rufaro.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
09/11/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Rufaro.
09/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 612 7698: It has one of the best educations
09/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: Very correct

09/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Rufaro.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
09/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Nope
09/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

09/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Rufaro?
09/11/23, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 11:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok but l will at school so if lm not online it means l am in a lesson
09/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 612 7698: This is good
10/11/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
10/11/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

If your parent is available they can continue as well meanwhile.
10/11/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: In simple words Rufaro, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Good morning
10/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Ok understood
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Rufaro, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
10/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 612 7698: That's true
10/11/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Rufaro?
10/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yes
10/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
10/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
10/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
10/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

10/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Thank u
10/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

How are you doing today?
14/11/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Mrs Nelly, how are you?

I hope you have been following the discussion?
14/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 564 0557: I'm fyn
14/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Thats good!
14/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Yes I'm following it's only that sometimes at work I really find time to use my phone
14/11/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!
14/11/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 15 minutes itself.

Are you ready?
14/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Yes
14/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Nelly, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
14/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 564 0557: $1500-$2250
14/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
14/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Nelly, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Yes it is
14/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
14/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Noted
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now Rufaro? <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: @263786127698
14/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 612 7698: Yes maam
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

15/11/23, 12:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
16/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
17/11/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
May I know what challenges are you facing?
17/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Afternoon
17/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 564 0557: Rufaro is currently in lower 6 then 2024 that's when she will finish upper 6 I think she had approached your program a bit early for her
17/11/23, 2:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: No please you have just applied on time as process of education abroad is different to process of studying in native country
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The early opening of the 2025 intake serves two important purposes:
Zimbabwean students receive their results later than other African nations. WAEC results from Ghana, Nigeria, and other Western African nations are typically declared mid-year. Malawians receive results around the same time, and Zambians receive theirs much earlier than Zimbabweans. Consequently, students from other nations may secure the majority of scholarship seats. To address this, we evaluate O-level and term results, interests, passions, career goals, extracurricular activities, achievements, and roles of responsibilities for Form 5 students applying for the Edoofa scholarship program. Additionally, we offer parents the opportunity to participate in sessions on behalf of applicants, ensuring deserving candidates don't miss out on this golden opportunity.
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
