06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: B.Sc Microbiology
*B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Thank you sir .....I'm interested in this ....

07/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 246 7421: India sir
07/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?.
07/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 246 7421: From what I read above degrees and educational achievements from India are globally recognized  so I won't face any difficulties in finding a job and pursuing my career........I may even get a chance to go to NY dream country and work there if I get enrolled in India....I have always wanted to work in the United Kingdom  so it won't be hard for me to be accepted there

I also read that Indian universities combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development and allows students chances to do projects with experts so I am sure if I learn in India I'll be a fully equipped biochemist with knowledge in both the theoretical and practical aspects
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
07/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 246 7421: No sir I'm not aware of the costs
07/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 6:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you following?
07/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir I think and hope my parents will be able to pay this half price
07/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir .....I was still at school..
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please parents have to continue the session in students absence .
07/11/23, 6:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's great to know. Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
07/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Ok sir .....noted
07/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I heard one of the students on the videos you send me talk about it but I'm not sure how that is done
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
07/11/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
07/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 222 9796: We are following....we will use between now and the end of her A level to gather enough enoformation about this alternative program as well as to determine whether we will afford the remaining fees or tuition since we have the other two children to cater for.....thank you very much for the important information....
07/11/23, 8:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Thank you sir ......
08/11/23, 11:35 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 246 7421: Im doing well sir thank you how are you
08/11/23, 1:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Noted
08/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
08/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

08/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Ok sir this seems interesting and helpful in cutting down the costs of tuition
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: yes
08/11/23, 5:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes I realize that and I think the EWYL is a very great program for both my parents and I
08/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/11/23, 6:29 am - +263 77 503 9149: I appreciate the employability through practical learning.....

Good Morning sir we have been experiencing some power outages
09/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Afternoon sir we may start
09/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir please explain
09/11/23, 1:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
09/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 246 7421: That's right sir
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
09/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 246 7421: No sir but I saw the advert for parul University saying it's about INR500  but they did not mention international students
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you apply at Parul university ?
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 246 7421: No I just saw their advertisement on Facebook and on tv
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Approximately a $100 for the 5 different colleges
09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
09/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Sorry meant 1000
09/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I'm not sure about that
09/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: They don't give any assurance and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
10/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir I believe so
10/11/23, 10:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
10/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I am fine sir....how are you
10/11/23, 3:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
10/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
10/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I only know that it's a personal statement or school application which tells admission committee  who one is and their academic interests
11/11/23, 6:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
Shall we start our today's session?
14/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Good afternoon sir ......how are you ??
We may start
14/11/23, 4:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
14/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir I understand
14/11/23, 4:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
14/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Approximately $1350 to $2000
14/11/23, 4:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
14/11/23, 4:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Ok sir noted .....Edoofa is really helpful all this for $350
14/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Ok sir noted thank you
14/11/23, 4:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
14/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I have understood that the edoofa programme has an EWYP where where students projects and they earn scholarship points and they get paid according to their consistency and this money helps to cut down the costs of tuition at the universities.


I also understood that if a student passes the phase 1 and is found to be competent they have to pay $350 dollars for seat reservation and the EWYP. 
If the student is competent and the parents cannot pay the $350 all at once they are allowed to pay $200 within the 7days and the rest will be paid over 30 days
14/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 246 7421: The $350 is the enrolment fee for Edoofa which covers Application forms , SOP, the EWYP training, VISA documentation and assistance
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
14/11/23, 5:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 246 7421: I am in stage 1 of my application...
And we have discussed upto stage 4  of the cycle
14/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
14/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir you may
14/11/23, 6:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
14/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 246 7421: Yes sir
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 503 9149: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 222 9796: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: She will commence her tertiary education after receiving her A-level results, and as a parent, careful planning for her career is crucial.
The early opening of the 2025 intake serves two important purposes:
Zimbabwean students receive their results later than other African nations. WAEC results from Ghana, Nigeria, and other Western African nations are typically declared mid-year. Malawians receive results around the same time, and Zambians receive theirs much earlier than Zimbabweans. Consequently, students from other nations may secure the majority of scholarship seats. To address this, we evaluate O-level and term results, interests, passions, career goals, extracurricular activities, achievements, and roles of responsibilities for Form 5 students applying for the Edoofa scholarship program. Additionally, we offer parents the opportunity to participate in sessions on behalf of applicants, ensuring deserving candidates don't miss out on this golden opportunity.
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Furthermore, through the Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program, Lower 6  students have a 18-20-month period to learn and earn. This substantial duration allows students to self-finance a significant portion of their fees in their home country by utilizing spare time effectively. For instance, if a student works diligently and earns $80-100 per month during the EWYL program, they can accumulate enough funds to self-finance their entire fees. This approach significantly alleviates the financial burden on their parents.
16/11/23, 12:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon

16/11/23, 6:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
17/11/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

21/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 503 9149: Good afternoon
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 222 9796: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know why are you ignoring my messages ?
21/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 222 9796: We are not ignoring you....it's only that the Child is writing exams ....and we are experiencing serious power outages...and when we come back from work we fail to connect.....coming to our issue....we fell in love with the program.  ...but we are not sure whether we will be able to raise the required finances in time.... especially if the payments are to be done this year.
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When will Panashe start Bachelors?
21/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 222 9796: 2025
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Panashe's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
21/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 222 9796: I.see...so do you mean  to say that Panashe can start the EWYL even before the journey to India....or even before admission by the University.....I think I missed something on theEWYL
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes please
21/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 222 9796: Ok sir
