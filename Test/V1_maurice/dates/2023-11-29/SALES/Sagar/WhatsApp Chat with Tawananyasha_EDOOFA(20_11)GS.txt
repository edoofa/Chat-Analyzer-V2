We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

21/11/23, 10:27 am - Sagar: Alright, so Mr.Damon, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tenzin, is that correct?

21/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 210 6209: Just litte beat
21/11/23, 10:36 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/11/23, 10:36 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/11/23, 10:36 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 210 6209: Okay noted
21/11/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: Please address this.

21/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 247 1269: Afternoon
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: Good Afternoon Tawananyasha,
Have you followed up the session till now?
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 247 1269: Yah
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Then can you please address this.
21/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 247 1269: Sorry I don't understand
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 247 1269: Yes it's true and l would be very happy if all things went well
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: Okay so Tawananyasha, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 247 1269: Yes , pretty sure
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sagar: Alright so Tawananyasha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
21/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 247 1269: First of all my name is Tawananyasha Daimon and I'm 17 years of age. I never get time to know my weakness and my strength as l relay on the solutions to the problems. I love watching football games especially the English premier league. My father is a driver and my mother is a teacher. We never get shifted because of my father's work as a driver but we rarely see him. I would prefer mechanical engineering as my field of play
21/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: So Tawananyasha, could you kindly tell me how much *Friendship high school* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
21/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 247 1269: 120 us per  term, my father  is responsible for the finance. He is a driver
21/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sagar: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?

21/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study mechanical engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
21/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 247 1269: It's about passion and dedication about the field. The way the industry is changing, it made it clear that I want to be part of the revolution
21/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
21/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 247 1269: They are already in this group but they are not available at the moment
21/11/23, 4:32 pm - Sagar: Yes I do understand that, but I am asking you that if any one of them pursued a career in this field?
21/11/23, 4:33 pm - Sagar: Well Tawananyasha, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do answer my question.

22/11/23, 10:19 pm - Sagar: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
23/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: Well, Tawananyasha, we could not have a proper conversation regarding your Application with Edoofa for the Edoofa scholarship Program as you mostly respond after my working hours which is between *7:30 AM and 4:30 PM CAT*. In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*.
