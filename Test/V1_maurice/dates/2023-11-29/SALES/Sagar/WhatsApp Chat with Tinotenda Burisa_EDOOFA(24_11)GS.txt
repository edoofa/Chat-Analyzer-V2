27/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 601 1316: Yes it is
27/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Okay so Mr.Burisa, as we start your son's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 601 1316: I think we got it all covered sir
27/11/23, 10:33 am - Sagar: Alright so Mr.Burisa, now to help your son in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know your son better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about him, his education, what he wishes to study, his strengths, his weaknesses, his hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do you parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that you have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do you specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 601 1316: Tinotenda is young teenage whose main focus is in education and sports  . At  university he wishes to study law at its best . As parent what l know as Tinotenda's strength is his ability to communicate and gathering knowledge which benefits he in his studies  and his weakness is the pride of believing in education neglecting other things besides school at life is not all about education
27/11/23, 10:47 am - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 10:48 am - Sagar: So Mr.Burisa, could you kindly tell me how much *Makumbi high school* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
27/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 601 1316: Makumbi high is a boarding school which cost 500us per term
27/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 601 1316: I and am a building constructor
27/11/23, 10:56 am - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 10:56 am - Sagar: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
