28/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 329 6228: Okay sir good morning
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Sagar: So Blessing, could you kindly tell me how much *School Name* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
28/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 329 6228: For school fees it was 420 US Dollars per term and my father supported my education
28/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes sir I hope so
28/11/23, 1:02 pm - Sagar: That is really great Blessing, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes, I am
28/11/23, 1:04 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 329 6228: It's because I expect quality education and India has a good reputation in education.
Also India has developed rapidly in the last few years so there are many many job opportunities than here in Zimbabwe
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 329 6228: I'm looking forward to using the education I have acquired in India to save my country in education through helping other students who would like to pursue a degree in BBA. I would apply knowledge of what I have learnt there to help other students to go far even to MBA.
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Blessing, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: Don’t you agree?
28/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes, I do
28/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes, it is
28/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

28/11/23, 1:37 pm - Sagar: So now Blessing, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 329 6228: How much is the school fees for Edoofa
28/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sagar: Let us be patient for some time, all your concerns related to this topic will be cleared.
28/11/23, 1:50 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 329 6228: No
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Noted
28/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sagar: In simple words Blessing what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 329 6228: No
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: Blessing, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

28/11/23, 2:23 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 2:23 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sagar: Blessing, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yesi have understood
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - Sagar: Alright Blessing, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sagar: Blessing as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 329 6228: $I500-$2250
28/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: Exactly Blessing, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Noted
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 329 6228: Yes
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sagar: Alright Blessing, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: Blessing basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: However Blessing, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
