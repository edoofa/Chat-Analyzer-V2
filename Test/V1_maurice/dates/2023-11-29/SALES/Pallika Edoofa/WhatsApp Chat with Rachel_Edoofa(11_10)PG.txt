I am *Ms. Pallika*, and am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *08:30 AM CAT tomorrow (11/10/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*
Let's have a discussion tonight. Shall we begin?
22/10/23, 7:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!

I was expecting your response, but it seems you are currently occupied, so I will have to schedule your session for Monday at *08:30 am CAT on Monday (23/10/2023)* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so I can respond in the morning. 

Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
Meanwhile, you can go through this video of an Edoofian sharing experiences. <This message was edited>

Shall we begin?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Rachel, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
