*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Tapiwanashe ?*
14/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah sure
14/11/23, 8:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Well
I understood that
* Edoofa promotes education so that quality education can be accessed by all students not just few students
* It provides affordability and employability in higher education
* I heard that it accommodates the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker 
* It helps the students from building the application, applying to colleges, training and them ready for jobs.

That is great to hear about it and the most interesting advantage of being an Edoofian is that, it offers not just affordability and accessibility to them but also employability driven by the which is a great fortune.

Yeah that's the summary of what  l understood about Edoofa Scholarship.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 598 2393: And from the facts that I stated above, l find out that it was a great opportunity to be a member of Edoofa scholarship program
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 598 2393: l also  heard that the students can also be part of EWYL where they  will be learning and performing tasks while still proceeding with their academic schedule if they want to earn more credits.
Ehh it is said that, while you will be living in India, you will be provided with dedicated Edoofa mentors who will ensure you that you have a great experience and also will train you with basic skills, provide you career guidance, and evaluating your work related to the EWYL program.
I also heard that the mentor will be there to ensure the collective growth of the Edoofa student community and will also be responsible for a weekly or monthly assessment of your attitude, behavior and discipline while you are in the school and report the results to the Edoofa Academic Board

Yeah so the EWYL program also motivated me to apply for Edoofa Scholarship Program
14/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 598 2393: I'm sorry we have a network issue here
