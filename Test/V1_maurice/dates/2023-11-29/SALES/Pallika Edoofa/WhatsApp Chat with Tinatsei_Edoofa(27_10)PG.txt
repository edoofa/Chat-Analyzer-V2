28/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 144 1291: You are welcome
28/11/23, 8:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moving forward, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Tinatsei about achieving it <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 8:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

28/11/23, 8:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting a response from you, Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT on (29/11/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)
