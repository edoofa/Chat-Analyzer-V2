I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

2 points in chem
1 point in maths
27/11/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
27/11/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 680 4673: Yes l am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 680 4673: Yes different university
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 680 4673: But not that much
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 947 0641: Oky thank you
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nyahore, I would like to know if you want to pursue sciences so, haven't you opted for Biology in A level? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 947 0641: I don't want to purse nursing
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for that, From that I meant sciences.
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 947 0641: Yes l do want to
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly, that is what I was asking as you wanted to pursue Sciences so, why haven't you pursued Biology in the A level?
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 947 0641: Because all the schools tht l was applying they were not offering me biology
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 947 0641: My network sorry
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, in that case, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, please let me know your alternate career aspirations.
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 680 4673: So far l had bio engeering as my alternative but as you said engineering you should have physics now l dnt have any alternative
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know any other field you are interested in? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 680 4673: Ummm what are other fields tht l can fit in
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your counselor, I recommend pursuing a BA in Psychology, as it closely aligns with your subjects and interests, especially your desire to help people.

So shall I explain the course in depth?
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 680 4673: Yes you may explain
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course might aligns with what you've been aiming for*
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 680 4673: It's not
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Nyahore, I understand your strong motivation to contribute to addressing the lack of medicines, especially considering your personal experience with your mom's health. While your passion leans towards pharmaceutical sciences and drug discovery, based on the available subject combination, the closest match would be pursuing a BA in Psychology. This field also allows you to make a positive impact on people's lives, albeit from a different angle. Psychology can equip you with valuable insights into understanding and helping individuals, and it might offer a fulfilling path aligned with your goals.
27/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 680 4673: Don't you have another program tht l can fit in because l never dreamt being a psychologist
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Unfortunately, based on your current subject combination, this course is the only viable option for you.
27/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 680 4673: What about agriculture
28/11/23, 12:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT on (28/11/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)
