25/09/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
25/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 492 7218: No I cannot rfie a
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/09/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 492 7218: Okey
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 492 7218: Thats good
25/09/23, 2:16 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
25/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 492 7218: Yes
25/09/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: This message was deleted
25/09/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/09/23, 3:30 pm - Tushti: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

25/09/23, 3:30 pm - Tushti: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
25/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 492 7218: I benefit more thats good programme
25/09/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: I am delighted to hear that , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/09/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/09/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/09/23, 5:39 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
26/09/23, 9:56 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

27/09/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/09/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.*
27/09/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
