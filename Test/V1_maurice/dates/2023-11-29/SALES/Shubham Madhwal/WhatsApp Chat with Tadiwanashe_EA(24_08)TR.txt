25/08/23, 3:11 pm - Tushti: Amazing Tadiwanashe, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
25/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 934 8254: No we are not
25/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Could you please enlighten us in that aspect 😊
25/08/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
25/08/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/08/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/08/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/08/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: In simple words Tadiwanashe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
25/08/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
25/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 934 8254: I understand. Yes please continue
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: Tadiwanashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: This message was deleted
25/08/23, 3:27 pm - Tushti: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

25/08/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
25/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 934 8254: I think it is a good and innovative thing to do as it brings out some hidden talents the students may have, for instance Art.

Yes it will be beneficiary as it helps me discover and explore what I am capable of 😊
25/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Thank you for the information 😊
25/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Let's continue please 😊😊😊
25/08/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: I am delighted to hear that Tadiwanshe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/08/23, 4:02 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/08/23, 4:03 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/08/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 934 8254: I have a question
25/08/23, 4:12 pm - Tushti: Yes?
25/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 934 8254: So the EWYL only has tasks in fields other than health?
25/08/23, 4:17 pm - Tushti: The Program focuses on the overall personality development of the student, and thus the fields are irrelevant
25/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Oh okay now I understand, thank you😊
25/08/23, 4:21 pm - Tushti: Alright Tadiwanashe, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
25/08/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes I now realise that thank you
25/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes they are the ones😊
25/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Pardon their absence and lack of participation in this discussion, they are out of town but as soon as they return they will be participating in our discussions in the future 😊
25/08/23, 4:28 pm - Tushti: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth? I hope they have been through our chat on this group?
25/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes I did,
25/08/23, 4:36 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
25/08/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes please
25/08/23, 4:40 pm - Tushti: Tadiwanashe, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/08/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 934 8254: That would be $1500-$2250
25/08/23, 4:42 pm - Tushti: Exactly Tadiwanashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/08/23, 4:43 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 4:43 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives th*e student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
25/08/23, 4:43 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/08/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Okay okay that is considerably low😊😊😊🤗
25/08/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: Do you agree?
25/08/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes I agree😊
25/08/23, 4:47 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/08/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Yes please.
25/08/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: Tadiwanshe, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
25/08/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: However Tadiwanashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/08/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 934 8254: If I may ask, at the beginning of the session you once mentioned that there are people who will assess and see if I am deserving the scholarship. So if I start paying does it mean I will have been approved?
25/08/23, 4:52 pm - Tushti: No, dear. You will have to appear for an Eligibility Check as well as Scholarship Test. After that IF you are selected, then you shall be required to pay the enrollment fee
25/08/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Oh okay I understand thank you 😊
25/08/23, 4:55 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
25/08/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 934 8254: No I'm not please explain it to me😊
25/08/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 934 8254: Ms Tushti I have decided to do Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology 😊
25/08/23, 4:57 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 4:58 pm - Tushti: Alright Tadiwanashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
25/08/23, 4:58 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
25/08/23, 4:58 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
25/08/23, 4:58 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
25/08/23, 5:00 pm - Tushti: Very well, I shall share the course description for your better understanding.

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Rwanda as a country is striving to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the Genocide tragedy. The Genocide in Rwanda was a traumatising experience to the People. Some of those that are considerably lucky that managed to survive the Genocide did not live long with their sanity enough to see the Rwanda being rebuilt. Sixteen years after the Genocide, some of the survivors still suffer from serious mental problems due to the traumatising experience of the Genocide. The country is striving to built health facilities to shelter and treat those survivors with mental problems. Moreover the country is striving to build hospitals and clinics to treat the sick and injured of Rwanda. Rwanda does not have adequate resources to build infrastructure such as hospitals and clinics. More importantantly, the country does not have enough health personel, the likes of doctors, nurses, and surgeons. In general Rwanda has poor health facilitiesThis is a result of the wavering and unstable economy, where there inflation rates are very high. There is high unemployment rate, hence very high crime rates. The instability of the Rwandan economy is partly due to the country's poor farm productivity as agriculture is normally one of the most contributing strongholds to boosting the country's economy. Life in Rwanda is of poor standard. Rwanda is developing so things are constantly changing faster than expected, then the future becomes uncertain and unpredictable . Life in Rwanda may be a violent one because of the constant terrorist attacks that seek to disturb the profound peace of the country. Population is rising faster than expected so the country is being pushed towards overpopulation. This is dure to the ignorance of the people about birth control methods as well as poor health facilities. There is poor sanitation in Rwanda, the people are not getting clean and treated water. Life in Rwanda is a gamble, as one might die from any disease any time. The country is doing well in trying to regain stability as it is trying to reduce the threshold of the illiterate by building educational facilities. The country is building more schools, universities, as well as hospitals and clinics. There is now access to electricity to the dwellers of Rwanda. The country's economy seems to be having a bright future as the country is united in mobilising against poverty. The country is progressing towards job creation and improved farm productivity to boost it's economy and work towards a better Rwanda. It has been the government's express policy to deliver basis services and economic growth to it's people in order to mitigate Genocide ideology. 


*SECTION 6*


I was born in Bulawayo. I grew up in Bulawayo up until I was in the first grade of my primary education. I travelled to Harare where I repeated my Pre schooling because of age. I lived in Harare with my father and my brother. By the time my mother was at Belvedere teachers college. I lived with my father and my brother from 2010 to 2013. When I was about to go into the fourth grade, my parents sent me to a boarding school in Chimanimani at a mission school called Mutambara Mission Schools for my fourth grade. I started off as one of the most intelligent in my stream. Boarding life was not easy, as there were too many bullies. I was not a fighter and I was not sure how much strength I had, I never dared to find out. I pinpointed the fact that I was good with words, so like my father always told me, "where you cannot use your strength, use your brains" I started using my mouth as my weapon. That same year when I was in fourth grade, there was a strike by the students. I was transfered to Mnene Mission in Mberengwa for my fifth grade. Like always my name was mentioned amongst the most intelligent in the stream. I had experience in boarding schools so I did not struggle much at Mnene. When I was in my sixth grade in 2016, the vice headboy of the school retired and I was chosen to hold his place until the next year. After my seventh grade results I came back to live in Bulawayo awaiting the results. I started my form 1 in 2018 at Gifford Boys High School in Bulawayo as a day scholar where I was in the first class. Gifford was known to be one of the fighting schools where the students are barbaric, violent and irrational. At Gifford I became playful, and I topped in certain few subjects. In 2020 we were screened and I was put in the sciences class for my form 3. There I met people who had very big dreams such that I myself realised that I had been too playful. Most of my playmates were drug dealers and most of them consumed drugs but I never, consumed drugs all my life. My friends loved fights with most of our rivalry schools, they enjoyed the fights. I wrote my O level results and amongst my colleagues I had the best results. After O level there was Lower six, I transfered to St Columbas High, a mission school where my results were the only thing that discouraged the teachers from not admitting me because of my former school. Some time towards the end of my Lower Six some teachers called me in and I was confused as to why they had called, nevertheless I graced them with my presence. They asked me how I had managed to be so rational, responsible and sane when I came from the school where it was thought that there were the worst characters. I told them that it's not the place that changes a person, but one must set principles to what he does, and adhere to those principles, that way one can walk through hell with a smile and show up on the other side unscathed.

11/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Yes I do have a question. How much coverage does my scholarship offer?
11/10/23, 2:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Tadiwanashe. As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, You were considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), Which will be mentioned in your acceptance letter.*

This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized your potential. I firmly believe that if students like you are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
11/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Oh thank you so much

12/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 358 5569: Is it possible to send the money directly into the program account? <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 10:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on the quesstion?
12/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 358 5569: On the Acceptance letter you gave us the bank name and account number, however we do not have that bank in Zimbabwe for a direct deposit. The question is, is there an alternative to pay directly to the account without involving Mr ShorwiKawadza? <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please surely, 
Do you have an mukkuru payment options near you?
12/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 358 5569: Yes, we do have those
12/10/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So you can use the same for the process?
12/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Oh thank you. Do we use the same account on the Acceptance letter?
12/10/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes Please!
12/10/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
12/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 239 0648: 1. Direct bank transfer to your Parent Company's account
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

14/10/23, 7:58 am - +263 71 239 0648: The Edoofians on the video seem to have adjusted quite well in a short time, this clearly suggest that the Indian Climate does not differ too much from the African climate. Despite the fact that the Edoofians have been living in India for at least over a month, they are clearly nowhere near halfway through the Indian foods in terms of trying them out. This then indicates that India has a very wide variety of different foods.
