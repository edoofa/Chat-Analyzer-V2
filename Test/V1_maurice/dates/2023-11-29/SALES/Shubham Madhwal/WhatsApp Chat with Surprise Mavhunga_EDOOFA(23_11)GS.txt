24/11/23, 8:31 am - Sagar: Greetings Everyone,

*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 380 4934: Yes, we're Mr Gurvinder
24/11/23, 8:51 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Surprise,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 380 4934: Okay Mr Gurvinder
24/11/23, 9:22 am - Sagar: Alright, so Surprise, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Lee, is that correct?
24/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 380 4934: That's true
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 581 2862: Yes
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Lee, also do tell me whether you learnt about Lee's Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I have learnt that edoofa  is an innovative program helping Africans who are interested in studying in India with quality Tertiary education. It provides guidance and counseling throughout the course of your Tertiary education. I've also learnt that students get to engage in projects that are aimed at career and skill development. The part that interested me the most are the opportunities to self sponsor in the most affordable wat possible. 
Unfortunately Lee had not yet shared his experience with the edoofa program but I'm sure he is yet to share.
25/11/23, 9:14 am - Sagar: Good Morning Surprise,
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 9:15 am - Sagar: I see you are well informed,
but let me also brief you about the program.
25/11/23, 9:15 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25/11/23, 9:15 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
25/11/23, 9:15 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25/11/23, 9:16 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 380 4934: That is very true, I'm looking forward to it
25/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: Okay so Surprise, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
25/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 380 4934: I believe I can meet both of the metrics
25/11/23, 10:17 am - Sagar: Noted.
25/11/23, 10:18 am - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: So now Surprise, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I would like to ask if career guidance and counselling that will be given will be affordable by everyone
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sagar: I am sure that this concern of your's will be automatically addressed ahead.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Thank you then I guess I no longer have any questions everything is clear
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 380 4934: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I would be unaware by now if my friend Lee had not talked about it
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sagar: Can you tell what do you know about the cost?
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 380 4934: The total cost per year: $2,800

The total cost per Semester: $900
Examination Fee per Semester: $100
Accommodation, food and other expenses per year: $800
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Sagar: Surprise, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Sagar: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I understand now
27/11/23, 3:14 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Yes, I would appreciate
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sagar: Surprise, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I see, so that's why Edoofians are so proud of it
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Very Interesting
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sagar: Yes Surprise,The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I have no doubt I will benefit.The EWYL program really boosts experience judging from the information presented
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Surprise, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 380 4934: So that means the costs can be brought down to $0.00
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Sagar: Well If you work hard enough, then yes, you can bring your tuition fees down to zero.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Well then
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 380 4934: I'm sure I would be

27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 380 4934: This answered my questions thank you
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sagar: Surprise, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Yes
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sagar: Alright Surprise, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 581 2862: Yes
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mrs.Murambiwa.
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans in depth?
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Not really
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 581 2862: My pleasure too
27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 581 2862: Yes
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 380 4934: Yes
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - Sagar: Surprise, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 380 4934: $1500 to $2250
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: Exactly Surprise, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 581 2862: $1500- $2250

27/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: However Surprise, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
