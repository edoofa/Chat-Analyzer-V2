15/11/23, 12:32 pm - +260 95 3411232: I've heard so much about the edoofa schoolarship and what it does for people like me. I actually wanted to have the opportunity to focus on studies without the burden of  excessive student loans and just have a chance to access better educational opportunities and edoofa schoolarship is one of the schoolarships that will stick with me until the end
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - +260 95 3411232: So the edoofa program is a program that gives African students the chance to study in India and attain they're desired goals
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - +260 95 3411232: And apparently it helps out make tertiary education cheaper and easier for students <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - +260 95 3411232: The best way I'd summarise the second question is by saying that the edoofa program is one that helps students in achieving quality education and alleviate  financial burden associated with pursing academic goals
15/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
15/11/23, 1:21 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes sir

15/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

15/11/23, 4:54 pm - +260 95 3411232: And how do you give out the schoolarship percentage?
What determines what percentage you get?
15/11/23, 4:56 pm - +260 95 3411232: And also what are the necessary requirements for this?
Looking at the fact that I've been shortlisted, you're saying they're over 50,000 applicants. How do I know that I'm among the 5000. And what do I do to be among them ?
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will be assisting you about the same in detail ahead
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.

Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

17/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mutale, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
17/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes sir I did
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So please share your understanding of the same!
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: So chemistry, physics and biology are needed in this field. Though In most cases math and English are also needed too 



So biology is needed because we need to understand living organisms, anatomy and physiology. 
Physics Is also applied in the various aspects of medicine including biomechanics and medical imaging 
Chemistry both organic and inorganic chemistry are crucial for understanding processes happening in the body
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Well  as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. Eligibility: As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. Length of the program: Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like
17/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology
5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics
6. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry
7. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.

18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

18/11/23, 1:46 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes affordable <This message was edited>

18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.

18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalmentsm thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - +260 95 3411232: Fascinating
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'll keep this in mind
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - +260 95 3411232: Thank you very much for the on point explanation
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 95 3411232: I find the "Earn While You Learn" aspect of Edoofa the most interesting. This innovative program not only provides valuable real-world experience but also offers students the opportunity to earn scholarship credits, reducing the financial burden of their education. It combines practical learning with financial support, preparing students for the professional world while making higher education more affordable.
18/11/23, 2:29 pm - +260 95 3411232: Additionally, the "Higher Education Concierge" service stands out as compelling. Edoofa's commitment to guiding students through every step of their higher education journey, from career selection to internships, reflects a comprehensive and supportive approach. This personalized assistance ensures that students receive the necessary guidance and support, making the entire process smoother and more accessible.
18/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
18/11/23, 2:31 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes you did
18/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
18/11/23, 2:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: Ohhh I get it now. It's actually pretty good
18/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
18/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
18/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 95 3411232: I appreciate the detailed overview. The enrollment fee seems to offer a holistic package, providing not only essential services like application assistance and visa support but also a supportive family-like environment. The inclusion of employability skills training and guaranteed scholarships further emphasizes the value Edoofa places on both personal and academic growth. It's reassuring to see such a comprehensive approach to higher education support.
18/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 95 3411232: Wow
18/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 95 3411232: Keeping this in mind sir
18/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
18/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out)
18/11/23, 2:39 pm - +260 95 3411232: . I will ensure to meet the payment within the specified 7-day period. Looking forward to being part of the program and taking advantage of the opportunities it offers.
18/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student has passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction.
18/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/11/23, 2:42 pm - +260 95 3411232: . This provides a helpful solution for managing the financial commitment. Looking forward to the opportunities ahead."
18/11/23, 2:47 pm - +260 95 3411232: I find this to be a very good idea
18/11/23, 2:53 pm - +260 95 3411232: What's next sir?
18/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
18/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund.

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
