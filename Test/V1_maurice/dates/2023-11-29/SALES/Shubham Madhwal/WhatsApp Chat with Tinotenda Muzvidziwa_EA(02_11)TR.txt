I am Tinotenda's mother.Thank you soo much for your concern over my daughter education,I really do appreciate it.As you had said that tomorrow you want to have a session her she will not be able to participate because she has exams tomorrow at 12 but her father will be available at that time.I also will be at work but if you send any questions l will  respond .
08/11/23, 12:08 pm - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
08/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Ok afternoon. I'm Tino's father l am online
08/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 300 0585: We can start
08/11/23, 12:44 pm - Tushti: @263773000585 Do answer this question
08/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 300 0585: That's very true as Tino's parents we are having difficulties in paying for their school fees and other demands. This is caused mainly by the high inflation rate which is also inconsistent. This has also caused the economy to be hostile. Sometimes we pay the fees very late and this disrupts our children's learning. They are at times chased away for none payment of fees. Somedays they go to school with their lunchboxes empty. As a self-employed father l normal get very little returns from my minial jobs that is if l manage to get one. As such their mother's incode will curter for all the expenses.
08/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 300 0585: It's very difficult to make ends meet with such a scenario. U can hardly come up with a budget for even tomorrow. The inflation rate is too high
08/11/23, 1:54 pm - Tushti: I completely understand your situation and am pleased to see that the family priortizes the children's education despite such obstacles
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: Now, may I know how the family has planned to manage the finances involved in Tinotenda's higher education abroad?
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 300 0585: As a family we have started a chicken project so as to help with costs for her further education. Still the savings are not adaquate enough since due to the hard economy we end up using some of the little savings. This with a scholarship it will  go a very long way. If Tino manages to get a scholarship, it will come as a big relief to her education and us as a family
08/11/23, 3:17 pm - Tushti: I see
08/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: However, the scholarship program would be able to reduce the fee from around $7000 to $2000 per year, would you be able to raise $2000 per year for the fee?
08/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Now if it comes out to be like that we would really appreciate it because we would be able to raise $2000 per year. So yes we can afford that.
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - Tushti: Noted
08/11/23, 5:38 pm - Tushti: Kindly share the O level and L6 term results for evaluation

09/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Firstly value of education in this country has been questionable a lot internationally due to rampant exam leakages across the country. The internation community tend to value less the education system in this country. Secondly the harsh economic environment makes learning being compromised so much. The situation has a great impact for proper learning. Thirdly the political field interferes with the education system. Thus proper learning end up being disturbed many times. As Tinotenda's parents, we support this decision.

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
10/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 300 0585: Good morning
10/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 300 0585: We are all fine and how are you?
10/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 300 0585: Oh yes we can start
10/11/23, 10:31 am - Tushti: Amazing, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
10/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 300 0585: Honestly my family and l have no idea neither do we have such information. We only heard about your scholarship.
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: In simple words @263773000585 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Indeed I can see you are quite well to the marginalized students. You are doing great to improve the education system. This scholarship is very good. I would be very happy for my child if she qualifies for this scolarship
10/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 300 0585: doing
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: I am glad you think so, Mr Muzvidziwa
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/11/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/11/23, 1:29 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Good afternoon Ms Tushti ,what a wonderful work you are doing.I simply smiled because I saw that this children are from our country and by so helping out children's you're also raising our nation with educative children's of tomorrow.
10/11/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear that
10/11/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
10/11/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: So, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/11/23, 1:52 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Yes l am connected
10/11/23, 2:04 pm - Tushti: Can you calculate the answer?
10/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 300 0585: If she applies to 4 universities that comes out to $1200-$1800
10/11/23, 2:09 pm - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/11/23, 2:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 2:09 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/11/23, 2:09 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/11/23, 2:15 pm - Tushti: Do answer!
10/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Sorry l am still going through what you have sent
10/11/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: Noted
10/11/23, 2:34 pm - Tushti: I hope you have gone through it now?
10/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 300 0585: Now if l may know, do we have to pay the application fee upfront
10/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 742 7613: I get it, meaning to say even for students for 2015 their enrollment will be this year?
10/11/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: Yes, let me explain further
10/11/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/11/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
10/11/23, 2:46 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
10/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 742 7613: I understood but as you have once said , economic instability is our challenge also --for raising $200 within 7 days will be a challenge.If I may ask when will be the counting of 7days starts?
10/11/23, 2:56 pm - Tushti: The 7 days start from the day the student gets selected into the Program
10/11/23, 2:56 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you
10/11/23, 2:56 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
10/11/23, 2:56 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/11/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/11/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/11/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tuesday at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
10/11/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

16 years after the Rwandan genocide, survivors and their families continue to present with considerable rates of anxiety symptoms. The data revealed a strong association between health problems and psychosocial factors such as social integration.

Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence.Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. Countless survivors developed long-term psychological problems.

It was found that 57.5% of the respondents had lost one or more family member during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.In this sample, 72.5% reported being traumatized, and of these, 37.5% extremely traumatized. 50% reported having sleeping problems often, and of these, 22.5% very often. 

 Despite the abundance of human and natural resources in Rwanda, a huge portion of the population still lives below the international poverty line (living on less than $2.15 a day).
15/11/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 416 6927: SECTION 6 
LIFE IN RWANDA AFTER 16 YEARS OF THE GENOCIDE

The Rwandanian genocide occured between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the civil war.During this period members of the Tutsi minority ethnic group as well as moderate hutu and tea were murded by Hutu militias.

Due to the sexual violence women suffered from thousands are now orphans and the were left to fend for themselves .The countless survivors developed long term psychological problems which affects their lives.There is also a decrease in the GDP of around 31 percent considering the people who died and those who fled the country.Opposition parties face administrative obstacles to registration and political pressure toe the government line.The Rwandan economy has registered strong post pandemic growth but was also accompanied by destic and external imbalance.In addition Rwanda has abundance of human and natural resources however a huge population still lives below the international poverty line.Poverty in Rwanda is worse especially in the rural areas where the majority of the population lives.The ruling patriotic front party contributed to dominate the country with robust authority and tight control over civil society.Thes factors along with Rwanda's weak opposition indicate that significant political and social unrest remains unlikely in the foreseeable future.The current president of Rwanda is Paul Kagame and he is the 6th president

Once again I would like to thank you for your love and concern upon Tinotenda's education  and all the effort you are giving in .Have a blessed weekend .
20/11/23, 9:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Tinotenda, Mr and Mrs Muzvidziwa  @263717317550 @263773000585 @263777427613, How are you?
20/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 742 7613: Good morning Mr Shubham,we are fine .How are you?
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263717317550 @263777427613 @263714166927 @263773000585 Are we connected?
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Yes
20/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So before we proceedd ahead are there any questions you would like to ask?
20/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 742 7613: I would like to know the  pass mark (points) which you are looking forward for Tinotenda to obtain for her final exams ?
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Yes it's true , but we shall also  try our level best to encourage her for best results .
20/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Thank you for the clarification
20/11/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are there any other questions?
20/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 742 7613: For now I think that was the question
20/11/23, 4:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So Tinotenda, your acceptance letter will be shared with you in a few moments time!
20/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Thank you
20/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 8:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Tinotenda, Mr and Mrs Muzvidziwa  @263717317550 @263773000585 @263777427613, How are you?
21/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 742 7613: Good morning Mr Shubham, we are fine thank you.How are you?
21/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 731 7550: We are good Mr Shubham and how are you?
21/11/23, 10:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great plase
21/11/23, 10:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
21/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 742 7613: Yes we are
21/11/23, 11:02 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I hope you all have gone through Tinotenda's acceptance letter?
21/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 742 7613: Yes we did
21/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 742 7613: Thank you once again
21/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 742 7613: We're are very grateful
21/11/23, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263773000585 @263777427613 . As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Tinotenda was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Tinotenda's potential. I firmly believe that if students like him/her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
21/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 742 7613: We are .short of words , but I know up there in heaven there's someone who can thank you more .We really appreciate every work you're doing for us .God bless you more
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Thank you for the kind words please
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
21/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 742 7613: We wish if we were there ,you could have seen our joy . We're so excited about this scholarship.
We have no questions but we're promising to deposit the money before end weekend.
21/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's great to hear that please, So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Tinotenda's acceptance letter?
21/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 742 7613: The first $200 by 26 November then $150  by the 26 th of December
21/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please, So are you aware of the Transaction Methods as well?
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 742 7613: Yes , I think we shall use FBC account for Mr Kawadza
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 742 7613: I think we can use mode #2
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

26/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 742 7613: Good morning Mr Shubham
26/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 742 7613: Sorry for late response was busy running around looking for money--our monthened  ends  on the 30th so we were trying to look for a loan then we will payback monthened but unfortunately they have some procedures needed to be done  for   verification, and the days last to 3days which is Tuesday because of the weekend days they do not work
26/11/23, 9:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: I understand @263777427613, however if you won't communicate with me how would I be able to understand the situation in the first place please?
26/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 742 7613: Sorry last communication was Friday and we responded.Then yesterday was Saturday we thought since it's weekend you will be not available at work
26/11/23, 9:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263777427613 what I meant was for you to share the challenge with me on Friday!
26/11/23, 9:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have shared with me, I would have helped you out. I am sure you would want me to help you out isn't it?
26/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 742 7613: Sorry we were not aware , that you would help us   .If there is another way -- we will be grateful
26/11/23, 9:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263777427613 you mentioned you have been raising a loan to complete the enrollment formalities, is that correct?
26/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 742 7613: Yes but it will be processed on Tuesday
26/11/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: I understand @263777427613, you see such kind of challenges have been faced by parents in the past as well. Now inorder to help you out, as you know today is your deadline towards completing the enrollment formalities. So I can request the Academic Board for an extension, however inorder to get the extension you would have to secure Tinotenda's admission in the first place.
26/11/23, 9:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: So if I may ask, as per your personal preparations, may I know out of $200 towards the enrollment formalities, what part of the fee have you managed to raise so far?
26/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 742 7613: $100
26/11/23, 9:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so @263777427613 so out of $200 you have raised $100 and for remaining $100 you need time till Tuesday, is that right please?
26/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 742 7613: Yes
26/11/23, 9:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright @263777427613 in that case, since today the banks would be closed, the only way you can complete a part of the formality towards Tinotenda's seat would be either through Mukuru, Ecocash or through Innbucks. May I know which mode would be convenient for you?
26/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 742 7613: It maybe okay but still there's a challenge because the loan will be processed on Tuesday time we were not given but they said they will call us ,we were thinking if you would bear with us to pay it all on Tuesday since there  is 12,5% ,to go to town today, transport is needed then on Tuesday again it's a bit challenge.
26/11/23, 9:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263777427613 let me help you have a clarity please. 12.5% transfer charge is a flat transfer charge which means even if you calculate it per transaction the total charge on $350 would be $45. 

The only reason you would have to complete a part of the enrollment formalities today is because the deadline is of today. Once you would be done with the first part of the fee, the admission would be reserved and you would have an extension as per your request.
26/11/23, 9:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: So you can complete $100 through Mukuru, Ecocash, or Innbucks today and then complete the rest on Tuesday which in total would be $100+$125 equivalent to $225.
26/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 742 7613: We will be using Mr Kawadza # isn't it ?
26/11/23, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, shall I share the details with you for Mukuru/Innbucks/Ecocash?
26/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 742 7613: It's still okay
26/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 742 7613: Mukuru doesn't open here on Sunday but inbucks

26/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 742 7613: What then will be the way forward
26/11/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263777427613 if you happen to secure the seat today, I would personally request the Academic Board to grant you an extension till Thursday i.e 30th November 2023. Incase you would face any challenges then, we can request the board to reconsider the extension and extend the same.
