God Bless You!
13/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Thank you ......
14/10/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
14/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 374 9598: Yes we can
14/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 374 9598: Mrng
14/10/23, 10:34 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
14/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 374 9598: Without a scholarship it might be too expensive for them but if it means they will pay half and the schoolarship provide half that way they manage
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: I understand
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/10/23, 11:44 am - Tushti: In simple words @263773749598 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted
14/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 374 9598: You can procced
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Tushti: Alright, let me now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Tushti: @263773749598 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/10/23, 11:58 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/10/23, 11:59 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/10/23, 12:00 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Yes l have understand the EWYL program it makes the whole process very affordable
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 374 9598: So at first how much is the student will pay
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 374 9598: To cater for the expenses when starting the program
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - Tushti: I shall explain that as we proceed @263773749598
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - Tushti: @263773749598 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 374 9598: She will spend a lot of money
14/10/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Can you calculate the amount?
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 374 9598: It's $2,250
14/10/23, 12:44 pm - Tushti: Exactly @263773749598 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/10/23, 12:45 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:45 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well understood you can procced
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: @263773749598 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted
14/10/23, 12:56 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Alright @263773749598 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Understood
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
14/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 374 9598: From the whole discussion is it that Edoofa it's an agent that help us to get through to the university of our choice or Edoofa is a University also were our students are going to be
14/10/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: Edoofa is a platform that connects you with Universities, @263773749598
14/10/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Ok.....now l understand now
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on Monday  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.*

23/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 374 9598: Wll make payment before the date 
Thank you
23/10/23, 10:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, what are the transaction methods mentioned in Whitney's acceptance letter?
23/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Paying 200usd within 7days of receiving acceptance letter and then pay $150 within 30 days using account transfer
23/10/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe (Mr NM Maphosa)

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Mode 2
23/10/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 11% at the end.
23/10/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
23/10/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $388 ($350 + $38 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore

ACC NUMBER: 5290638027654065

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664
23/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Noted this means the total amount to be paid all in all is going to be $388 USD including the charges
23/10/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I miss calculated it would be $395 with charges
23/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 374 9598: So if l paid $200 within 7days then within 30 days lw pay $195
23/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 374 9598: To make the total amount $395
23/10/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, That can be done @263773749598
23/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well noted with thanks
23/10/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
