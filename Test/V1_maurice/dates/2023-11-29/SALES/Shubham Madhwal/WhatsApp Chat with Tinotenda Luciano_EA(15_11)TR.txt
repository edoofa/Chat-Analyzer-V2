16/11/23, 6:16 am - +263 78 776 9698: I am Tinotenda Luciano Mandimutsira, a 20-year-old young man. I possess a naturally strong character, coupled with high motivation, diligence, and a strong work ethic. My affinity for computer-based professions stems from my willingness to spend entire days solving programming problems on my laptop, reflecting my passion for the field.

As the third-born in a family of four, with two unemployed forester brothers and a younger sister awaiting her grade 7 results, I recognize the responsibility and potential to positively impact my family's trajectory through my education and career choices.

Having completed my O level at Vumbunu Secondary School in 2020 with outstanding results, including top grades in 
Geography(A), 
Agriculture (A)
History (A), 
Mathematics (B), 
English (B), 
Combined Science (B) 
Shona (B)
Building technology (B) 

I pursued my A level at St Matthias Tsonzo in 2022. There, I excelled in 

Crop Science (A)
Computer Science (B)
Geography (C) 

solidifying my dream to become a network engineer.

The financial support came from my parents who are qualified teachers. They have been unwaveringly committed to funding my education, allowing me to pursue my goals. Their sacrificial investment in my A-level education at St Matthias Tsonzo, was at a cost of $120 per term, reflecting their dedication to my academic journey.

With a fervent passion for computing professions and a deep understanding of the vital role network engineering plays in our computerized world, I am poised to contribute meaningfully to the field My  hope is in turn to improve human living standards by teaching others about computers and helping African students catch up to the digital economy which is the future.
16/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 776 9698: St Matthias Tsonzo is located in Manicaland province.
16/11/23, 10:39 am - Tushti: Thank you so much for your wonderful introduction, Tinotenda. It is a pleasure indeed to learn more about you and your family. Your introduction has helped me understand you better as a person, as a student, and as a future Edoofian!
16/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 776 9698: Okay you are welcome.
16/11/23, 10:59 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
16/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 776 9698: My mother being a teacher it's very difficulty it's like fighting a forever imaging fire.
16/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 776 9698: It is being difficult though my mother is employed by the government,her meagre salary will not be adequate to finance my tertiary education.
16/11/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: I can understand. May I know how the family would manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
16/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 776 9698: I was hoping if I get a scholarship the remainder my parents are also farmers can sale their produce and also do broiler keeping.
16/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 776 9698: Also if I can also work whilst going to school I will be willing to do that inorder to help my parents.
16/11/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Well, we do provide an opportunity to earn while you learn, I am sure you would benefit from that
16/11/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: However, some contribution would have to be made by the family as well
16/11/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: May I know whether they shall be able to do so?
16/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 739 8790: Yes will do our best thank you

16/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Okay you are welcome.
16/11/23, 3:08 pm - Tushti: *B.Sc.

16/11/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Did you understand the course?
16/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Okay thank you . But I would lk to know if it is under network engineering.
16/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes i did .Thank you .
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: You would learn that as well, it would be included in your syllabus
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 776 9698: If I'm provided with this career option in 5 years time I can see myself being a leader of a successful organization.Due to our economy in Zimbabwe I would want to be an entrepreneur ,have a personal company and also helping learners especially in under privileged communities where I grew up to learn more about computers.
Since the course also offers computer maintenance I can also include that aspect in my business so that it offers a wide range of activities in the computer world.
It is my wish to be a job creator not an employee. The world is fast changing and I want to
 be able to compete with the new world which highly computerized.
I also have this view that no matter how marginalized the rural community is I would want to bring the computers to the doorstep of the remotest part of our country. 
If I get into Edoofa's program this will help me to me to make my dreams come true since my parents are facing  financial problems which can be a limiting factor for me to progress with my education.
17/11/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
17/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 776 9698: Yes we can start .
17/11/23, 10:35 am - Tushti: That is really great Tinotenda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
17/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 776 9698: Yes I'm willing to go through whatever it takes for me to achieve my goals.
17/11/23, 10:57 am - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
17/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 776 9698: The reason I'm craving to study abroad is because due to an unstable  economy in my country the standards of learning in most institution are deteriorating and at the end the courses being offered will not be marketable. For me studying abroad will also help to have exposure and since I am after computer based professions there is  need to be in a more advanced and developed country for me to gain more experience.
17/11/23, 12:07 pm - Tushti: I completely understand
17/11/23, 12:07 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

17/11/23, 12:52 pm - Tushti: Amazing Tinotenda, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
17/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 473 2114: Well well well , that's phenomenal.India is the way to go and as parents ,we will definitely do all we can to support the young man.I think we will be proud to be associated with that Indian academic adventure
17/11/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear you say that @263774732114
17/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 776 9698: I don't have any idea about the cost .All the students I talk to which are in India have scholarships
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: In simple words Tinotenda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Thank you for this information.It is so encouraging, especially where it is indicated that one can earn and learn.I know I will never disappoint if given the opportunity.
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Honestly,I think this is perfect and suits me very well.I need not to reiterate the sincere fact that l can stretch myself to my uttermost potential to achieve what I have set my mind on.I heartly embrace the Earn as you learn program as it is surely going to be my salvation
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear that
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: Tinotenda, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 776 9698: It's between $1500 and $2250
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 776 9698: For 5 universities applications.
17/11/23, 3:03 pm - Tushti: Exactly Tinotenda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 776 9698: This is amazing indeed Edoofa is making it affordable. Thank you for this information
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: Tinotenda, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes thank you I understand
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Alright Tinotenda, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Thank you I hope I will proceed through all the phases .
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Tushti: I am sure you will sail through!
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

My inspirational story 

Knowing that he had few days left to go through a stiff hundred meter race , exercising became Shaun's daily bread..

Regardless of the discouraging words from his  friends who wanted to persuade him not to indulge in the competition ,he had to exercise daily until his skin becomes salty. Challenges in life are inevitable and being defeated is optional so to him it was a time he had to prove to the world that he could do the impossible.

He had to work extra hard  on his own as if the training at school was not enough. Besides fighting to be the best, he had many eyes he wanted to prove wrong and their discouraging words were like fuel which induced more energy in his veins.He was being underrated by both students and teachers, maybe it was because Shaun was a new comer from a small rural school.He had won the zonal competition at school and this time he was going for district level.

When the great day approached he got himself prepared for the race and at first he was intimidated by other competitors since he was the shortest and smallest excerpt for  one other boy who was almost of his size. From there he only remembered kneeling down on the track lines before cruising like a bullet to the finishing line. He had a brilliant victory against all odds  trying to pull him down.

He was so pleased with the result and his discouragers celebrated with him  which became a lesson in life to me.It made me realize that those things which look like an obstacle in people's lives are actually  gifts meant to move you to a higher level.All the negative words helped him to work even more harder and this made him to have a smooth brilliant victory. 

After Shaun had won his race this  helped me to believe in myself regardless of negative words people might say.

What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there.

Since civil war and genocide left Rwanda in ruins, Rwanda has undergone a remarkable transformation and the growth rates since 1995 had an average of 8 percent annually,poverty rates have fallen , maternal and child health was improved .
 
After 16 years less than 40 percent of the population was still suffering from poverty since they had not enough equipment and resources to practice agriculture.Due to limitations of resources they could not produced adequate food for their families.

The country has certainly come further in the past 16 years after the genocide than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted.The county made a remarkable progress in terms of recovering some of the ground lost on education and health.The economy of Rwanda has undergone rapid industrialisation due to successful governmental policy .It has a mixed economy and since early 2000s ,Rwanda has witnessed an economic boom , which improved the living standards of many Rwandans.

There was rebuilt of infrastructure for example hospitals and this helped to reduce problems which there were facing like high death rate due to poor or no health facilities in  most areas of the country. They also rebuild schools and  this helped to boost their education standards as a county. Roads and bridges that had been destroyed by the war  were also reconstructed and it this helped to accelerate the rapid growth of the country due to accessibility .

Apart from  rebuilding the country, there was peace . Human rights were now being considered and it become a stable and peaceful county. Regardless of the fact that the country had deteriorated due to the attacks from the terrorist it becomes easy for the people to rebuild their country without being intimidated or terrorized.The people were now working in unity and promoting democracy. People were now able to move freely without being threatened.

Rwanda was  able to trade with other countries this boosted their industry there by strengthening their currency  and mining and industrialisation became the main pillers which hold the economy of Rwanda firm and at the other hand promoting the agriculture section so that the Rwandans would be able to proved adequate food for their families.

24/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Okay thank you sir

26/11/23, 8:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Excuse me for my delayed response I wasn't able to get back to you yesterday because of a family emergency.
26/11/23, 8:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are doing well?
26/11/23, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you have gone through the Letter of Acceptance by now, is there anything you would like to ask so far?
26/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 473 2114: Good morning sir
26/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 473 2114: Yes, we have gone through the letter and have understood it well
26/11/23, 9:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: That is great @263774732114, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
26/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 473 2114: It's a relief to learn that we can pay through Mr Kawadza's   local bank account.This makes the process much easier
26/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 473 2114: We prefer option 2
26/11/23, 9:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me brief you about it in depth please!
26/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 473 2114: Thank you sir
26/11/23, 9:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263774732114 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Shorwi's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Shorwi Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Shorwi inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

Therefore the fee can also be paid through Hartzell High School Ex Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $395 ($350 + $45 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:- <This message was edited>

26/11/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263774732114 bank charges are flat 12.5% on the transaction.

So you can deposit $200 in the first part and $195 in the second including all the charges, or else you can deposit $225 in first and $170 in the second part
26/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 473 2114: I mean 12,5 of 200
