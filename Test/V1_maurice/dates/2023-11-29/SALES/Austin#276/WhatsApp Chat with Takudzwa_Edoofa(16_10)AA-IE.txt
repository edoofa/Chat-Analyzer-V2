But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

14/11/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: That is well noted.
14/11/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
14/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok
14/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yess l am
14/11/23, 10:43 am - Arshita: That is well noted
14/11/23, 10:43 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
14/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 964 9315: I didn't apply to any university abroad
14/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 964 9315: Except for the edooofa programme
14/11/23, 10:51 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
14/11/23, 10:51 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:51 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
14/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 964 9315: Done
14/11/23, 11:00 am - Arshita: Mining is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line. 

One of the primary reasons why mining may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment. 

Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining and other professionals in the field. 

In conclusion, mining may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.
14/11/23, 11:00 am - Arshita: Same time, looking at your interest in the field of Physics and Mathematics, let me suggest you a course that helps to venture in this field and opens a lot of career opportunities

14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

14/11/23, 11:26 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ooooh that's great news ...thank you for sharing this
14/11/23, 11:32 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
14/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes l am ..
14/11/23, 11:33 am - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
14/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 964 9315: No and can you kindly share
14/11/23, 11:34 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/11/23, 11:34 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:34 am - Arshita: In simple words Takudzwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you
14/11/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
14/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 964 9315: Noo
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
14/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yess l think so
14/11/23, 11:41 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
14/11/23, 11:42 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yess l now know
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
14/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
14/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 964 9315: 1

14/11/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
14/11/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 964 9315: Father
14/11/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
14/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 964 9315: Curious to know how am l goner be whilst studying abroad and the life there ,,but also afraid
14/11/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
14/11/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
14/11/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
14/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 964 9315: Life without them is goner be but happy for me as l am going to further my studies in a reputable country of good cultures
14/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 964 9315: That's it
14/11/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
14/11/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
14/11/23, 11:54 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes that is very much correct and also not forgetting the less privileged that's has been always my dream
14/11/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
14/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes
14/11/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
14/11/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you ,,,that's very good of you
14/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 964 9315: Thank you for this wonderful time ,, my battery is running out chat later
14/11/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: We are towards the end
14/11/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: And will take only 5 more minutes
14/11/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
14/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you
14/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 964 9315: 6 l guess
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: No, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok🤦🏿‍♂️
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
14/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
14/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Yess
14/11/23, 6:42 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Arshita and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
15/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes
15/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 964 9315: Greetings to you Mr Austin it's takudzwa speaking
15/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes l had a great session with Ms Arshita
15/11/23, 11:10 am - Austin#276: It is good to connect with you today, Takudzwa

I hope you are doing well
15/11/23, 11:10 am - Austin#276: Great to know, 
May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
15/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yaah l am better and that side
15/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 964 9315: Yes l managed to discuss with my mother for now
15/11/23, 11:12 am - Austin#276: Good to know, I am very well!
15/11/23, 11:12 am - Austin#276: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
15/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok ,,,,my mother wanted to know let's say l got 6 points required for the eligibility can l get the programme which l aspire for or you the one who goner chose for me based on my points
15/11/23, 11:17 am - Austin#276: First of all, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/11/23, 11:17 am - Austin#276: We have already discussed your course based on your subjects and aspirations
15/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok
15/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 964 9315: And also she wanted to know if the whole process of application will be done online  or other parts of the application will be done through face to face method
15/11/23, 11:21 am - Austin#276: Since you are in ZImbabwe now, the process of application will be done online and our Admissions Team will be guiding you with the same
15/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you
15/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 964 9315: So till l arrive there it will be just online only
15/11/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 11:44 am - Austin#276: You are welcome!
15/11/23, 11:44 am - Austin#276: That is correct, Takudzwa
Are you having any concerns regarding the same?
15/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 964 9315: Don't you have any branch here in Zimbabwe
15/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok you may proceed
15/11/23, 11:47 am - Austin#276: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake. Moreover , we have our associates in Zimbabwe
15/11/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you

15/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 964 9315: For the enrollment fees my mother said ok but as for the cost of education l haven't told my father as he is the one who would be paying
15/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 964 9315: So after finishing my course there in India is it obvious that l am goner find work there or l am sent back home to find work here
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Sorry l got a few questions
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 964 9315: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - Austin#276: Yes please, but as per your understanding, what are the minimum points requried?
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted!
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - Austin#276: After your education, you have the liberty to choose your career. You can work or pursue Masters in India or abroad or can return back to your country
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 964 9315: 2 A level passes
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Oh OK and obviously l would pursue Masters
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 964 9315: And if you say 2 A level passes you will be meaning which grades to be specific
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - Austin#276: That is right and it means at least 2 E grades
15/11/23, 1:04 pm - Austin#276: THat is great!
15/11/23, 1:04 pm - Austin#276: This is the bare minimum and we always encourage our students to target for higher to achieve higher scholarship quantum
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you
15/11/23, 1:28 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome!
15/11/23, 1:28 pm - Austin#276: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Austin#276: @263719649315 Takudzwa, I have been waiting for your response, are you facing any challenges?
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok sorry l will respond to you as soon as possible ..20 minutes from now
15/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Would you mind explaining to me about the education fee
15/11/23, 3:47 pm - Austin#276: *Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester.
This cost can be further reduced by her through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program
15/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you so you mean to say my school fees would range from 2000to 3000
15/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Per semester
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - Austin#276: This is the annual fees, Takudzwa not the Semester
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - Austin#276: This can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 964 9315: As you have they are 2 semester annually so that means this amount is shared among those 2 semesters
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ooh ok thank you for this
15/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok l will be willing to be enrolled in your programme
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome!
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - Austin#276: That is right!
For eg, if your cost of education is $2000 per annum, then it has to be paid in two instalments, $1000 before the first semester and $1000 before the second semester
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok thank you now l am understanding tou
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome!
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me?
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Umm l will ask if l encounter any questions for now l don't have
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
15/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 964 9315: I wanted to do mining engineering 
India
6000to8000
2000to3000
500to1000

Yes
15/11/23, 4:35 pm - Austin#276: Takudzwa, can you check your course name
15/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Mining Engineering
15/11/23, 4:36 pm - Austin#276: But I see you were offered Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering
15/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ok
15/11/23, 4:37 pm - Austin#276: Do you prefer courses in Geography more than the same?
15/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Yes
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Austin#276: So considering your interest, shall I explain you the course, *Bachelor of Arts in Geography* ?
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Don't you have another course besides that one
15/11/23, 4:46 pm - Austin#276: Apart from that , the most demanding course for you would be Computer Science Engineering itse;f
15/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 964 9315: The earn while you learn program is whereby a student works hard inorder to gain or earn scholarship credits for example he or she can earn scholarships credits of 100 in a month and this basically means he or she can earn 1200 in a year and this is then subducted from his annual fee and it is then brought down to 1800 through the scholarship credits. To add on , there is no limit to which a student can gain scholarship credits as it is based on how hard he or she works for it . Further to earn high scholarship credits a student has to be constantly in touch with their mentors for their skill development and repeatedly ask for more projects , as well as assignments to do which in return help in making more scholarship credits.
15/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Kindly asking you to explain  this  course for me
15/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 964 9315: The issue with this degree is that of finding work here in Zimbabwe when l go back home

25/11/23, 6:40 pm - Austin#276: Do you have any questions for me regarding your Acceptance Letter?
25/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Yes l do want to ask on the fees
25/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 964 9315: So this means my fees will range between 2000 to 3000 including the scholarship
25/11/23, 6:50 pm - Austin#276: That is correct, you can reduce this cost further using the Earn WHile You Learn Program
25/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ooh ok thank you
25/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Sorry for the late reply l am having a challenge with the network here
25/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 964 9315: This will be per semester right
25/11/23, 7:02 pm - Austin#276: No please, this is Per Annum!
25/11/23, 7:02 pm - Austin#276: You can pay the fee is two equal installments, each installment before a semester and there are two semesters in a year
25/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ooh ok that's great
25/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 964 9315: So how much per semester in general
25/11/23, 7:08 pm - Austin#276: It is half of the total Takudzwa, which means, $1000-$1500, this can be further reduced through your Earn While you Learn program
25/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ooh ok thank you for sharing this to me
25/11/23, 7:10 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask me?
25/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Let's say an applicant has failed to get the required points what happens......Will he still has the opportunity after rewriting his exams and pass
25/11/23, 7:17 pm - Austin#276: Let me help you with the same, as per your understanding, what are the required points for the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
25/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 964 9315: 2 A level passes
25/11/23, 7:19 pm - Austin#276: That is right!
25/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 964 9315: Ooh ok
25/11/23, 7:19 pm - Austin#276: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
25/11/23, 7:20 pm - Austin#276: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
