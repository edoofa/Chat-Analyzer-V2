To further elaborated on Edoofa program I would say that
06/10/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
06/10/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*

09/10/23, 6:44 pm - Austin#276: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Alright thank you
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - +265 992 91 36 19: Thanks
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Yes l have a question, if a student has been selected to study their so do you have your offices here in Malawi that are based with Edoofa
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Austin#276: No please, we aren't having our office in Malawi at present. Our nearest office to you is in Kitwe, Zambia. This is because we are receiving applications from 29+ countries and it would be practically challenging to set up an office at every country. Incase you have known people in Zambia, I can guide with the address and details. We have our associates in Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. You can also connect to our beneficiaries and parents from Malawi to learn their experiences and we have students who arrived recently in India for this year's intake
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Alright sir l have noted
09/10/23, 6:56 pm - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me please?

09/10/23, 6:59 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Noted
09/10/23, 6:59 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Noted too

09/10/23, 7:02 pm - Austin#276: It may seem to be a long process but you will be able to prepare well and complete them without pressure since you are having enough time and our Admissions team will be guiding you through each stage
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Alright l understand how it goes ,thank you for your brief explanation

09/10/23, 7:09 pm - Austin#276: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: Oky about t financial aspects my father is the one who will be paying
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - +265 992 91 36 19: About the financial aspects,her father will be responsible
09/10/23, 7:15 pm - +27 79 458 0805: Yes thus true I will be fitting all the bills
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted, Mr Santos and I appreciate your willingness, to support Joyce's career
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Austin#276: So Joyce, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
09/10/23, 7:22 pm - +27 79 458 0805: You welcome
09/10/23, 7:45 pm - +265 980 85 18 76: 1.Business Administration 
2.ln india
3.$6000_$8000 per annum 
4.$1250-$1500
5.The enrollment fee is $350 ,for  the first 7 days $200 is payed and the $150 remaining is payed in 30 days
6.To briefly explain my understandings on earning while learning the program  works in a way that when a student is working hard she or he is able to earn money ,the money which a student earns while learning it is contributed to the  fee that is payed per year hence this heip to reduce the cost which is payed for the student fee
7.yes l am clear with the same thing

22/10/23, 9:36 am - Austin#276: Welcome to the session, Mrs Grace
22/10/23, 9:36 am - Austin#276: Are you all having any questions for me regarding the Acceptance Letter?
22/10/23, 9:39 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Yes ,which bank here in Malawi are we suppose to deposit the enrollment fee?
22/10/23, 9:40 am - Austin#276: Yo can visit any of our banks in Malawi, fill out the telegraphic transfer form and deposit the amount, the transaction will be through within 2-4 days and you willl receive the SWIFT receipt
22/10/23, 9:40 am - Austin#276: With which bank are you having an Account?
22/10/23, 9:42 am - +27 79 458 0805: What about in South Africa?
22/10/23, 9:43 am - Austin#276: If you are in South Africa, you have a cheaper mode of payment
22/10/23, 9:44 am - Austin#276: Mama money is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops. 

There are two options for the same, 1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees. 

2) Otherwise, we will share the Mama Money order with you directly. You can visit nearby shops to pay the order
22/10/23, 9:50 am - Austin#276: Which option would you prefer?
22/10/23, 9:51 am - +27 79 458 0805: Last time I was today about payment has to be done within 7days.  I would rather ask for that 7days please
22/10/23, 9:57 am - Austin#276: Yes, Mr Santos, you do have 7 days for the enrollment fee payment, have you noted the due date on the Acceptance Letter?
22/10/23, 9:58 am - +27 79 458 0805: Okay I get you
22/10/23, 10:07 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Then am going to use FDH bank that's were their is mum's account
22/10/23, 10:09 am - Austin#276: Noted Joyce, the payment from South Africa would be faster and cheap when it comes to transfer charges
22/10/23, 10:15 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Oky thank you, my dad is in South Africa so he just thought of depositing the money their but due to the processes he cant manage because he's always busy so the money will be deposited here in Malawi
22/10/23, 10:22 am - Austin#276: That is alright, Joyce!
If you are using Malawian Account, you can proceed with the enrollment early to avoid forex challenges
22/10/23, 10:23 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Alright noted
22/10/23, 10:33 am - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me as of now?
22/10/23, 10:38 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Yes ,
1.after a student has graduated do you heip them in finding job opportunities ?
2.can you explain to me how a students deals with accomodation
22/10/23, 10:43 am - Austin#276: 1) Let me tell you that Edoofa isn't offering jobs directly to students. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professionals. They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills. Moreover, there would campus recruitment as well

 Once our Edoofians graduate,  they will already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally
22/10/23, 10:45 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Oky thank you sir ,l get you now
22/10/23, 10:48 am - Austin#276: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus.It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

After the University Sessions you will be given these options and can choose from them
22/10/23, 10:50 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Alright noted
22/10/23, 10:53 am - Austin#276: Did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents to learn their experiences through the Edoofa program?
22/10/23, 11:01 am - +265 980 85 18 76: Yes l did ,l managed to talk to people
