06/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Alright then
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
06/11/23, 4:37 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I honestly don't know
06/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Interesting
06/11/23, 4:47 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Yes
06/11/23, 4:53 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Please clarify something for me mr Kunal,the tuition fees is 50% to 100% scholarships right? Therefore the $2000-$3000 is a 50 percent scholarship?
06/11/23, 4:56 pm - Kunal: That is correct, Genese
06/11/23, 4:56 pm - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
06/11/23, 5:00 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I think so, through internship if I'm correct
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Alright thank you
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
06/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
06/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
06/11/23, 5:47 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Sorry for the late reply
06/11/23, 5:47 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Do you mean Webinars or EWYL
06/11/23, 5:48 pm - +27 81 212 5402: My views in terms of what? Please explain
06/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kunal: What is your views on the EWYL program after going through this?
06/11/23, 6:14 pm - +27 81 212 5402: What I like about EWYL is that it helps the students in developing their skills and will also improve their knowledge while learning, the idea of EWYL was very thoughtful this will help also at work place, edoofians will gain work experience through the EWYL program I endorse this
06/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
06/11/23, 6:18 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I have taken note of it
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
06/11/23, 6:37 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I like all the 4 points however, I chose point 4 * Higher Education Concierge
06/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

06/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - +27 61 824 9331: Good evening mr Kunal, i will
06/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
06/11/23, 6:50 pm - +27 61 824 9331: I am hopeful
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Passport, student visa, letter of acceptance from the university that will accept me
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kunal: Indeed
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kunal: *But due to the pandemic, we understand a lot of people has been affected and there was an economic depression which is why the program fee/enrollment fee is further reduced to $350*
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:15 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Alright, I have taken note of that
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Is it okay if we can proceed tomorrow if you don't mind, I have to study for a mock exam tomorrow I want to prepare
06/11/23, 7:31 pm - Kunal: I understand 
We are left with 5 minutes of session
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Alright then
06/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:42 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Stage 3 I guess
06/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Yes please
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
06/11/23, 8:04 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Oh, my bad
06/11/23, 8:09 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I have taken note of that, thank you
06/11/23, 8:10 pm - +27 81 212 5402: This message was deleted
07/11/23, 6:23 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
07/11/23, 6:23 am - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

In the explanation of Step 5 Mr Kunal mentioned that the first part of the fees will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025, does this mean my application to the Edoofa program is to enroll in 2025? Is it not for next year?
08/11/23, 12:52 pm - Austin#276: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career.
08/11/23, 12:53 pm - Austin#276: Please note that your intake is in next year but you can pay the cost of education in two equal installments, each installment before a semester and there are two semesters in a year
08/11/23, 12:53 pm - Austin#276: First installment in August 2024 and second one January 2025
08/11/23, 12:55 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Thank you
08/11/23, 12:55 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, are you having other questions for me?

08/11/23, 1:15 pm - Austin#276: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Good evening sir, my apologies for the late reply  like I mentioned earlier they do not have any problems regarding the fees, they have agreed with the amount that needs to be paid, the amount of time given for the registration fees as well as the enrollment fees is fair and manageable
Regarding the cost of education, well the Edoofa program has made the task easier by reducing the amount of fees further

09/11/23, 6:55 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
10/11/23, 6:08 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Good evening mr Austin, most of the questions asked I had discussed them with mr Kunal already
My apologies for the late reply, I have exams these days I am preparing them
10/11/23, 7:01 pm - +27 81 212 5402: 1. Computer science

2. In India

3. $6000-$8000 per year

4. $2000-$3000

5.  The Enrollment fee is $350, $200 can be completed within 7 days and the remaining $150 will be completed within the remaining 30 days

6.   My understanding on the Earn While you Learn program

The EWYL program is a Edoofa employability initiative that give students a real-time live online projects.

It enable students to gain work experience, communication skills, as well as time management skills and more

Students working at the EWYL program will be compensated for their efforts. This compensation is in the form of scholarship credit, not in cash, meaning that whatever credit I will earn in one semester as an Edoofian in the program will be used to pay off my school fees for the next semester. This makes the cost of education more affordable

The experience that I will learn in the EWYL program will be based on my performance

22/11/23, 7:58 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I have a question based on the fees account name
How is the money deposited? I am not familiar with the bank
22/11/23, 8:01 pm - Austin#276: Are you planning to make the fee payment from South Africa?
22/11/23, 8:04 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Yes I was given a certain Valerie Rubuko's number and I had spoken to her, I had asked her about it

22/11/23, 8:16 pm - Austin#276: Good to hear that!
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Austin#276: Since you are in SA, Mama money is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops. 

There are two options for the same, 1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees. 

2) Otherwise, we will share the Mama Money order with you directly. You can visit nearby shops to pay the order
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Austin#276: Are you familiar with this mode?
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - +27 81 212 5402: What about Western Union?are you familiar with it?
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I have heard of it though
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Austin#276: I will be discussing with our Accounts Team regarding the same for you
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Austin#276: Mama Money mode is easier and cheaper when compared to Wester Union where the charges are higher
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Austin#276: You can pay through nearby shops itself
22/11/23, 10:18 pm - +27 81 212 5402: I see
23/11/23, 7:47 pm - +27 81 212 5402: Good evening mr Austin, my mother suggests that you send the acceptance letter to her via her email
