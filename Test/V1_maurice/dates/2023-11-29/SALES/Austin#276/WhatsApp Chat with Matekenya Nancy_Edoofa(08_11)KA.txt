15/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 282 5441: I'm not

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

15/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 282 5441: well, I do not know
15/11/23, 3:08 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 3:08 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/11/23, 3:08 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
15/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 282 5441: sorry for the late reply
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 282 5441: I think I will be able to do it
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 282 5441: number 4
15/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

15/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 282 5441: my parents will do that
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 282 5441: they are so happy about it
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 282 5441: your passport and visa are both crucial documents to study abroad,
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 282 5441: so the deadline of 2024 to 2025 admission intake is November 30, 2023
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you the deadline will fall if you are found eligible for the program and once you receive an acceptance letter from the Board
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
15/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 282 5441: ok this understandable
15/11/23, 5:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 282 5441: I think stage 02
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 282 5441: ok go ahead
15/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 282 5441: yes  this is clear
15/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
15/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

16/11/23, 12:31 pm - +27 74 033 7139: Yes

16/11/23, 12:51 pm - Austin#276: Glad to hear that
16/11/23, 12:51 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted
16/11/23, 12:51 pm - Austin#276: @27740337139 ,May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - +27 74 033 7139: I think its fine because yesterday we have discussed about it
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Austin#276: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Austin#276: So Nancy, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 282 5441: 1. business management 
2.in India 
3.20 000 -8 00 000 it can go further to those who study engineering 
4.$300 
5.$2000 -3000 
6. EWYL  provides  opportunities to part time jobs.   you start earning on the first day and by the time you finish the degree, you not only gain theoretical but also practical knowledge. We believe higher education should not only be affordable but also be outcome-driven, opening doors for more professional opportunities.

Under EWYL, the students are required to put in extra hours after college in learning the important skills required to excel in their professional lives. When a student becomes a part of Edoofa, they graduate with not just enough knowledge about their course but also learn how to put that knowledge into use professionally.

With EWYL, students not only learn the skills but also earn for learning. The earning here is defined in terms of recommendations, scholarship credits, industrial exposure, an experience that prepares them for life after college and skills to excel during that period. Every MNC and corporate in the present times is looking for individuals who are thoroughly prepared for the challenges that professional life throws at them. All these employers seem to have a slight inclination towards students who already have a taste of the work environment and prioritize students who have acquired the required skills not only by reading about them but also sharpening them in the process
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - Austin#276: 3)The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000

4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - Austin#276: You need to address the 7th question as well
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 282 5441: yes I'm clear
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 282 5441: I understand it
16/11/23, 2:33 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:33 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:33 pm - Austin#276: Dear parent @27740337139 , Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.
16/11/23, 2:42 pm - +27 74 033 7139: I understand what you are saying  but we are waiting for the results
16/11/23, 2:42 pm - Austin#276: Are you referring to the A level results?
16/11/23, 2:44 pm - +27 74 033 7139: O level results
16/11/23, 2:54 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted and by when are you expecting the O-level results?
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - +27 74 033 7139: Let me confirm to Nancy or she can tell us ,when she expecting the results
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 282 5441: early February
16/11/23, 3:27 pm - Austin#276: That would be a long timeframe!
Please note that the intake for 2024 is already open and students are reserving their seats for the same if qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared on *7th August this year*, Malawians received their results in September, Zambians receive the results this year itself when compared to Zimbabwe O level results(January-February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. So we already have 700+ Zimbabwean students who have qualified for the next intake.
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 282 5441: we will discuss about it tonight  sir
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Austin#276: Noted and by when will you be able to share feedback with me?
