28/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 553 7483: Okay so I am Joyleen .l am social kind of person , I like to interact with different kinds of people .I am also a motivator naturally and l love nature especially the stars , reading novels as well as cooking . Something that uplifts me when I am down is music. I am not that picture perfect when it comes to school but I try my best. So on my qualifications I have  currently 3 O level subjects and I wish to re write in June next year to make them 5 .I wrote my form 6 subjects this year despite not able to attend school from June upto November because of financial issues but luckily I had already registered so I wrote Geography , Business Studies and Computer Science .And I have got a National Diploma in Digital marketing I did it with ZimSocial Consultancy Agency .So I wanted to do Event Management because l love being creative and doing something unique that exposes my creativity rather than being bored doing programming like I had thought of but I guess Event Management is ok for me as I want to be an Event planner in the future .I am so creative and innovate that out of no where I created a digital machine that l went with it to   SEIT which is Science Exhibition and Innovative Technology when I was still in ZJC I didn't win because it was on a paper but the digital tool is very mind blowing for someone of my age to think of that is what I was told by most people that I consulted and my ICT former  Teacher at Girls High School Harare was the one that motivated me not to give up  .I wouldn't create it because I didn't have enough tools cause the machine for it to build up it requires a lot plus I am not an IT engineer. I am also idealistic too . Anyways I am shy too and some times I lose myself to lack of  confidence.l love embracing technology very much .My mom is a vendor and my dad is a security guard. Ok ummm my mom has a Diploma in Theology , she used to have a decent job working in Ok Supermarket until she was involved in an accident in 2014 and got paralyzed both of her legs an she started doing vending and my dad used work at Rainbow Cinemas and he has got many Certificates  until the company shut down without notice and he started working as a Security guard
.So my big brother is a money changer , my little brother is in form 2 and the last born in form 1 .Okay so my mom was the one that was financing my school education through her compensation money that she got from the accident that she experienced until now. Okay so I had thought of doing the projects to finance myself so that I can be able to pay for my school fees. Okay so my former school was going for $250 it was Pace College in Harare Central Province
