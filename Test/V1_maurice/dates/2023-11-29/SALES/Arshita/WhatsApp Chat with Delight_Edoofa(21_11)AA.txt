22/11/23, 4:28 pm - Arshita: Please confirm me your subjects in A level.
22/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 829 6060: Okay

22/11/23, 4:32 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
22/11/23, 4:32 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 829 6060: Yes madam I'm confident enough to achieve it
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 829 6060: No l just confirmed it in the university of Zimbabwe
22/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 829 6060: Not abroad
22/11/23, 4:36 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
