09/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that you will be completing high school next year, Linda. I would like to gently inform you that embarking on an international educational journey necessitates thorough pre-planning in the lead-up to the commencement of tertiary education. This proactive approach ensures that parents are not faced with sudden financial burdens in the final moments, offering them the necessary time to accumulate funds systematically.
09/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
