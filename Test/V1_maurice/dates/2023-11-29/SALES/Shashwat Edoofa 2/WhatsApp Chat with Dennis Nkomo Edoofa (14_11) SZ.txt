16/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
16/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Goodday and thank you Sir. My name is Alvern Nkomo aged 57 and i am Dennis Nkomo's father. I am employed by National Railways of Zimbabwe as  a general labour. I earn less than US$ 200  net pay. My parrents were poor and could could not afford to send me to higher and as a result i only managed to sit for Ordinary though i was so bright. I know that education is the key to poverty eradication.

It pains me a lot to realize that Dennis Nkomo my Son has an excellent performance in almost every subject in his accademics but the challenge now is that i as the parrent i have serious shortcomings financially.At times he goes for days without enough food  since my salary is not enough to pay fees and other requirements.  In short i plead for your mercy since my Son 's performance in his education varrier is so marvellous. My Son is hard working  very humble respectiful and intelligent. He is an ardent believer in Christ since we are a Christian family. Thank you Sir.
16/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Sorry i also have his other young brother who is doing form 2  a condition that ads more weight to my miger salary    since it is the only source of funds i have.
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Sorry again i come from Zvishavane in Midlands province Sir.
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Kindly excuse me for the delay. I was in a meeting with the academic board regarding Dennis's application. Thank you for your patience.
16/11/23, 10:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 5:30 am - +263 77 337 3372: Thank you Sir

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 337 3372: Mng Sir yes i am
17/11/23, 11:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Alvern!
17/11/23, 11:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Mr. Alvern. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. I have confidence that Dennis is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance! I believe that he will act as a beacon of resilience to his peers if he capitalizes on the appropriate opportunities! So, could you kindly tell me how much *Divine Oasis Christian College* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports Dennis's education?
17/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 337 3372: Yes Sir i enjoyed viewing your wonderful education works in various places
17/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 337 3372: May God glorify your works of charity indeed its so wonderful
17/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 337 3372: At Divine Oasis College the charges per term are as follows--School fees  US$ 100  Rent US$ 50,  There is noone helping me in the family financially & i am facing seriuos challenges sourcing the funds to also carter for his other brother who sometimes gets evicted from school after i would have failed to pay for his fees in time.
17/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 337 3372: My income falls way far short of the school's requirements and as a result  he gets along without food even the family at home we end up starving
17/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Due to constraints financially at one time i had thought of transfering him to poor schools in communal areas but again when i realized his excellence performances i ended up sacrificing for the burden
17/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concerns, Mr. Alvern. Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Dennis's education abroad?
17/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 337 3372: I am afraid Sir my Son Dennis only depends on none other than me and to this effect i am pleading for financial assistance since i am responsible for his education financially unfortunately my income is too little.
17/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Alvern. *Edoofa* offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. However, after the scholarship, there is some miscellaneous amount. May I know who will be helping Dennis with that amount, please?
17/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Its me sir who will be helping Dennis but may i know how much will i be expected to folk out for miscellaneous amount.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Alvern, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Ok thank you sir
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Alvern and Mrs. Davidzo. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Dennis's well-being is truly admirable!
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Thank you Sir that is my wish if only my Son could get your attention and be enrolled in such  high schools that offers classic accademics. Indeed education is key to a bright and prosperous future.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of A level?
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Sorry Sir  at the moment i am at work at a place called Kwekwe and its far from Zvishavane my family home town,but i am going to tell Dennis to provide with the items you mentioned tomorrow mng.
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mr. Alvern. Your co-operation is highly appreciated! However, in the meantime, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous term results for evaluation in a textual format?
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Sorry the pictures are with Dennis at home and i am at work far from them but i am going to advise them to send them over to you over a telephone call.
17/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 337 3372: What actually activates to send my Son abroad for higher studies is that it is apparently known that accardemics abroad particularly from India are reguarded to be of first class and the certificate employability status. Poverty will be a thing of the past.
17/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr Alvern! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
17/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mr. Alvern. In the meantime, can you please share his previous term results?
17/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 337 3372: Thats totally marvellous and how i like it Sir,  and as for his previous term results he is going to send them tomorrow for i spoke to his mother over the phone.

17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 337 3372: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Alvern. May I know what is the year of completion of Dennis's A-Level, please?
17/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 337 3372: He is yet to enroll his lower six next year, at the moment he has just completed O- level.May be i was mistaken because i thought you also inluded A- level students am i right or otherwise
