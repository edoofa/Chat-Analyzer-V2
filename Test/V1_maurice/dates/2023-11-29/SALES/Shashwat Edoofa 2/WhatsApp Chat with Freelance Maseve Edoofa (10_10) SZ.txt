31/10/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
31/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 429 5122: Oky so how is done is it whilst am still in Zimbabwe?

03/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Freelance. I will do my utmost to explain the topic in a more straightforward manner. As previously mentioned, for pursuing a medical degree in India, appearing for NEET is a mandatory requirement. To take the NEET exam, the student will need to be physically present in the country. To facilitate this, the student must obtain a student visa, which is only granted when the student is enrolled in a university. However, since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Moreover, these courses do not require NEET! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
03/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 429 5122: Yes please
03/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are
