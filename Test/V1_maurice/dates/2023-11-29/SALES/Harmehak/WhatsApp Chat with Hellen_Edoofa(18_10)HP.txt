19/10/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: I can understand please.

So may I know how are you planning your higher education in India considering the financial support please?
19/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 021 3270: Considering the financial support l can finance my self and my mother can assist me in some challenges
19/10/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Hellen?
19/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 021 3270: What l am saying is that when l get enrolled in Edoofa scholarship l need support from you but since my parents cannot afford all financial support
19/10/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Alright, so Hellen, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 021 3270: I understand ma'am 
So a scholarship only reduces the tuition fee
19/10/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Hellen
19/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 021 3270: Noted
19/10/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries, Hellen?
19/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 021 3270: I'm done
19/10/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours for the day are over.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.
