28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Oww so the minimum number of points is 2 owk Maam

Yeah I am confident fully
28/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yah we aim for higher points and we are expecting good results
28/11/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: That's good, Great
28/11/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study BBA ?
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 081 5279: <Media omitted>
