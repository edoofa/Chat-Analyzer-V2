17/08/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct!

22/08/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/08/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/08/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Okay ma'am
22/08/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*PRECIOUS/ADITI/22AUG23*
22/08/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/08/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Okay ma'am
22/08/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
22/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Okay ma'am

22/08/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/08/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/08/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
22/08/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.

23/08/23, 3:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
23/08/23, 3:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

23/08/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, wait.
15/11/23, 4:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help to create a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) Your  journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
15/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Thank you ma'am
15/11/23, 4:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
15/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 674 4586: I will try my best to send the video by tomorrow ma'am
15/11/23, 4:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be appreciated.
15/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Okay ma'am
15/11/23, 4:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 674 4586: They say great opportunities come once in a blue moon. Well it was a great pleasure to participate in one of the remarkable moments of my life. My name is Precious Tawananyasha Nkomo a Business Administration and information technology student, a basketball player and a proud Edoofian. It is my greatest joy that I got the opportunity to participate in a basketball tournament and won a silver medal. To be honest the journey was a bit though, but my mother always reminded me that as the road gets tough you get tougher. In basketball you play as a team. Playing with my amazing team taught me team work, coordination , motivation, communication skills, confidence amongst the undying list. Hard work and dedication helped us boost our skills and morale. Time is an important factor and it has to be managed well. I can say we where able to balance our time factor. We played a lot of matches with a lot of teams and to be honest it wasn't easy. But we managed to make it to the semifinals and ended up being second. Achieving this medal is the first step to my big journey of undying achievements. It can also be you. Even if things get tough you have to go tougher to reach your goals and the standards you look forward to have. Be proud of who you are. It's when you know who you are that you can unleash your true potential and realise that it's you who defines you.  Let the world be your mirror but don't let then judge or define you. 

From a proud Edoofian. 😊 <This message was edited>

29/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 266 0479: Good day ma'am Aditi, I spoke to Precious, She highlighted that she hasn't been feeling well and she said there is a high demand of the submission of her class assessments and exams. Due to that she hasn't been able to respond in time. The time she gets home from school and her rest period are not  tallying with her normal schedule.
29/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 266 0479: I also had not been opening the messages due to pressure at work as we are preparing to close business for the upcoming festive season.  My apologies 🙏🏽🙏🏽
30/11/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good day @263772660479 
Hope you are well.

Thank you for reaching out and providing an update. I appreciate you letting me know about Precious's situation, and I hope she feels better soon. It's completely understandable that her health and academic commitments take precedence. 
Managing these responsibilities can indeed be demanding. While I appreciate your explanation, please keep in mind that effective communication is crucial, and it remains her responsibility to respond to messages, especially when it concerns academic matters.
30/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 266 0479: Good morning ma'am.  Sure, will communicate that to her
30/11/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you that would be appreciated. <This message was edited>

01/12/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As your mentor, I have always strived to ensure you get enough opportunities to self-finance your education. I have worked hard every step of the way with you to enhance your performance and skills to do well in your project opportunities. In other attempts to meet our objectives, I have always tried to have a rewarding system that helps all our Edoofians earn considerable credits that help reduce the burden of their sponsors and parents back in their home country.
01/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project. As all of you are aware the rewards/credits for this project have been revised and increased to 300$, which calls for better performance, increased effort, and a better approach to the project. Let’s learn more!
01/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The essence of honesty and transparency in communication yields the best outcomes. Grateful for your presence in India, the goal is to extend that gratitude by sharing the conveniences of your new life, such as uninterrupted electricity and nearly free internet, with your loved ones. This project aims to hone your storytelling skills, fostering confidence, creativity, empathy, and perspective, while also enhancing presentation abilities. As part of the training, you'll guide others on sharing their stories and be empowered to select community members based on readiness. Your involvement continues with the deep engagement of shortlisting applicants post-training.
01/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 674 4586: Okay ma'am
01/12/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, from now on, you won't only be a student dedicated to community building; you'll also assume the role of an Edoofa certified student leader. This means you'll have an expanded responsibility in guiding and supporting your fellow students while continuing your valuable work in the community. Your role as a student leader is a significant step forward, and we believe it will bring about positive changes in your academic journey and community impact.

Only the forms submitted by the Edoofa Certified Student Leaders will be accepted. You will be given a certificate after you successfully complete your training on this project with your mentors.
01/12/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263786744586 I hope this is clear?
01/12/23, 4:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up today's session and I expect you to be more active in our sessions.
01/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 674 4586: This is clear ma'am
