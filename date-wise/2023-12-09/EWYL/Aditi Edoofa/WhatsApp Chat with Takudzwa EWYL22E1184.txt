I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

So, are you ready to start our session?

Yes I am ready
05/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?

05/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - +91 92053 77167: The future of job placement lies on two key things:
1. *Awareness* which is to keep aware in knowledge and up to date about the things around us.
2. Skill Acquisition which has to do with developing the skills we need in order to reach our goals.

Now there are many skills which are emerging and these include digital skills or online literacy, content writing, remote team work and social media literacy. There is also a set of skills which doesn't have anything to do with technology but they are as important as ever and these include networking, business development, decision making etc.
With respect to the above mentioned skills, Eudoofa has developed some project to help Eudoofians acquire these skills whilst they get education and these projects are
1. Cooperate Alliances
2. Community Building
3. African schools education reform mission.
05/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
05/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
05/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:01 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay ma'am
05/10/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After you have gone through it I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
05/10/23, 3:02 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay understood
05/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
05/10/23, 3:08 pm - +91 92053 77167: Summary:
Objective is to gain an understanding of the market one plans to enter into after graduation.
There is need for identification of the companies first then connect with them but the easiest way can be to engage the help of immediate family members or relatives. 
LinkedIn account is needed as it is a professionally acceptable account.
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 
Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay I will
05/10/23, 3:25 pm - +91 92053 77167: To look for the best company, one must keep the following factors in consideration:
1. Nature of company- should be student centric or recreational centric or content centric.
2. Scale of Company which should not be too big neither too small
3. Financial stability
4. Background of founder

Different platforms can be used for communication with these companies and these platforms include LinkedIn, Google, Crunchbase, Instagram etc.
The steps to be followed are
1. Searching
2. Company study
3. Company Website or App study
4. Checking of Social Media Accounts
5. Gain an understanding about the founder and key partners or members 
6. Start the communication with the company
06/10/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
06/10/23, 2:30 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay understood ma'am
06/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TAKUDZWA/ADITI/6OCT23*
06/10/23, 2:37 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay✍🏽
06/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

06/10/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/10/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

09/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay understood
09/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

09/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Takudzwa, I'd like you to believe that you can generate income through these projects. We do have other ongoing projects, but eligibility for them is based on your performance in this one.

Well understood
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - +91 92053 77167: Noted
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
10/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay I will do so
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay well noted
10/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session and from now we have completed your Initial orientation sessions.
10/10/23, 3:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We will now hold our mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

2. Additionally, we'll connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

It was mind opening, encouraging and broading the picture we had about the whole Eudoofa thing. I really missed you today, as others were bragging about their mentors who were present there, and we became like orphans😅😅. Nevertheless they treated us with a good and kind atmosphere. I am geared up to earn the credits ma'am.
06/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm thrilled to hear that the orientation program was such an exciting and enriching experience for you. I apologize for not being there in person, but I'm glad to know that you felt welcomed and treated well by others. 🥺

06/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 92053 77167: I appreciate ma'am. To be honest, one thing that was not making me put more effort in earning credits was that I thought the credits are only limited to paying school fees only, but today I heard that some few students are buying laptops through the EWYL projects. It was because of my limited understanding but now I have a broader picture of the importance and benefits of this programs and how such rare opportunities are given unto us.

NOTE: This is not to be copy pasted from top to bottom. Kindly consider this as a reference material.
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: My name is ----- and I am a Proud Edoofian studying in India. I am here to help you achieve your dream of pursuing an affordable higher education in India. Being in India myself, I realize the importance of the environment that one needs to grow to be successful. As your senior/brother I am here to share with you how I made it happen for myself, why I call myself a PROUD Edoofian, and why I want my brothers and sisters to join the community and start their higher education journey. Now I know you have a lot of questions. I had mine when I was at your place. So Let us start with:
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.
4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now your task is to answer these questions then I will share the answers of the same.I hope it's clear.
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 92053 77167: Yes clear
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is really fantastic! I believe you're starting your projects with a fresh perspective and a stronger focus on getting great results. You've got what it takes, and your potential is unlimited!
And I will be waiting for your answers.
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
08/11/23, 4:26 pm - +91 92053 77167: 1. To apply for and fast track your application in the Eudoofa Scholarship program, one has to be actively in touch with the Eudoofa and attend all scheduled meetings for counciling and briefing the Eudoofa program to the applicant. This saves time and makes decisions to be made in a short time from the Eudoofa team.

2. I choose the Eudoofa program over other agents and consultants because firstly Eudoofa actively involves the student's parents in all decision making so as for them to always be in light of everything being discussed. This removes doubts of any scam that might be thought to be coming from Eudoofa, secondly it has a broad range of services offered to Eudoofians so as to make their education efficient and without problems. It provides 100% support throughout one's academic journey.

3. Eudoofa is a worldwide recognised organisation which is responsible for the success of many people around the globe. It has made education affordable to any person who is determined to archieve his or her goals in life and works hard to archieve them. Thousands and thousands of students around the world have been enrolled to different Universities and institutions around India through Eudoofa. Its uniqueness is also seen its service provision to its beloved Eudoofians. These services include mentorship, assistance in school, living in India which will be a new country to the student, skill development and also advocating for you in any kind of situation you might be facing.

4. India is a dream destination for Africans because firstly of its educational system which practicalises the theory knowledge on might have learnt so as to begin to gain experience at an early stage. Also, tge cost of living is very less, with electricity being always available 24/7 and Internet services are very cheap which is a huge advantage for a student's journey in learning.
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - +91 92053 77167: Thank you ma'am for the time.
08/11/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome
08/11/23, 4:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 5:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 92053 77167: Well, I ate sweets first and foremost. Some taste really good but some for me were very too sweet I couldn't finish them. Our landlord and his family lighted diya for us and put it in our doors and decorated the outside of the house with lights. When it was evening, we were enjoying the view of the exploding fireworks from all over the place.

20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Takudzwa, I'm interested in hearing about your experience with the webinar. What are your thoughts on the speaker, and did you find it knowledgeable?
20/11/23, 1:03 pm - +91 92053 77167: Wow
I'm glad to hear this👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽
20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm delighted to know that you're glad!
20/11/23, 1:10 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay, firstly the webinar was informative and educative, the speaker had knowledge and skills gained from both educative and experience so he was able to give pinpoint advices. 
However, there is a persistent thing that is happening in each and every webinar we have been having. The speakers arrive after around 20min which is not convenient in a way that some time the speaker then takes long to finish. Though we will be learning important things, we will be cherishing the moment, but just for professional reasons, if they can come on exact time.
Lastly, we see that all the webinars will be recorded and we have never been given any link or something to just see them that is if they are stored somewhere. If they are kept, it could be great if we are also given maybe a Google drive link or something like that. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Takudzwa, thank you for sharing your feedback and understanding of the webinar. Let me share my thoughts on them. I hope that you understand, that these are exclusive professional events that take place after a lot of efforts from the team in terms of making sure that the choice of the speaker & the topics of the session is relevant, relatable and beginner friendly. These speakers take out a couple of hours from their busy professional lives just to speak to our proud edoofians. We purposefully inform the speaker to attend a few minutes late as Mr. Anik and various mentors address the crowd on video call etiquettes and professional conversation setting so that there is no nuisance created later. I hope that you are on the same page now. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Secondly, for the webinar, your feedback is well noted. I will have this shared with Mr. Anik, he will be able to work on them. Moreover, Takudzwa, have you checked our Instagram page for the videos that we posted on the webinars that were held in the last two months?

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 92053 77167: Okay ma'am noted
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 92053 77167: The spirit of competition refers to the mindset and attitude that drives individuals or groups to strive for excellence, push their limits, and achieve their goals in a fair and respectful manner. It involves a healthy desire to improve oneself, surpass others, and contribute to the overall growth and development of a particular field or activity. The spirit of competition promotes sportsmanship, integrity, and a positive drive to excel, while respecting the rules and regulations set forth in the competitive environment.

This is what I think what the spirit of engagement is.
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 92053 77167: As for my story example: I was selected at one time to captain our school soccer team as I firmly believe that a 'competitive spirit' is a mandatory mindset when competing at such competitive events and is also a transferable skill within the team, in the way of motivating individuals to perform at the best of their abilities, increasing productivity, enhancing team morale and boosting profitability. 
I began to spent hours and hours of practising so that when the time comes for leading my team, it will be a perfect and it will produce great results. At first, it was tough because people underestimated me as some were older than me and even proposed to our soccer coach to substitute me with another captain who was older than me. But I kepting pushing, developing both my skills and my leadership abilities until everyone recognised me as a potential captain that can lead the team and take it to greater heights. Some even began a competition with me in order for them to be selected as captain but I kept on going firmly believing in myself that it was not a coincidence that I was chosen to be the one. At last, everyone acknowledged my competitiveness and they all agreed for me to be their leader. The day of the tournament finally I arrived then we played in the group stages with four other schools and we progressed to the quarter finals. We won the quarter final and semi final but unfortunately we were not able to win in the final but we had fought our way through to that height of being in the finals. And  during this experience I learnt that, when considering the key behaviours of high performance, we often think of talent, dedication, perseverance, strong work ethic, and discipline as major contributors to successful results, but all these behaviours are all included in  representation of the spirit of competition.
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 92053 77167: Pertaining to the issue of eligibility, there are a lot of Edoofians which from them only a few will be selected so as of me my honest evaluation is that I might not likely be selected based on the fact that about 70% of all Edoofians have been associated with Edoofa from a long time ago and have been doing so many tasks and even anyone so much credits and as for me I was still learning and I'm in the process of acquiring skills required for many tasks. I don't know much about the criteria that is going to be used in selected the people but based on my thinking, a lot of Edoofians are doing better than me at the moment so to fall in that top students category, there is a lesser posibility.
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @919205377167 
Hope you are well.

Your perspective on the spirit of competition is well-articulated and aligns with the positive and constructive elements it embodies. The emphasis on striving for excellence, self-improvement, and contributing to overall growth reflects a healthy and admirable approach to competition.

Competitive spirit is a catalyst for Growth and success.Competition allows an improvement in innovation,it boost economic growth as well as help one overcome challenges.

Competitive spirit helps investors to bring out new ideas as well as new methods inorder to increase sales as well as market share
ChatGPT
Absolutely, you've highlighted a fundamental aspect of competition. A competitive spirit indeed serves as a catalyst for growth and success in various domains. In the business world, competition often leads to innovation as companies strive to differentiate themselves and offer unique products or services. This not only benefits the consumers by providing them with more choices but also encourages companies to continually improve and stay relevant in the market.

Moreover, competition is integral to economic growth. When businesses compete, they are driven to operate efficiently, reduce costs, and enhance productivity. This, in turn, contributes to the overall development of industries and the economy as a whole.

In the realm of investing, competition encourages investors to seek out new opportunities and develop innovative strategies. It fosters a dynamic environment where individuals and organizations are compelled to stay ahead of the curve, adapting to changing market conditions and embracing novel ideas.

However, it's also essential to balance competition with ethical considerations and collaboration. Healthy competition promotes growth, but collaboration can lead to synergies and collective advancements. Striking the right balance ensures that the benefits of competition are harnessed without compromising on ethical standards or the greater good. What are your thoughts on how competition influences growth and success?

Absolutely, your points resonate well with the positive aspects of a competitive spirit. The drive to outperform and excel, whether in business or education, can create a culture of success that permeates various aspects of personal and professional growth. Individuals and organizations often find themselves pushing their boundaries and striving for excellence when faced with healthy competition.

Steve Jobs and Apple's success story is indeed a prime example. Jobs was known for his relentless pursuit of innovation and perfection. The competitive spirit within Apple, reflected in the development of revolutionary products like the iPhone, showcases how competition can be a powerful motivator for groundbreaking advancements.

Similarly, the competitive spirit in countries like China, especially in the fields of education and technology, has propelled them to global leadership positions. It underscores how competition can act as a driving force behind economic and technological growth.

Moreover, the resilience developed through competition is a crucial attribute. Facing challenges head-on, learning from setbacks, and continuously striving for improvement are all hallmarks of a competitive spirit. This resilience not only helps individuals and organizations overcome obstacles but also contributes to long-term success.

While competition has its undeniable merits, it's also important to balance it with collaboration and ethical considerations. Striking this balance ensures that the competitive drive remains constructive, fostering growth without compromising integrity. How do you think individuals and organizations can maintain a healthy competitive spirit while also fostering collaboration and ethical practices?

Well l am Tadiwanashe Nicole Makurumure, my long term goals are to get a masters and get a license to practice internationally, and with EWYL l know my education will be affordable and budget friendly to my parents because l will put extra effort to get as much scholarship credits as l can
ChatGPT
Hello Tadiwanashe Nicole Makurumure, it's wonderful that you have clear long-term goals for your education and career. Pursuing a master's degree and obtaining an international license are ambitious and admirable objectives. It's great that you're considering how to make your education more affordable for your parents through scholarship opportunities.

Efforts to secure scholarships demonstrate a proactive approach to managing the financial aspects of education. Many institutions and organizations offer scholarships based on academic achievements, extracurricular activities, leadership skills, and various other criteria. Putting in the extra effort to earn scholarship credits not only helps financially but also reflects your dedication and commitment to your education.

If you have specific areas of study or countries in mind for your master's program, researching scholarship options in those fields can be beneficial. Additionally, maintaining a strong academic record and actively participating in relevant extracurricular activities can enhance your scholarship prospects.

It's also a good idea to explore opportunities such as internships, research projects, or part-time work in your chosen field of study. These experiences not only contribute to your overall learning but can also make your scholarship applications more competitive by showcasing practical skills and real-world application of your knowledge.

Do you have any specific strategies or areas of focus in mind for earning scholarship credits, or are you still in the process of planning your approach?

Hello mam, my phone was being repaired I mistakenly drop it in a bucket of water
ChatGPT
Hello! I'm sorry to hear about your phone troubles. Accidents like dropping a phone in water can be quite unexpected and frustrating. Water damage can be challenging to address, but there are a few things you can try to minimize the potential impact.

Firstly, if the phone is still on, it's crucial to turn it off immediately to prevent further damage. Remove the phone from the water and dry it as much as possible with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid using heat sources like a hairdryer, as excessive heat can cause additional damage.

If possible, you may want to disassemble the phone (if you're comfortable doing so) to allow for better air circulation during the drying process. Placing the phone in a bag of uncooked rice or silica gel packets can help absorb moisture. Leave it there for at least 24-48 hours.

After this drying period, attempt to turn on the phone. If it doesn't turn on or you notice any issues, it's advisable to seek professional help or visit an authorized service center.

I hope your phone can be salvaged, and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to let me know!

From my own understanding The "spirit of competition" refers to the attitude or mindset with which people engage in competitive activities or challenging themsleves to reach certain goals  and archievement ,something that have never been done anyone . It embodies principles of fairness, respect, and sportsmanship. It's about striving to win while also acknowledging and respecting the abilities and efforts of others. In essence, it's the positive and respectful approach to competition

 This attitude of having a mindset  infuences me positively and most of the time its the reason why do not give up especially when i fail in archiving  certain goals . When ever i feel like um now giving up    , the spirit of competition always come back into mind and i start asking my self  so how did the other successful  individuals of my generation doing . In my mind i will raise a question of how did they make it up there  and these thoughts tracks me back to  my goals and the things i want to archive in my life . 

And it is this spirit of competition why i am here studying law in indai . It motivated me to take my education  internally ,to hold something bigger than just ordinary like  others . For me my passion is to do some that is recognised from the crowd .  There is a saying “If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort ,eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and your are ready for greater challenges.” And this can only be archived when one has a spirit of competition in thier mindset  giving exapmle of Elon Musk ,  and the founder of Amazon  just to mention a few .

And it is this spirit of competition why we are  here today  enjoying  this beautiful invention of technology and networks  where it is making our lives even more easier and overcome some challenges
ChatGPT
Your perspective on the "spirit of competition" is insightful and powerful. It's clear that you see competition not just as a rivalry but as a positive force that fuels personal growth and resilience. The emphasis on fairness, respect, and sportsmanship adds a dimension of integrity to the competitive mindset.

It's particularly inspiring to hear how this spirit of competition has been a driving force in your own journey, leading you to pursue education in law in India. Your commitment to aiming for something beyond the ordinary and your desire to be recognized for your contributions align with the principles of competition in a constructive and ambitious way.

The mention of successful individuals like Elon Musk and the founder of Amazon underscores how a competitive mindset, coupled with determination and continuous improvement, can lead to significant achievements. Your reference to technology and networks highlights how this spirit of competition has contributed to innovations that make our lives easier and help us overcome challenges.

Is there a specific aspect of the competitive mindset that you find most impactful in your personal and academic pursuits? And how do you think this mindset can contribute to positive changes and advancements on a broader scale?

This competitive environment propelled me to work hard, fostering a sense of determination. This commitment to giving my best allowed me to progress through the academic levels successfully, reflected in my grades. The habit of studying diligently and maintaining a strong work ethic became a norm for me, and it played a significant role in my overall success.

Looking back, I will always cherish the memories of those times when the spirit of competition pushed me to achieve my goals. It's clear to me that the competitive mindset is a valuable asset in life. It not only helps in accomplishing individual goals but also contributes to overall success and personal growth. How about you? Have you had similar experiences where the spirit of competition played a role in your achievements?

Absolutely, the spirit of competition has been a guiding force in my own journey. It embodies the drive to succeed, the pursuit of excellence, and the thrill of winning. Throughout my academic years, from primary to secondary levels, the competitive atmosphere in the classroom was a constant presence.

The spirit of competition instilled in me a strong work ethic. It pushed me to work diligently, stay focused on my goals, and fostered a sense of determination. The competition within the class motivated me to consistently strive for improvement. It wasn't just about being better than others; it was about being the best version of myself.

This mindset of embracing competition as a catalyst for personal growth stayed with me. It became a habit to normalize hard work and dedication in my studies. As a result, I successfully navigated through the academic levels, achieving success in terms of grades and personal development.

Reflecting on those times, I hold a deep appreciation for the spirit of competition. It's a powerful tool that not only propels individuals to achieve their goals but also shapes character and resilience. It's a lesson I carry with me as a mentor, encouraging others to embrace challenges, work hard, and strive for their personal best. How has the spirit of competition influenced your approach to challenges and success?

Certainly, your recognition of the spirit of competition aligns with my own experiences. As a mentor, I've seen how instilling this mindset in mentees can be a transformative force. It goes beyond just wanting to be the best; it becomes a journey of personal growth and continual improvement.

In mentoring others, I often emphasize the positive aspects of competition – the drive to succeed, the focus on personal development, and the determination to overcome challenges. Sharing personal stories, like the competitive atmosphere during my academic years, helps mentees understand that setbacks and challenges are integral parts of the journey.

Encouraging a normalized culture of hard work and dedication is a key aspect of mentoring. I find that when individuals embrace the spirit of competition, they not only achieve academic success but also develop skills and qualities that extend beyond the classroom.

Moreover, fostering a healthy competitive spirit encourages collaboration and mutual support. It's not just about outperforming others but about lifting each other up and celebrating collective achievements. This, I believe, creates a positive and empowering environment that benefits everyone involved.

As a mentor, my goal is to guide individuals in channeling the spirit of competition in a constructive way, emphasizing the values of integrity, respect, and sportsmanship. Ultimately, it's about empowering them to achieve their goals while contributing positively to the community. How do you envision incorporating the spirit of competition into your own journey and interactions with others?

As for my story example: I was selected at one time to captain our school soccer team as I firmly believe that a 'competitive spirit' is a mandatory mindset when competing at such competitive events and is also a transferable skill within the team, in the way of motivating individuals to perform at the best of their abilities, increasing productivity, enhancing team morale and boosting profitability. 
I began to spent hours and hours of practising so that when the time comes for leading my team, it will be a perfect and it will produce great results. At first, it was tough because people underestimated me as some were older than me and even proposed to our soccer coach to substitute me with another captain who was older than me. But I kepting pushing, developing both my skills and my leadership abilities until everyone recognised me as a potential captain that can lead the team and take it to greater heights. Some even began a competition with me in order for them to be selected as captain but I kept on going firmly believing in myself that it was not a coincidence that I was chosen to be the one. At last, everyone acknowledged my competitiveness and they all agreed for me to be their leader. The day of the tournament finally I arrived then we played in the group stages with four other schools and we progressed to the quarter finals. We won the quarter final and semi final but unfortunately we were not able to win in the final but we had fought our way through to that height of being in the finals. And  during this experience I learnt that, when considering the key behaviours of high performance, we often think of talent, dedication, perseverance, strong work ethic, and discipline as major contributors to successful results, but all these behaviours are all included in  representation of the spirit of competition.
ChatGPT
Your story is truly inspiring and exemplifies the essence of the spirit of competition. The dedication and hard work you put into captaining your school soccer team showcase how a competitive spirit can be a driving force behind individual and team success.

Your perseverance in the face of skepticism and the competition for the captaincy underscores the transformative power of self-belief and continuous improvement. It's impressive how you not only focused on developing your skills but also recognized the importance of leadership abilities, motivation, and teamwork.

The journey you described, from facing doubts to earning the acknowledgment and respect of your teammates, demonstrates the impact of a competitive mindset. Even though the final victory eluded you, the recognition of your competitiveness and the team's remarkable progress to the finals speaks volumes about the positive outcomes that can arise from embracing the spirit of competition.

Your concluding insight is powerful, emphasizing how key behaviors of high performance, such as talent, dedication, perseverance, work ethic, and discipline, are encompassed within the spirit of competition. It's a valuable lesson that transcends sports and can be applied to various aspects of life.

Thank you for sharing your story!
28/11/23, 8:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty in expressing your concerns, and it's completely normal to have such thoughts in a competitive environment. However, I want to encourage you to shift your perspective.
