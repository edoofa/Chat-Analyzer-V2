16/10/23, 2:51 pm - +260 97 3406177: My long term goal is to become a site engineer as I prefer getting my hands dirty as well as actually being part of creating amazing things....the EWYL program will help he gain more credit, exposure and experience as it will help me find internships that will further my engineering career
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a great long-term goal! Becoming a site engineer is a hands-on and fulfilling career choice where you can actively contribute to the creation of remarkable structures. The EWYL program is an excellent opportunity to enhance your journey. Gaining more credit, exposure, and valuable experience through internships will indeed be beneficial for your engineering career.
16/10/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 3406177: And I am looking forward to this experience
16/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 3406177: No
Would you please tell me
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/10/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 3406177: That's amazing 
When do I begin
16/10/23, 3:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Shortly Chimonga!
16/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
16/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a good session and let's make tomorrow's session more productive, and I'm looking forward to our next session.

17/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm expressing profound disappointment over your absence from our planned session today, with no prior notification. I have faith that you understand the significance of these sessions and the vital need to consistently attend them.
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - +260 97 3406177: Good evening I am truly sorry I was absent. I was study as I have an exam tomorrow and since I only got here over a week ago I've been trying to catch up
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - +260 97 3406177: Again..I am truly sorry
18/10/23, 8:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Chimoga!

18/10/23, 8:49 am - +260 97 3406177: Yes I will from now on
18/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/10/23, 9:18 am - +260 97 3406177: 😊
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you prepared for today's session?🤩
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes we are
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure. On Wednesday, I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes it does😊
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 3406177: I have revised few some parts of the documents and it sounds really life changing
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the Edoofa Hall of Inspiration? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes it really sounds amazing
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 3406177: So am I thank you again
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!

19/10/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 3406177: So this document talks about getting in touch with our local regions and telling that they can also get this great opportunity as I did if I'm correct
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, but I would appreciate a more elaborated answer.
19/10/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 3406177: So it's about telling those from my local region in secondary education that they can also get a chance to better their higher studies at scholarships for those that are less fortunate
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Right, so can you name the projects mentioned in the document?

19/10/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 3406177: So this document generally aids in how to use the LinkedIn app and how to go about on the search. Some examples are looking fie a company that's not too big or too small as well as a company with financial stability and founders mentioned on the sites
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's correct!
19/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.

20/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
20/10/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 3406177: Who I'm I suppose to add in this WhatsApp group
20/10/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will discuss this with you.
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 3406177: Okay
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/10/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 3406177: Okay
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

24/11/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 3406177: May we please reschedule as I am still working on a school project at the moment
24/11/23, 2:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Chimoga, your session has been arranged prior and you should have conveyed to me beforehnad, and it's important that you follow the schedule. Additionally, you were absent from yesterday's session.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - +260 97 3406177: And I am truly sorry for the inconvenience
24/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's okay, I hope you will be there at 6 to discuss your grant?
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 3406177: Okay
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes I am
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes I do recall
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess the remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 3406177: Yes and we are grateful this opportunity
24/11/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 3406177: I'd like that very much
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 3406177: Thank you
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 3406177: Okay

25/11/23, 4:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
25/11/23, 4:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to create a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
25/11/23, 5:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you Chimoga. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. Let me brief the call for you- 

1. From now onwards, you will get 300$ for Community building.
If a student pays enrollment fees (200$) - You will get 75$
When the student pays the remaining 100$ -  You will get 25$
When a student pays the Registration fee (School fees) - You will get 100$
When a student comes to India - You will get 100$

2. You can redeem your Scholarship credits only 2 times a year
25/11/23, 5:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also here is the Saturday Activity of the week,

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
