I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Tinevimbo* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.

26/10/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Tinevimbo and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
