01/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: *"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein*

This profound quote encourages us to see our current situation as a starting point, not a limitation. It emphasizes the limitless potential for growth, learning, and transformation, regardless of our current circumstances.

Before we delve into our session's agenda, I'd love to hear how you're doing. Your well-being is important, and I'm here to support you on your journey.
01/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 129 8755: yes im ready
01/12/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well, Done Tadiwanashe,
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️
01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE*
01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
01/12/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 129 8755: okay its fine Ms Shadra
01/12/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: ery quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
01/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 129 8755: i have low network so its still downloadingand mighty take a while
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: In this case, you can go through the audio after our session, I do not want to spend more time on this. Instead let me share the written information. We are anyway lagging behind our other peers who have already started to work on the projects.
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you have had the chance to review the EWYL document shared by the counselor, which outlines the projects you will be undertaking as part of the program. Today, I will provide detailed explanations of each project, starting with the first one: corporate alliance. The objective of this project is to gain an understanding of the market you plan to enter in the future and begin preparing for it at an early stage.

Given the global pandemic and the shift towards online work, there is a great opportunity to connect with technologically-driven and digital companies. Your task is to identify such companies within your country or region. To accomplish this, I suggest starting with your immediate network—family members, neighbors, or parents of your friends—who work in the service sector. Share your objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping you develop the necessary skills for future employability after graduation.

Additionally, I recommend creating a LinkedIn account, which is a professional networking platform. It allows you to search for companies and connect with their employees. Download the LinkedIn app from the Play Store, and I will guide you in creating your account. Through LinkedIn, reach out to managers, heads of organizations, and human resource managers, initiating conversations and gathering their contact information to set up meetings with Edoofa.

Please share the meeting details with our team, enabling us to effectively communicate and discuss the business aspects of this corporate alliance. I will provide you with a document that addresses common questions, such as the types of companies to target and how to initiate conversations with influential individuals.

Creating a LinkedIn account will expand your professional network, enhance your credibility, and increase your chances of securing internships, gaining industrial exposure, or even finding job opportunities within your country. By directly contributing to your growth and that of your country, your work will generate a significant and lasting impact.

Please feel free to ask any further questions or seek assistance along the way. Together, we can make a difference.

01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 129 8755: network is still a problem can we move an i share the understanding later
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Tadiwanshe.
Let me share the written information about this project.
01/12/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: All the Edoofians have a great sense of community building. The term community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships, and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work toward common goals. The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction, and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.

 This shared belief is the core of our second project which is community building. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoufian's educational ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. By reaching out to personal and extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them toward this opportunity.

 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others. To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary education, or are currently in the final year of senior secondary education. As a member of Team EDUFA, students will be expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization grow.

 Throughout the project, Edoofa will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts. The referral generation project for Edoofa provides students with the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by referring their personal and extended networks to the Edoofa program. For every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee, the referring student will receive $20 worth of scholarship credits. Upon completion of the admission formalities of the university,

The referring student will receive $30 worth of scholarship credits. In addition, there is an opportunity to earn an extra $5 worth of scholarship credits for every student that the Edoofa team connects with the referring student for clarification on the program.

04/12/23, 9:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/12/23, 9:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
04/12/23, 9:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
04/12/23, 9:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

05/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: "Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning." - Bill Gates

This quote by Bill Gates reminds us that challenges and feedback, even if tough, are invaluable for growth. Embracing constructive criticism turns setbacks into opportunities. Let's dive into today's session with a mindset of continuous learning and improvement.
05/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 129 8755: good morning
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?

05/12/23, 10:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Le me share the written content.
05/12/23, 10:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Alright, so let us talk about the last project which is the African school's education reform mission. This project is like our student's favorite project as it gives them an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. As part of this project, you will reach out to local schools in your region and you will and headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program.

So initially what you can do is you can make a list of all the higher secondary schools in your local area. You can start with your own school, connect with the principal of your school and you can tell them maybe over WhatsApp or a call about why you joined Edoofa in the first place. You can later tell them about how you have planned your future and then share the program details with them. After this, you could simply ask them if you would like to set up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director where both of them can explore synergies.

 After this, you can then share the contact details of the principal with your EWYL mentor in the format that shall be provided to you. As you know that in this project you have to reach out to schools and arrange a meeting between the school headmaster and the Edoofa program director,

We have tried to come up with an Edoofa cover letter that you can use to initiate a conversation with your principal or headmaster. I shall now be sending it to you after this audio. Thank you and all the best on this project.
05/12/23, 10:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you read the above information shared with you?

05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
05/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 129 8755: yes i agree
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Tadiwanashe, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."

Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
