17/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.

17/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
17/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 945 7252: Yes

I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Are you ready for it?
15/09/23, 9:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Daylan

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 1:54 am - +263 71 945 7252: Ok

27/09/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Daylan*’S EWYL journey:
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Dylan* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Dylan* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Dylan* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Dylan* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 286 9793: Thank you.  Have gone through it
27/09/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
27/09/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. 
Either you can make the decision on behalf of *Dylan*, or he/she can be active for a few minutes in the session tomorrow and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once he/she is back from school.
 Once *Dylan* is back, he/she is supposed to note a few things.
27/09/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *FIRST* - Please know that the  batch for *name’s*  sessions will be : 


*MONDAY and THURSDAY*


*SECOND* - Once the program will resume then, the timing for the sesson will be : *9:30 AM - 11:00AM*
27/09/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170


*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*
27/09/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *FIFTH* -Once the sessions are resumed then  Every day *Name*  have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
27/09/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Do let me know once you finish joinig the EWYL Line.
27/09/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay?
27/09/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *DYLAN* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
27/09/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I parent of , *<NAME>*, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME>  would like to inform you that *DYLAN* won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because of exams that start from _ to __ (date) and she/he will reach out to my mentor, *Ms. Sharda* as soon as the exams get over.


Send it to - Sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and sharda.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
27/09/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once done, please share the screenshot of the same.
27/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 286 9793: Thank you so much.  Will definitely do that
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Thank you.
28/09/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Dylan*
I hope you are doing well

Excuse me for we could not connect yesterday for our session.

Monday was a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Here is the message -
05/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!

07/12/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Dylan.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
08/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dylan
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 945 7252: Let's begin
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives.
