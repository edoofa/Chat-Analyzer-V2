04/08/23, 12:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday *Chiedza*!
How are you?

Please excuse me for the delay in my response. As many Edoofians are arriving in India, i got busy with the preparations going at the backend.
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chieza

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 2:28 am - +263 77 430 8094: Hello 

Apparently it seems we have two groups you are chatting with us and it seems the other group is lagging behind 🙈or 🤷🏾‍♀️.

May you please attend to that,or should the groups continue as two am not sure.
16/09/23, 2:40 am - +263 77 430 8094: Thank you for the above program.
But since this program was introduced at Loreto High where Chiedza is a pupil, I thought if you had to request the school head to excuse Chiedza and other such students from 0830 to 0930 on Saturday and let them use their computer lab for the sessions.That would be the best arrangement.
16/09/23, 2:44 am - +263 77 430 8094: On the second option for us parents to attend sessions mid week, am not sure if it will be a once off thing or for how long ?for planning purposes.Please enlighten because lagging behind shouldn’t be an option
20/09/23, 2:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Chiedza and parents
I hope you are doing well

I have observed you have not yet decided the timing for the session.
May I know what exactly is the challenge?
20/09/23, 6:37 am - +263 77 430 8094: Morning 
Sorry for late response was trying to work out something .The issue is we currently both are working Monday to Saturday from 7am and we are home by 2000pm.
28/09/23, 1:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Chiedza*
I hope you are doing well

Since your EWYL program has been put on hold due to your exams.
Can you let me know *when are your exams getting over so that we can resume our EWYL sessions*?

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 884 6829: Okay ma'am
07/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'
Try to answer!😄
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 884 6829: Wait ma'am let me think 😂

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."

I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
