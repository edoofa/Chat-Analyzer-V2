My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

_I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 24-08-2023 from 8:30 am to 09:30 am_, during which we can have a productive discussion.

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
29/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 462 8444: In brief the EWYLP is a program that gives the student the opportunity to work while learning by taking on various projects that equip a student with 21st century skills like marketing , blog writing amongst others . The EWYLP also effectively makes education affordable as one earns scholarship credits through hard work that can be used to reduce one's fees
29/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you
29/08/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold
29/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 462 8444: That is great I'm glad to know more
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It would be best if you allocate today's time to go through the attached document along with your family. It is essential that you read each and every detail attentively, taking your time to fully comprehend the information provided. So, are you ready for the document?
29/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I am ready

29/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you
29/08/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, I would like to inform you that during our next session, I will be available to address any questions you may have. Therefore, it would be helpful if you could take note of any queries that arise while reading the documents. This way, we can ensure that next session is both productive and tailored to your specific needs.
29/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 462 8444: I am glad to hear that ...we will go through the document and let you know if any query arise
29/08/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After you are done with the reading, I want you to answer some of my questions to the best of your ability. Our session tomorrow will provide an opportunity to discuss your responses, clarify any uncertainties, and delve deeper into the program's details.

3. What does a student’s journey look like with the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
4. Write in detail about one of the student’s testimonials.
29/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I will thank you
29/08/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 462 8444: That sounds nice and exciting😇
29/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 462 8444: I will research more thank you ..I wish you a lovely day tomorrow

01/09/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the inconvenience caused, but I must request your understanding for today. We have scheduled visits to several universities in the coming days, and an unexpected urgent meeting has arisen that requires my immediate attention. I assure you that we will make up for the missed session during our next meeting, which is scheduled for *Monday at 8:30 a.m.*

Until then, please take good care, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.
01/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay thank you
04/09/23, 12:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning,
I am delighted to share some exciting news with you. Tomorrow, we embark on a journey to visit our esteemed universities for the orientation event, a momentous occasion that fills me with great anticipation. 

As we prepare for this enriching experience, *I want to inform you that our regular sessions for the next two days will be temporarily suspended.* However, fret not; we shall resume our engaging discussions and learning on *_Thursday, the 7th of September, 2023._*
During our visit, I promise to capture moments to share with you through pictures and updates. Until then, have a splendid and productive time, dear student!
08/09/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 329 9952: Good morning. We are not ready as of now. Sharon is at school right now she will dismiss at 4pm.
08/09/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to send a mail to me stating that:

14/09/23, 8:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Sharon and Parents
How are you doing?
14/09/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I can understand but there is 3:30 hrs of time difference and till the time it is 4:00 pm in Africa, it is 7:30 pm in India. I hope you will understand.
14/09/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
14/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Greetings Ms Jasmine 
Firstly I apologize for not being available but it's beyond my control ...I am occupied a lot at school apparently since I will be sitting for my final exams in October hence there's pressure however I apologise despite for not commùnicating 

Lastly I am appealing to you to schedule all my sessions in the evening preferably all after 7 PM
15/09/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this. <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you for understanding

19/09/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
19/09/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 329 9952: Nice to meet you Ms Jasmine
19/09/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead!
19/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 329 9952: Thank you so much
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine..yes we are ready
20/09/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go through this message and answer
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I dont understand please elaborate
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I understood what you wanted me to go through but I don't really understand the two objectives
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Sharon is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
20/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I understand better now that's great and exciting
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay following
20/09/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I have connected with her before and I am glad to do so again
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Great thank you for introducing them I am looking forward to connecting with them
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Sharon to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay thank you Ms Jasmine ..may I kindly know the respective time for the sessiobs
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: There are two batches, 9:30 to 11:00 am or 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay 
I would like to inquire if you can reschedule the time whenever we cannot connect and notify you beforehabd
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me complete the introduction and then we can discuss about the timings.
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now it is time to wrap up for today. 
It was lovely talking to you.
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay thank you for the session it was also nice talking to you
23/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 462 8444: Good morning
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Greetings !
05/10/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Very well Ms Jasmine thank you for getting in touch
05/10/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sharon, May I know that are you available now?
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I am available
05/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay that's very interesting please share the newsletters
05/10/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you..Very much educative and inspirational
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 462 8444: That will be okay thank you
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
05/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Very clear 
I will get started just now
05/10/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if you are available. If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
05/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I will take option 2 is okay but may I kindly know what time
05/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sharon, Are you comfortable with sessions on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm?
05/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I was hoping you would extend to 3
05/10/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sharon, dear I hope you know that there is a 3:30 hours of time difference. 3:00 pm in Africa means 6:30 pm in India, which gets quite late for me.
05/10/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So will you be able to manage with these timings?
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay can I please connect on Fridays and Saturdays
05/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I will also be sending messages whenever I am free during the week if you are not occupied
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
