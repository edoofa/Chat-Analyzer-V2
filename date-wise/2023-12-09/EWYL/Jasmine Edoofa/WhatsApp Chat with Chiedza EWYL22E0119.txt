I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 1:49 pm - +91 90534 25286: Thank you maam
26/11/23, 3:08 am - +91 90534 25286: Good morning ma'am  
Thank you for sharing the activity. Personally, I think it's good, for people to compete, for certain reasons, for example in activities at school, or extra curricular activities as well. When I was in high school, I entered my poems in the annual Girls poet competition, and I always got a first class certificate, but to be honest, from my perspective, and my own thoughts, I didn't enter because I wanted to win or compete with other girls, I just did it for fun, and to gain experience, and if it were meant to be, to also add to the certificates I already have. Because fate decides our destiny, it's not always about the competition.  The spirit of competition, usually tends to disappoint and leads to frustration because there can only be one winner, so, I guess it's best for a person to compete with his/herself, inorder to achieve personal growth, at their own pace, rather than doing things in order to be a prize winner compared to other people.

Training is a crucial step to ensure that you can derive the maximum benefits from it. Upon completing the training, you will be recognized as a student leader, and you will be responsible for your own application forms.

Does that make sense to you?
02/12/23, 1:13 pm - +91 90534 25286: Yes ma'am, this makes sense
02/12/23, 1:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now let's delve into what your specific responsibilities will be as a *STUDENT LEADER* once the training has been completed.

02/12/23, 1:15 pm - +91 90534 25286: How long do I have to go trough these steps?
02/12/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This is the entire process Chiedza
02/12/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?
02/12/23, 1:28 pm - +91 90534 25286: Okay, i understand maam. But, How long must i take to complete the whole process?
02/12/23, 1:28 pm - +91 90534 25286: Is there a specific time frame?
02/12/23, 1:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. the more you work, the more credits you will earn
02/12/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Can we more ahead?

02/12/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When answering the questions, you can refer to the training document I've provided. Please avoid copying and pasting the same messages.

May I know that are we on the same page?
02/12/23, 1:54 pm - +91 90534 25286: Okay so I have to sort of find a way to personalize the message and not copy and paste word for word right?
02/12/23, 1:55 pm - +91 90534 25286: Yes, we are on the same page
02/12/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
