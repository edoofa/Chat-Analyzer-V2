In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 433 7203: I will try to be active
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay i understand
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay noted
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure but next week I will be starting my exams
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Alright, here's my suggestion: for this week, please plan to attend the sessions from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. Then, next week, remind me, and I will make the necessary adjustments to your session timings. Does this arrangement work for you?
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 433 7203: Yes sure
10/10/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
10/10/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/11/23, 8:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 2. 
Do you remember?
29/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes i do
29/11/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

29/11/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
29/11/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/11/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay from my understanding i have to create a group so that i can invite more people and add you so that you can track my progress
29/11/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Ashley, I am impressed with your understanding.
29/11/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay
29/11/23, 9:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session.

I hope you are doing well. 

*IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SESSION* 
So, are you ready?
30/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes
30/11/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
30/11/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay thank you
30/11/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
30/11/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 433 7203: This is a project where we reach out to schools in our region so that i can communicate with their principal to talk with the Edoofa program so that many students can be helped
30/11/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Ashley.
30/11/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

30/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay i understand

30/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. Tomorrow we will continue with Project 3. 

It was lovely talking to you. 
Have a great day ahead!
30/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 433 7203: Same to you
01/12/23, 8:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning Ashley*_
I hope you are doing. 
*This is to remind you that our session is scheduled for today starting at 8:30 am*. 
Please ensure you're punctual.
Wishing you a joyful start to the new month ahead, filled with opportunities and blessings!
01/12/23, 8:11 am - +263 78 433 7203: Thank you
01/12/23, 8:30 am - +263 78 433 7203: Good morning Ms Jasmine am ready for my session
01/12/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
01/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes i do
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
01/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
01/12/23, 8:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

04/12/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session.

06/12/23, 7:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
06/12/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure

06/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 433 7203: Yes i do
06/12/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
06/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay sure
06/12/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
06/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay I understand

07/12/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
07/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay i see <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
07/12/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
07/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 433 7203: Okay I understand
