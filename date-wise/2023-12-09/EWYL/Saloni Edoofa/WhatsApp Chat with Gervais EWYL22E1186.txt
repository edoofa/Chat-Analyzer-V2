How are you?

As a part of the Saturday activity , you are required to delve into the world of celebrity brand endorsements and analyze their significance in increasing brand growth. Focus on how celebrities function as the face of a brand and the reasons behind their effectiveness in capturing the audience's attention. Make use of the insights from the Boat case study discussed in the Wednesday lesson to strengthen your analysis. You are required to answer the 2 questions mentioned below: 

1. Explain the concept of celebrity brand endorsements and their role in marketing campaigns. Discuss how celebrities influence consumer behavior and why companies often prefer to use them as brand ambassadors.

Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.

In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about *VIDEO BLOGGING* and yes, *PROJECT UPDATES*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled video call session on Saturday. I shared the call schedule last week, along with the link, on Friday, and I expected your participation. I understand that life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges, and I'd appreciate it if you could kindly share the reason for your absence during the call. Your input is valuable to us, and we want to ensure we address any concerns or issues you might have.

16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you mentioned your reason for not attending the call on Saturday and finding it genuine, I am now sharing with you the task that was shared and that will _mark your attendance for the month of October_📆
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I have heard  that Edoofa scholarship program offers scholarships to most Africans with high quality education at an affordable cost to study in India. They also help the students to finance their scholarship since it's not a fully funded scholarship.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? The first reason  I think I should be accepted into Edoofa program is because I am eligible I have passed my MSCE with good grades which shows that I am a hard worker which also acts as an assurance that I will continue working hard.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have understood from it?
15/11/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

02/12/23, 2:43 pm - +265 993 98 66 79: Okay
02/12/23, 3:05 pm - +265 993 98 66 79: As for me the input power i have been putting  in doing my projects its mostly on committee development. I have manage to convince  four people for this two months. This people they have already  enrolled  into edoofa program and some they have even finished paying enrollment  fees . On the same topic am also part of the group  of students  from malawi who is helping  in giving testimony to other students  maybe who have known edoofa through the internet  and they have doubts about edoofa or some of them they just wanna understand more about edoofa . Some counselor they do forward  my number to them and i make sure to take my time to explain  and attend  every question  they have just to help the committee to grown now i have like over 20 contacts of students  from edoofa who are still in malawi even thou they didn't  enroll under me. But am still giving  my time to them so that i can adress their questions  


 The output  of this effort i have been putting  in it is that am helping  alot of students  to come and study here in india. Counselor they have alot of work to do and with my input  effort  i  can say i help them in making  points clear to students on their behalf . On my own output is that i am able to get alot of students  just because  they asked  they friends  and that friend they asked  recommended them to talk with me so that they can know about the scholarship . This is a good thing  on my side too because students are now coming to me alone without even me looking  for them 

The problem  i see is that sometimes the for the students it take alot of time for them to get there admission group  thats a draw back
04/12/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Gervais,
How are you?
04/12/23, 11:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your commitment to committee development for the Edoofa program is impressive. In just two months, you've enrolled four students and provided assistance to over 20 others in Malawi, showcasing your dedication. Your proactive approach and willingness to address student concerns have not only contributed to the growth of the committee but also earned you a trusted reputation. Despite your success, you've identified a challenge in the time it takes for students to receive their admission group. Keep up the excellent work, and may your efforts continue to positively impact students seeking educational opportunities through Edoofa.
04/12/23, 12:18 pm - +265 993 98 66 79: Thanks ma'am  i will do my best on it
04/12/23, 12:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will!
