16/09/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Noted with thanks ma'am
16/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Its just that we are experiencing bad network but on Saturday iam available
21/09/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Greetings Ms Saloni Rastogi
Im kindly asking for a session on Saturday because during the week i will be at work. 
Sorry for the inconveniences
27/09/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
27/09/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
27/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Well noted ma'am
27/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 355 1079: We may proceed with the session  but i might be responding a bit late due to pressure at work

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/09/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 355 1079: Greetings ma'am 
Yes let's start
30/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Kudzai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
07/10/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 355 1079: Morning Ms Saloni
07/10/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 355 1079: Yes ma'am
07/10/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Kudzai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 77 355 1079: Ok
07/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 77 355 1079: Yes we are on the same page ma'am
07/10/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 355 1079: Noted ma'am
07/10/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 355 1079: For now Kudzai is at school and he will be starting his exams next week
07/10/23, 8:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Kudzai takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Kudzai is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
07/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 355 1079: Its ok ma'am
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

 I should arrange for a call/video call meeting between Edoofa and these

01/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 977 5226: Ok my question is when am I supposed to do this task
01/12/23, 10:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
01/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 977 5226: Ok ma'am
01/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Kudzai, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kudzai!

04/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 977 5226: Ok thank you ma'am
04/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
04/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 977 5226: Noted ma'am
04/12/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Kudzai/Saloni/4DEC2023*
04/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
04/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
04/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 977 5226: Sounds easy.
04/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 977 5226: Ok ma'am
04/12/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
04/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 977 5226: See you

06/12/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Kudzai,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
06/12/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright!
06/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 852 6516: Yes we can begin
06/12/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why were you not present yesterday?
06/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 852 6516: I traveled to Hwange for some function
06/12/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you informed me beforehand about your absence?
06/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 852 6516: I didn't..I am sorry for not informing
06/12/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please make sure you inform me beforehand about such arrangements. I won't stop you until something requires your immediate attention but of course I would suggest an alternative where you would be able to progress without compromising on your personal task.
06/12/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, did you form the group that we discussed?
06/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 852 6516: Ok ma'am
06/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 852 6516: I wanted to work on it tomorrow
06/12/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, do add me alright!
06/12/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 852 6516: Yes I will
06/12/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
06/12/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

06/12/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
06/12/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 852 6516: I should reach out to local schools In my region and educate them about Edoofa and then explain why I joined Edoofa and share the program details..I should then provide contact details of my mentor and the principal
06/12/23, 10:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
06/12/23, 10:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.
