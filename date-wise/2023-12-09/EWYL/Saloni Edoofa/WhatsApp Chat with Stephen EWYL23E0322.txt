10/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 090 9186: The newsletter emphasized on the role of students to helping the leaders change and shape the world through young minds
10/08/23, 8:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed very true!

These were the two questions asked in the newsletter:
1. What are the benefits of taking small steps toward a goal rather than giant leaps?
2. How can consistency and persistence help one reach their full potential and achieve their goals?

May I know what are your views on it?
10/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 090 9186: Small steps , can help a student not to get too much mistakes

Consistency and persistence , can make one not lose hope and keep moving forward no matter what happens
10/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 090 9186: These ensure full productivity and unlocks the potential that is soley needed
10/08/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Absolutely, you've captured the essence of success beautifully! Remember, every great journey begins with a single step, and it's the small steps that lead to big accomplishments.
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: I have a small story in my favourites on consistency that I often share with a lot of my students. Have a look at this:
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once upon a time in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young boy named Liam. Liam had a dream that he held close to his heart: he wanted to become an accomplished artist known for his breathtaking paintings. However, he knew that this dream required dedication and hard work.

Every day after school, Liam would rush home, grab his paintbrushes, and spend hours immersed in his art. He painted the vibrant colors of the sunrise over the hills, the playful antics of the village children, and the intricate details of the flowers that adorned the village square. His passion was undeniable, but he faced challenges just like anyone else.
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: One rainy afternoon, as Liam gazed at his half-finished masterpiece, doubt crept into his mind. He wondered if his consistent efforts were truly worth it. But then, he remembered the story his grandfather had told him about a persistent river that had carved a deep canyon through solid rock over countless years. Inspired, Liam realized that just like the river, his consistent dedication would shape his future.

Through rain and shine, through doubts and moments of frustration, Liam continued to paint. He sought advice from experienced artists, learned new techniques, and refined his skills with each stroke of the brush. He painted when he felt inspired and even when he didn't, trusting that his unwavering commitment would lead him closer to his dream.
10/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Years passed, and Liam's artwork began to attract attention. People from neighboring villages came to admire his paintings, and word of his talent spread far and wide. Art critics praised his work, and his paintings started to grace the walls of galleries.

One day, a renowned art collector visited Liam's village. As he gazed upon Liam's paintings, he was captivated by the depth and emotion they conveyed. The collector recognized the rare quality of Liam's art and offered him the opportunity of a lifetime – to showcase his paintings in galleries around the world.
10/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Liam's consistent efforts had paid off. His dream, nurtured through countless hours of dedication, had blossomed into a reality more beautiful than he could have imagined. The story of the young village artist who painted his way to international acclaim became an inspiration to others, a testament to the extraordinary power of consistency.

And so, the village of rolling hills continued to thrive, and the legacy of Liam's consistency echoed through generations, reminding everyone that even the smallest of steps, taken with unwavering dedication, can lead to the grandest of achievements.
10/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 090 9186: Wow , amazing,
10/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 090 9186: Consistency really paid off for Liam
10/08/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, this is so true and I believe things automatically fall on track!
10/08/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know how is your Admission process going on?
10/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 090 9186: We are left with the $350 to complete the admission fees , ma'am once that's done then everything will be running smoothly
10/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's great Stephen, can't wait to have you here🌐
10/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 090 9186: Me too ma'am , India has always been my dream , from a young age inspired by Zeeworld movies 🤣
10/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, oh, Lord!

Are you fond of movies, that too Indian?
10/08/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 090 9186: Yes ma'am, Bollywood movies, my favorite is Bang bang if you heard of it
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Oh this is awesome, you know Hrithik Roshan?
11/08/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

14/08/23, 8:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share your understanding of the same in 150-200 words?
14/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 090 9186: Vlogging

Vlogging has become a fundamental skill that has helped people reach out their audience across the globe typically well .It requires not too much but basically ones smartphone and the the right editing skills to create the best videos.One has to have an agenda and be consistent on uploading the videos in order to keep viewers entertained or educated and as well be in a position to reach out to new viewers.As one still progress they then add more better machinery for video creation . Vlogging can make one earn , through commissions through ads or paid partnership with some companies or cooperates . Vlogging makes one bring out their dreams and passion whilst at the same time earning money . Speaking for myself, I would do vlogging since I'm also a poet hence why I created my own YouTube channel hoping very soon will have audiences for my pieces of art .

Thank you
14/08/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Stephen, you have rightly said! You can embrace vlogging as your avenue to global impact. With just a smartphone and your editing finesse, you can captivate audiences worldwide. Consistency is your ally – share your agenda and wisdom, fostering both entertainment and education. As you progress, amplify your tools. Vlogging not only fuels your dreams but fuels your pockets – ads, partnerships, commissions.

Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.
15/08/23, 5:35 am - +263 78 090 9186: Greetings and happy independence day to India Ms Saloni
17/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session⚡
17/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 090 9186: Greetings Ms Saloni
17/08/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you share it with the Admission Team?
17/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 090 9186: Yes ma'am we did
17/08/23, 9:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's great, Stephen!
17/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
17/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 090 9186: Sure ma'am
21/08/23, 8:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
Let's begin with our session⚡
21/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 090 9186: Greetings Ms Saloni how are you
21/08/23, 8:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
21/08/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 090 9186: Yes we may begin the session
21/08/23, 8:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 8:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is our weekly newsletter, hope you like it!
21/08/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 090 9186: Let me go through it ma'am
21/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 090 9186: Quite an inspirational story from one of Zimbabwes very own ,
21/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 090 9186: Brilliant minds can really change the face of the world surely
21/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: The newsletter was about two questions that were raised by the students:
1. How do seeking opportunities and building solid foundations complement each other in the context of wealth creation?
2. Could you elaborate on the specific strategies or approaches individuals can adopt to ensure ongoing learning, skill development, and adaptability in an ever-evolving economic landscape?
21/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you answer that for me?
21/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 090 9186: Sure ma'am, let me
21/08/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, and I think it is a proud moment for all of us⚡
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 090 9186: In my own words ma'am but drawing inspiration from the newsletter,

1)it helps one gain knowledge and wealth while experiencing the best they could do.It makes use of patience , budgeting saving and proper analysis to strive in business
21/08/23, 8:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is so correct!

Stephen this reflects mature understanding of the things, great work.
21/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 090 9186: Thank you ma'am I appreciate it
21/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also, what are your thoughts on the second question?
21/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 090 9186: 2) I believe in seeking opportunities and seizing them, finding loopholes in an economy and seeking solutions to cover them .As we have witnessed in many developing countries, students lack zeal of investment yet they are many things to invest and generate money from so with that sorted a bright future can be witnessed

So my strategies are: patience, problem seeking and solution finding, seek practical muscle and act upon a goal not only draft it on paper but actually do it
21/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know, many times politicians, and our leaders, their primary focus revolved around finding problems in others' strategies and ideas but they never talk about how together they can solve that issue. I feel good to hear that young students like you are thinking
21/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 090 9186: We are the future, such thinking is only here to make sure our future is not doomed Ms Saloni, I think you agree
21/08/23, 9:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Of course, I agree with you Stephen, future lies in your hands now and I think you all would agree that our future with you kids, is strong and promising.
21/08/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Stephen?
21/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 090 9186: Indeed it is Ms Saloni, as a future engineer I'm proud to have a vision that seeks to manufacture, construct and industrialize developing nations
21/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 090 9186: Honoured
21/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 090 9186: This is perfect Ms Saloni
21/08/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: I feel really proud to hear that Stephen, really makes my chest broad with pride🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
21/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 090 9186: It's going to be a wonderful journey indeed
21/08/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
21/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 090 9186: That would be great Ms Saloni
21/08/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

11/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
11/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 090 9186: Okay okay Ms Saloni

17/10/23, 12:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) *Your journey so far with the program,*

e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process.

How are you?
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263775309874 Stephen was given an amazing opportunity a few weeks ago and he was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Stephen?
20/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263775309874

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Because my targets are to be recognized in this world as a successful young lady who has just this motive to be successful and pursue my studies further and make my parents proud of me and Edoofa is the key to my success

09/11/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 6:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
25/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 090 9186: Thank u ma'am will do as that
27/11/23, 7:50 am - +263 78 090 9186: Competition has always been a major influencer in my life .At a point I thought it would benefit me to drive me to better heights buy it ended up eating me.

I later realized that my true competition is me and I set records that I my self needed to break.This helped me to become a better person and live to better my experiences .

Competition is wealthy if it's to yourself and to your personal goals.Recently I challenged myself to win in every competition I participated in and suprisely yes it did happen.I won my first debate and my second group discussion, evident that if I challenges himself to achieve certain goals you can prevail .If you challenge yourself against others you can lose because we all work at different scales and have different ambitions driven by different motives .

In the end the best competition is yourself
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Stephen!
How are you?
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your personal journey with the competition. It's inspiring to hear how you've shifted your perspective from external competition to an internal drive for self-improvement. Recognizing that the ultimate competition is with yourself is a powerful mindset that fosters growth and personal development.

Setting and surpassing your own records is a testament to the potential for continuous improvement. It's clear that your shift in focus has led to significant achievements in your debates and group discussions. Your insight about individuals working at different scales with diverse ambitions is a valuable reminder that comparing oneself to others can be counterproductive.
