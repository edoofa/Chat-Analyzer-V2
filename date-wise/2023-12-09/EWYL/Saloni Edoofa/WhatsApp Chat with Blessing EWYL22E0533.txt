How are you?
02/11/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: It has come to my attention that after a prolonged period of deliberation and numerous discussions, you have expressed your intention to resume your participation in the EWYL program. While I genuinely appreciate your decision, I must convey my sincere disappointment regarding the extended duration it took to arrive at this point.
02/11/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: During our conversations with you and the DSW team, you conveyed your inclination to discontinue your involvement in the EWYL program on multiple occasions. This prompted a series of discussions and negotiations that spanned nearly two months. While I understand that the ideas, plans, and program structure might appear overwhelming at first, your clear intent and effective communication could have significantly expedited the entire process.
02/11/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Furthermore, I must emphasize that your name is prominently associated with the Academic Board of Edoofa, and any decision to resume your participation in the EWYL program must follow a well-defined and official procedure. To that end, we kindly request that you submit a formal notification to us via email. This email should include the following information:

1. Your full name
2. The name of your university
3. The name of your EWYL group
4. The reasons that led to your decision to opt out of the program earlier
5. A comprehensive summary of the discussions that took place with both myself and the DSW team
6. The compelling reasons behind your desire to rejoin the program at this time
02/11/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: We believe that adhering to this structured process will facilitate a more efficient transition as we work towards your resumption in the EWYL program. I want to reiterate our enthusiasm for your return and the positive impact your participation can have on the program
02/11/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Send this mail to sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, deepali@edoofa.com and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com
