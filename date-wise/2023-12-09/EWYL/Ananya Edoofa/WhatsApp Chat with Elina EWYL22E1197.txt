01/11/23, 3:18 pm - +260 95 0134113: Yes
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it's about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 3:24 pm - +260 95 0134113: Private schools
01/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's an effective approach! Should I share some more channels?
01/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 95 0134113: Yes please
01/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 95 0134113: Okay
01/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 3:53 pm - +260 95 0134113: Okay
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 3:58 pm - +260 95 0134113: Okay
01/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:19 pm - +260 95 0134113: Okay
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
15/11/23, 2:42 pm - +260 95 0134113: Okay
15/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
15/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, but since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session here.

I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program. This marks an end to your training!

I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

22/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Grant Discussion: Guidelines_*

Let's revisit the time when Mr. Angad visited your country and promised you a Grant. Now that you are approaching your second semester, that time has arrived and therefore, I would like to discuss its eligibility.

I am confident you will excel in this discussion! I have scheduled our meeting for the following:

*Time: 7:00 PM*
*Date: 23/11/2023* <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 9:12 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - +91 89680 53859: Ok
23/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Elina!🌸
I hope you are doing well. Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 89680 53859: Yes
23/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, 

I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia.I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 89680 53859: Yes I recall it
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 89680 53859: Yes
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 
Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

5. I am sure you remember that a minimum of 75% attendance is required. We are currently analyzing your attendance and engagement during our sessions and the webinar. If all the requirements are seen to be fulfilled, you will be able to redeem the grant
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
23/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
23/11/23, 4:39 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
25/11/23, 8:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elina!

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023
25/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 6:05 pm - +91 89680 53859: The spirit of competition, to me, embodies the drive to constantly improve, learn, and excel. It's a force that propels me to push my limits and embrace challenges with enthusiasm. This mindset has shaped my approach to both academic and personal goals.

In a memorable academic challenge, the spirit of competition fueled my determination during a challenging project. Collaborating with classmates, we aimed not only to meet requirements but to outdo ourselves and others. This healthy competition resulted in a more innovative and comprehensive solution, showcasing the positive impact of embracing a competitive mindset.

The spirit of competition isn't just about winning; it's about continuous growth and fostering a culture of excellence.
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Elina! 🌟🏆Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've personally looked into how active you've been in the last two months, and I've found some important details to discuss. These findings are crucial because they'll determine whether you qualify for the Grant.

27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 89680 53859: Yes I'm ready
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.

27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm really happy to tell you that Nicassio from your college earned *more* credits than his grant last month. He understood that a grant has a limit, but credits don't. With the $300 plan, he's living his dreams and making his parents proud. He achieved this in just a month! Imagine the results if he continues on this trajectory.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 89680 53859: That's great
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, I want to share a fact with you that many of you are not realizing, that while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits.
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: If Nicassio can, then why can't you? Remember that you are here for making your career and helping your parents in financing your Education.

27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 89680 53859: I'd be glad to hear the plan

There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay
29/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Elina, why are you late?
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 89680 53859: I had to go and recharge my sim
29/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one hour. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
29/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 89680 53859: Yes I do understand
29/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 89680 53859: I'll be glad to hear the story
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 89680 53859: That's amazing
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 4:14 pm - +91 89680 53859: That's great and interesting
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 89680 53859: Okay I will surely do that
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :

08/12/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action *tomorrow* for December accordingly:

1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?
08/12/23, 4:36 pm - +91 89680 53859: In December, I want to invite more students to the edoofa community 

My main goal for December is to tell at least 10 people about scholarships, aiming to get enough credits to cover 75% of my university fees. This aligns with my dream of funding my education.

Looking at my performance, I think I can improve in how I reach out to people and communicate. Your help in these areas would be valuable for our success.
