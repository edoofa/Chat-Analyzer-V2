07/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kudakwashe!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 530 2324: I'm good. What 😂😂😉 ..that word it's my first time to read it

08/12/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kudakwashe!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
08/12/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 530 2324: Okay  that's fine.thank you
