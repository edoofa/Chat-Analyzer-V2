You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

27/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 447 1906: Yes I attended Ma'am.

I understood that there are two attributes of business.
The first one is marketing. Under marketing, we have advertising. There are two types of advertising which are one to many, eg on social media pages where one can make an advertisement that can be viewed by many people and also by using flyers. One advantage of one to many advertisement is that a seller can get in touch with many people at the same time. Then there is one to one advertising. In this advertisement, the seller approaches potential clients individually and advertise . One advantage of one to one advertisement is that a seller can interact with individuals thereby discovering challenges being faced or commodities or services that are in demand.

Another attribute of business is innovation.
27/09/23, 10:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Thank you so much for sharing.
27/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 447 1906: You are welcome Ma'am.

07/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

It's wednesday tomorrow, and we are back with our EWYL group session. We will be moving forward with our $300 training session, so do not miss the session!🚀

Time: 6:00 PM
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Good afternoon Ma'am.
08/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Proposed questions.

1. What makes the Edoofa program so unique from other scholarship programs?

2. What do you understand by the EWYL program?

3. Other than financing your tuition, what are other benefits of the EWYL program?

4. What is the most important feature of the program, according to your understanding and analysis?
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am, I will do so.
08/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am.
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Firstly, after finding the students I explain in detail the Edoofa program.
I use references and testimonies of students already recruited  in the program.
Then I contact an eligibility Test .
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely, I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process by asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
08/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay. I understand, I'll do my best to avoid those scenarios.
08/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Thank you Ma'am.
08/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am , I'm looking forward to them.
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Yes Ma'am.
08/11/23, 3:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023
27/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 447 1906: Saturday Activity.

Topic: The spirit of competition.


Being competitive is an important trait of being successful. It serves as a driving force behind growth,  innovation and success. Below are real world examples of the fruits of the spirit of competitiveness.

 *The competitive edge.* 
The spirit of competition instills a drive to excel, pushing organisations and individuals to improve. Apple.Inc is one such company that uses a competitive edge. The founder of Apple.Inc  was an excellent and innovative man by the name of Steve Jobs. The success of Apple.Inc lies in the competition to outshine other brands.
 *Fostering Innovation* 
With competition comes innovation. Always, companies need to stay ahead and they are willing to work an extra mile to achieve that. A good example is how Tesla invented the electric car , thereby breaking the traditional automobile landscape. His innovation also extended to renewable energy solutions and space explorations among others.
 *Economic Growth*
Generally , nations that possess the spirit of competition tend to experience growth . A good case study is is China which transformed itself from being a primarily agrarian economy to the second largest economy in the world through expanding the manufacturing sector, in technology and trade. 
 *Overcoming challenges*
Once an individual developa the spirit of competition, they also become enthusiastic in overcoming challenges. Although Michael Jordan faced many challenges, including being kicked out of his high school basketball team, he did not give up but shone to become the world's renowned basketball player with NBA.
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

I hope this message finds you well. Time for today's Wednesday lesson, it covers a topic that is fundamental to your academic and personal growth: "The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output."

05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Urgent : New schedule_*🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting tomorrow, we will only connect on Wednesdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.

📅 Wednesday, 6th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 13th December:
*Group Call*

📅 Wednesday, 19th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 29th December:
*Group Call*
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I am ready to take a step ahead by considering and respecting your time and schedule. I expect you to reciprocate the same and attend the calls. Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰
05/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am, noted.
06/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Afternoon Ma'am, how are you.
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 447 1906: I failed the riddle 😌😌
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, it's a KEYBOARD!
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Aaaah , it never crossed my mind.
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, today I want to discuss your grant with you!
06/12/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Yes Ma'am, vividly remember.
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 447 1906: I think I remember some of them.

Attaining a minimum of 75% attendance in lectures
Attaining 75% attendance in EWYL events eg webinars
06/12/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am, thank you.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Oh, I understand Ma'am.
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
06/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay, it's clear.
06/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
06/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Alright Ma'am, I will try my best.
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
06/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Yes Ma'am, I am ready.
06/12/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 447 1906: I'm more than ready Ma'am. I wish to pay as much fees as I can using credits.
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Yes Ma'am.
06/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
06/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Uuuuum, I can say first and second task, I assure you it's very  easy.
The third one, I don't know if I have pending task.
The most challenging task is the sixth one but as long as students cooperates, I believe it's a simple task.
The last one basically depend on the sixth task.
06/12/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
06/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 447 1906: Okay Ma'am, thanks.
06/12/23, 4:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our lesson with a promise to learn two amazing skills this week!
