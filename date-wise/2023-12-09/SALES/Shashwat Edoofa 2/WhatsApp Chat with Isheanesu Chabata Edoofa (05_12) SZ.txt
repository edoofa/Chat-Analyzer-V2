06/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 761706007: 👏

Your commitment to her education and broader societal impact is truly commendable, Mr. Tonderai!

Could you kindly shed more light on the profession that you pertain to, please?
06/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Good Evening
My apologies for not being online for the session.
I'm going through everything thoroughly
06/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 293 4591: Observing my daughter's abilities growing up.She is a good communicator and a critical thinker who always asks questions on historical and present societal  issues.She thrives to define present and the future,she captures things first and doesnt accepts things at face value but always weighs up options before taking a decision.Hence l believe she needs a field of problem solving in science and social fields.
06/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 293 4591: She was a good history  student and Religious and Moral studies.She then decided on registration for exams to focus on sciences only which she said she has a zeal on.Her ambition was to become an engineer but her results couldnt qualify her to obtain a local university due to Bureaucracy, competition,and lack of finance as a family because of over stretched resources.

08/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 135 9201: I have been playing the marimba on different occasions and I was a member of the Leo Club so we would go to children's homes to visit and went to  some fundraising programs workshops mainly for breast cancer awareness.
I took a gap year in 2023 to find out the program that I could be in to make a huge impact by bringing out my potential. So during that gap year I would read some books and take online courses that took a short time to complete.
Moreover go to more workshops..
I got more involved in the church in singing and organising events .
I have been advocating for the girl child in ending child marriages.
My main achievement on this one was creating a petition for Memory Machaya which later on got recognised by the UN and there are still some changes to be made so I am working on it by using my social media to research and use it as an advantage to reach out to people about this so that we can change the system together at large <This message was edited>
