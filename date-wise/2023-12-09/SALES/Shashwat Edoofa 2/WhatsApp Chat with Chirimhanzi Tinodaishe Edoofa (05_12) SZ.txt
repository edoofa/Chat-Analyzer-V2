Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Hello, my name is Tinodaishe Chirimhanzi. I'm aged 17 and im currently pursuing my education at St Faith's with the hope of finishing of my education with the help of Edoofa. During my educational journey I have passed my ordinary level examinations which gave me a chance to continue my dream. I have been exceptional in clubing activities. I am someone who loves giving back to the society which is the reason why I joined the LEO club which helps me grow mentally. I normally spend my free time reading novels about great people as I wish to write my own someday talking about my journey to success. I also play basketball and I love rugby but I haven't had the opportunity to play it yet. I have this dream of becoming a great civil engineer one day who will be recognized internationally. I also plan on later opening my own construction company and if everything goes on I will later build a children's home which I will help by sponsoring their education. I live in a family of three kids and with my parents. I am the second born child with an older sister and a younger brother. My mother is an engineer and and has recently completed Master in technology in Machine design at Harare institute of technology.
My father is a Technical sales Representative at Africa steel, he is a qualified fitter and turner.With the current situation here in Zimbabwe its getting hard for my parents to pay for the tuition of three kids so this scholarship will be a great opportunity to me and it will have really helped me and them. We live in a cottage which has 3 rooms. My parents travel to work by public transport. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tinodaishe. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. You are truly an inspiring individual with a passion for making a positive impact on society. Your involvement in the LEO club reflects your commitment to personal growth and community service, showcasing a commendable dedication to giving back. The combination of your interests, from reading novels about great people to playing basketball and aspiring to play rugby, paints a picture of a well-rounded and ambitious individual. Your dream of becoming a renowned civil engineer with international recognition and the future goal of opening a construction company and supporting a children's home through education sponsorship are not just aspirations but a testament to your vision for a brighter and more compassionate future! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 962 3537: My mother is an engineer and and has recently completed Master in technology in Machine design at Harare institute of technology.
My father is a Technical sales Representative at Africa steel, he is a qualified fitter and turner. He has also a degree in Marketing (imm South Africa)
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your parents are an incredible duo, each contributing significantly to the professional landscape. Mrs. Gerry's achievement of completing a Master's in Technology in Machine Design at Harare Institute of Technology showcases her dedication to advancing in her field of engineering. Meanwhile, Mr. Livingstone, a qualified fitter and turner with a degree in Marketing from IMM South Africa, demonstrates a versatile skill set, combining technical expertise with sales acumen!
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of your siblings?
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 962 3537: My sister is currently pursuing her degree in Electrical engineering and my brother is still in grade 3.
05/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Tinodaishe. So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Faiths High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
05/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 962 3537: For this past term and second term the fees was 400 US dollars but it has increased to 600 US dollars. Both my parents help each other to raise the money to support my education
05/12/23, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
05/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 71 962 3537: If I am able get the scholarship my parents will assist each other in supporting my education abroad.
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Livingstone and Mrs. Gerry are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and their dedication to your well-being is truly admirable!
05/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Yes they are without them I wouldn't be here
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
05/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Studying abroad would be a dream come true for me and my family. The current situation in Zimbabwe makes learning here useless if you don't have the links to those at top. Secondly studying abroad gives me exposure to different working and learning conditions even socially too, as I will be improving my socializing skills. After studying abroad I wish to come and start my business here and I would have made the connections with those abroad who will help me grow internationally.
05/12/23, 9:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Tinodaishe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 962 3537: That's right
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Thank you

05/12/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Tinodaishe. I must say that you have obtained impeccable grades!
05/12/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
05/12/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Thank you but I'm aiming for 15 points
05/12/23, 10:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
05/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 962 3537: With the correct work input it's achievable
05/12/23, 10:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Tinodaishe!
05/12/23, 10:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
05/12/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 962 3537: As I mentioned before I want to do Civil engineers. What has really drove me to this occupation is the subjects I do. I have evaluated my options and figured it was the best choice.
05/12/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 962 3537: It's a really cool program and what really fascinates me about is that you spend most of the time out in the field rather than sitting in offices and I am a person who love nature. I want to be known for designing something great on earth

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 962 3537: Good morning
06/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 962 3537: Yes I am
06/12/23, 9:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tinodaishe!
06/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Tinodaishe, could you please share why you didn't pursue Chemistry in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
06/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 962 3537: It is an important subject but with the path I want to take it's not as important because what's really necessary if you are to do engineering is Maths and Physics.
06/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 962 3537: Unfortunately I didn't do enough research. So with my combination there's no chance of me getting the scholarship?
06/12/23, 9:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews! Could you kindly delve into your career aspirations, please?
06/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 962 3537: During my career I wish to aquire some skills and to meet my aspirations 

1. **Project Management**:As a civil engineers I aspire to become a projects manager, lead teams and oversee the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure projects.

2. **Design Engineering**: I am also passionate about the design aspect of my  work and aspire to specialize in areas such as structural design, transportation engineering, or water resources engineering.

3. **Construction Management**: I also plan on moving  into construction management, overseeing the actual building and implementation of infrastructure projects.

4. **Entrepreneurship**: I also have the ambition of starting my own engineering firms, offering specialized services or innovative solutions to infrastructure challenges.

Lastly I also wish to start my own construction company.
