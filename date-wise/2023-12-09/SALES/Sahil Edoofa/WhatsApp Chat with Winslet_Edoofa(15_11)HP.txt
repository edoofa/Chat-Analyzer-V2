How are you doing today?

24/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 271 7108: If you have any questions I have some time to spare, you may ask me
24/11/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please

Have you been able to follow the discussion so far?
24/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 271 7108: Ye I have
24/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 271 7108: Very progressive
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
24/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 271 7108: In the event that she gets selected, hopefully, in terms of accommodation where exactly would she staying for the duration of the semester or learning period
24/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 271 7108: Will she be able to get the specific programs she wishes to study and what are the academic requirements in terms of for example the points at A level
24/11/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Sure, let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
24/11/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 271 7108: Thank you so much that was very clear
24/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 271 7108: I understand that’s very clear as well
24/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 271 7108: This was very helpful thank you
24/11/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
24/11/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Mr McRomeo, do you understand the following too please?
24/11/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 271 7108: Yes I understand
24/11/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: So as parents are you willing to support Winslet 's higher education in India mentally and financially please?
24/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 271 7108: Yes we are willing, we think that it’s a very big opportunity for her and we will support her both mentally and financially
24/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Its great to see that you are supportive, Mr McRomeo.
24/11/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: She managed to share her interests in pursuing Actuarial sciences,

Are you aware of the same?
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 271 7108: Yes I am aware
24/11/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done

27/11/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Winslet 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Mr McRomeo Maritinu is familiar with the costs thus the effort of trying to attain a scholarship to help fund the course of academic learning
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, as discussed earlier, I would highly appreciate your active participation so that we conclude our discussion.
27/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Noted
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall when we discussed the same earlier?
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Of course
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: That's great
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 303 4007: I agree
27/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
27/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
27/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Depend on the financial payment strategies
27/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
27/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 303 4007: I follow
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
27/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, kindly be informed that you active participation is very important as you already must be aware that we are in discussion since 15th November.
28/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same Winslet?
28/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 303 4007: I did
28/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Go ahead?
28/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 303 4007: If a student manages to get a 100% scholarship will they still pay the $2000  to $3000 fee a Year
28/11/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 303 4007: I mean financially will there be cases were one gets a  scholarship and all expenses per year are paid for
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Full scholarship I mean
28/11/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, I believe you thoroughly read the document I shared.

Do you recall the learnings regarding financial aspect?
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes I recall
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Winslet, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the pictures and video, Winslet?
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, yet again you are not properly participating.

Do you wish to complete your application process?
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Winslet, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 303 4007: $1500 - $2250
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Where will I be getting the recommendation letter
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: From your school itself, however the admissions team would assist you with that later.
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Noted
28/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: You see, Winslet, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed, Winslet?
28/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 303 4007: I do
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 303 4007: Yes
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
28/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

29/11/23, 7:48 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

29/11/23, 8:12 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
