You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

05/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 547 0878: Education abroad is a life channging decision.It  is noted that if you study abroad job opportunities are not scarce as most Scholarships has you sorted till you find a job and also if you studied abroad you will have more knowledge and experience.Also while studying abroad you can start or invest on other businesses as means to better your future. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing, Nomakhosi.

Meanwhile, may I know what is your understanding of a scholarship, as to what all expenses are catered for?
05/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 547 0878: There are Fully funded scholarships and half funded scholarships.Fully funded scholarships are those where by you are given an opportunity to study with all your needs catered for for example fees,apartment,travelling neccessities and also allowance for things like food.
A half funded scholarship are those where they only cater for half of your things and then you take care of the rest.
05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 547 0878: Oky I now understand
05/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read it please?
05/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 547 0878: Yes I did it just that I am a fast reader
05/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

So far do you have any queries?
05/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 547 0878: No queries at all
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
05/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 547 0878: They are aware of my plans and they are willing to support me mentally but financially it may be a bit of a struggle
05/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Nomakhosi.

However would you agree with me that studying abroad would require financial support?
05/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 547 0878: Yess I agree
05/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so how are you planning for the same?
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 547 0878: I'm striving for excellence on my school work so I can get a sponsorship
05/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however Edoofa only offers Scholarship please.
