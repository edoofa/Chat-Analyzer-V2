07/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Well received, Anotidaishe, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

07/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

07/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 365 0358: Thank you for the information, I now explicitly understand what EDOOFA is about.
07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: It's great to know that you found the information helpful, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Anotidaishe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD SCHOOL charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 365 0358: As you know, my name is Anotidaishe. I’m an 18 year old boy who did his primary education at Highlands primary school, where I played hockey in the first team since grade 3. I played hockey for 7 years then stopped because ofthe pandemic, I look forward to resume playing hockey in January 2024. I was enrolled at Goromonzi high school in Mashonaland East where I played tennis as a second sport. I became interested in Architecture and started doing Building, technology and design as one of my major subjects and I was one of the top students. I passed 10 Ordinary level subjects and later decided to do arts subjects because had developed more interest in them as time unfolded. Upon deciding to do arts subjects I changed my career path and decided that I want to do social work or anything related to humanitarian aid. I did my Advanced level education at Westminster International School where I studied History, Sociology and Literature in English . I was also the top student in my literature class. I also have good records with all three schools’ teaching staff and extracurricular departments.

The school fees at Westminster International was  $1200 USD 

As for my family, my mother recently left her job as a nurse to work full time in business marketing, which she had started as a side project in 2004. She has an undergraduate marketing degree, and is about to write her final exam for her digital marketing degree. My father is a Car Salesman and also serves as the driver of the car courier as a hobbie, he studied sciences up to A level and decided to follow his father’s footsteps who had interest in cars. I have two younger brothers, one aged 14 and the other aged 10

07/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Anotidaishe, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your interests in both sports and academics, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 365 0358: Are there any specific requirements or qualifications need to get a scholarship?
07/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in detail as we proceed ahead with the discussion.
07/12/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Well Anotidaishe now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 365 0358: I believe tertiary education fosters growth and studying abroad would be a change for development of exposure in an individual and is a doorway for cultural diversity and cohesion.

And I do believe that it’s a life changing decision.
07/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Anotidaishe.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 365 0358: Yes, I’m prepared for life abroad.
07/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 365 0358: My family is fully aware of this decision and they are willing to support me both mentally and financially.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

08/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I understand please!
08/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: So Anotidaishe, what motivates you to study social work/humanitarian aid?
08/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 365 0358: Firstly I’ve always wanted to work for the United Nations ever since I learnt about Bismark when I was doing my O level. I developed interest in changing the world and people’s lives and doing social work is a stepping stone. I plan doing bigger probably peace keeping or security for the United Nations.
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Well that's surely well thought off,

Let me share more details about your desired field
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
08/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 365 0358: I have read it and have understood more about social work and sociology, thank you for the information.
08/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's good,

So now shall I brief you Bachelors in Sociology, Anotidaishe?
08/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 365 0358: No thanks you, im fully aware about how studies in sociology are as I was informed by my sociology teachers
08/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Thats great, however I am referring to the Degree that you would be studying!
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 365 0358: You may brief me then
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

08/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Kindly inform me once you have read it
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I have read it.
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright Anotidaishe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 365 0358: If I do sociology I think the career opportunities are wider in the field of social work and humanitarian aid as it appears to be social work at a larger scale. It can enable me to achieve my dreams as the career paths are similar. In 5 years I will be starting my career in social work preparing to get my masters degree.
08/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Anotidaishe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation as well.
08/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I want to study abroad to gain exposure, learn what’s happening outside of Zimbabwe and get to know the world better.
08/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: It's wonderful that you are looking at maximum exposure, Anotidaishe!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I’ve been learning about India for years now. I’ve understood that India is a very cultured and religious place. Cricket is also the most popular sport in India, which is the same as Zimbabwe and has over 20 languages 

It is also the second most populous country which would be an advantage in gaining exposure as it has social diversity, this also makes studying sociology in India more relevant than most countries. The cost of living in India is also low which makes life easier for students. Due to the existence of strong culture and religion there is high mortality and this creates a friendly and safe environment for foreign students
08/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see your knowledge and awareness, Anotidaishe!
08/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

08/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 365 0358: This is very interesting and is assuring a successful career path
08/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Anotidaishe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 365 0358: We had not looked at the costs yet
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

08/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 365 0358: Noted
08/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I think it’s very helpful and I don’t mind working as I study
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I agree
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Anotidaishe?
08/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
