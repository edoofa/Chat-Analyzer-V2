29/11/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Thank you for the advise
29/11/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 7:19 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:0 pm CAT on Thursday(30/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
29/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 538 1851: No l  only applied to this scholarship
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 538 1851: No l don't know can you brief me
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
30/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Yes l will benefit sice l be able to get more skills in different aspects , also l will be able to support myself with other expenses needed  in school
30/11/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
30/11/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Yeah thank you
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,

01/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Great indeed
01/12/23, 12:44 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 538 1851: My parents
01/12/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 538 1851: They are very excited for me to get the opportunity to study abroad .
01/12/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
01/12/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
01/12/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
01/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Sure! When applying to a university abroad, there are a few key things that most universities will require. First, students will need to submit high school results like O level and A level results. Second, most universities will require a personal statement or essay, which allows the student to share their story and explain why they want to attend that particular school. Finally, most universities will require letters of recommendation, which can come from teachers, counselors, or other adults who know the student well. These requirements can vary from university to university, so it's important to check with the specific schools you're interested in.
01/12/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
01/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
01/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
01/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Yeah
01/12/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
01/12/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Okay
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Okay so you are saying  you can pay the enrollment fee before the A level results are out , what if the student want to enroll when his or her A level results out is it possible
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: Rufaro, we have limited number of seats and a lot of applications in the waiting list. 

This it is always beneficial to enroll and reserve your seat at the earliest
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Okay l understand
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Stage 1 ,2 ,3 and 4
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct! 

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Okay
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Yeah
01/12/23, 7:37 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 7:41 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

06/12/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?

06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 538 1851: They just want to be sure that if  a student fails to get the scholarship admission fee of that year  for example 2025 will  he or she would be able to apply for another intake ?
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Like 2026
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: That completely depends on the availability of the scholarship seats. As of now, we have 750+ Edoofians who have qualified for the upcoming intakes and it would be challenging. This is the reason, we have a detailed session regarding all the aspects of the program and proceeds with full confidence of the family
06/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Okay thanks
06/12/23, 3:13 pm - Arshita: May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 538 1851: They said with  conditions that we  actually facing here in Africa they will manage to apply in 2025
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Arshita: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
06/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Not really l will compare but the difference is not that huge that's why l want to study abroad
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
06/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 538 1851: Of course l'm looking forward  to have that opportunity
06/12/23, 5:06 pm - Arshita: Good to know that!
06/12/23, 5:06 pm - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 538 1851: 1..The program l want to do is business administration
 2..The country that l will be studying through Edoofa is India
3..The average cost of studying  in India without scholarship is approximately $6000-$8000.
4...The annual fee l will pay if l have been found to  eligible for the program $2000-$3000.

5..The enrollment fee of the program is $350   and it so paid  within thirty days, the first $200is paid within seven days and the remaining will be paid within the next thirty days.

6..Earn while you program it is the program that student can use to raise their tution fee through Edoofa . It helps students to afford learning in International Universities where there is higher education as compared to the local university. Students will be given scholaship credits  which can be used to pay up their fees.The Earn While You learn program help students to get communication skills , working skills  creative skills also analytical skills .The projects that they will be working on are research based,content writing and social media research. Students might be assigned online  were their performance skills will be measured and rated.

7.Im not aware can  you tell me clearly .
07/12/23, 8:42 pm - Austin: Good Work, Rufaro!
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor At Edoofa*
07/12/23, 8:43 pm - Austin: 7) The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

As discussed earlier the cost of education ranges between $2000-$3000 which includes the registration fee too.
