20/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes  we can
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ruramai,
I hope that you are doing well today.
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ruramai, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Persistance ?*
20/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 086 8163: 1. My first motivation to apply for the Edoofa Schorlaship program is to esteem my life through international recognized degrees ,doing international law in India more to that India is an economically stable country with better living conditions
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 086 8163: 2 my understanding of the program *Edoofa Program Benefits* 


 *Edoofa: Education for All.* 
The Edoofa program is the result of years of dedication of our founders *[Mr.Angad & Mr.Avreen Singh]* 
towards solving two of the most important problems in the current education system- lack of 
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success anymore.

• The industry 
moves at a very fast pace in this digital era and students need to prepare not only for the jobs of 
today but also of the future. 
That can happen only through *real experience and exposure.* 

• What Edoofa has managed to accomplish is *unique and transformative* - providing a higher 
education that is of a *global standard* , the *most affordable* and is *highly employment oriented* .
No student or parent should be crushed by debt for wanting a better future ahead.

• Edoofa was 
built to provide a forward-thinking, world-class education that prepares students for the jobs of 
today and tomorrow.

• There are quite some few reasons for Edoofa program being the best scholarship program for 
International students:

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a 
decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed the lives of 
thousands of students. 
This unique benefit comes to all our students where they get to 
learn and make great career decisions because of the help and mentorship that our 
expert counsellors give.

● *Higher Education Concierge* (care-taker); this is also one of the unique benefits and 
valuable services that our students enjoy. No other college or program offers this level 
of mentorship which starts before the admission and stays with the students 
throughout their college journey.

All our University campuses have Edoofa offices and Edoofa campus managers are 
there with the International students to help them with all the aspects of education —
from Academic to SEELS, from hostel to food, from teaching staff to other extra 
activities, from making friends and joining communities to having access to events and 
other extra -curricular activities — *Our students rely on the full-fledged support*
*provided by our campus managers.*

 No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to 
them during their course of Education!
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 086 8163: In short the Edoofa program Schorlaship is trying to uplift the Academic life of International students

20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries.

20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 



The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

07/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Thank you for  sharing  this information ,and I'm really wanting to study in India

07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ruramai, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 086 8163: No I'm not aware , you can help me mem
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
07/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes you can help me sir to be part of the Eddoofer
07/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes you can help me to get a scholarship
07/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Ruramai, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
07/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 086 8163: No can you help me , but i really appreciate this idea of working whilst learning inorder to reduce costs
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes , I believe they will be able to meet the demands
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ruramai
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 086 8163: While amazing
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes ,I do believe that it is going to benefit me greatly
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Thank you with this amazing information , I really understand
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
07/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes well noted mem   ,  I promise you to work hard to sponsor my higher education because of my background
07/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

07/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 086 8163: I will talk with my brother
07/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 086 8163: I believe my brother will be helping me
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes I already talked with him ,and he said to me I really promise to help you ,if you go
07/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 086 8163: It will be a prestige to my family as they know that , I will also help them in the near future
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ruramai, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 086 8163: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 amazing facts
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Absolutely this is the real process
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes you can further explain
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 086 8163: This one it's too much
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly!
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: .However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Ok well noted mem
07/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes thank you well noted
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Ruramai
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 086 8163: I think it's level 1
07/12/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
07/12/23, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
07/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes you can proceed
07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
