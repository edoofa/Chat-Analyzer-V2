It costs US$100 per term.
I would like to take medicine. It has always been my passion to study medicine. In actual fact, I got the motivation to be a doctor and save lives from my society. People are dying of some diseases and ailments that could or can be treated. It therefore, came as an inspiration for me to do better and save lives!!
I love interacting with others . It is one of my strengths,that is, talking and socialising with others. 
I am very good at absorbing pressure very well and handling a lot of tasks very well therefore, multitasking is my strength as well.
I am also very fond of reading , through reading I ge to understand and know better hance reading is my strength as well.
Nonetheless, sometimes I can be very shy to start a conversation with other people, strangers to be specific. I get cold feet when it comes to being open with other and that serves to be a weakness.

During my spare time, I love reading. It helps me to have a better view about something.
I also love playing board games like chess. 

I come from a family of 2 children and a single parent.My mother is a domestic worker. She has always been our financial support system. Her highest level of education was upper 6.
I have an older brother who's 19years old currently studying architecture part time.
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Arshita: Good to see that you are from Mashonaland , it is near to Harare
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Arshita: Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year.

27/11/23, 6:28 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
27/11/23, 6:28 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes I am confident of achieving it.
27/11/23, 6:30 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
27/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I haven't started with the research, I was thinking of doing that this upcoming december holiday
27/11/23, 6:32 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
05/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 430 3418: No i am no
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
05/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes..
05/12/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 430 3418: N
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 430 3418: No
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes I think I'll benefit from the EWYL program
05/12/23, 3:00 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
05/12/23, 3:00 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Noted
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes I have noted
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
05/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I have liked point number 4 mainly
05/12/23, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

05/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I have seen them and I am more  interested in the EWYL program
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 430 3418: My mother
05/12/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Thy are okay with it although they sometimes feel.like I'll be lonely and all that without any family member to look after me
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes, it is
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes you can
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Okay
05/12/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

05/12/23, 3:23 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I think we are past stage 4
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct! 

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Okay
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
05/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

06/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Well i got to inform them of how the program operates. I gave them the documents of the Edoofa and they read and understood. We had to talk about the funds mostly. However, they said they might not be able to find for the reduced 2000 - 3000 per annum. I then told them about the Earn while you learn program which will help in funding for my basic necessities and they were a bit relieved
06/12/23, 8:30 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
06/12/23, 8:30 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?

07/12/23, 9:37 am - Austin: Good to hear from you, Myckeilah!
I hope you are doing well
07/12/23, 9:38 am - Austin: Please address the same
07/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 430 3418: Ahh no I don't think they have questions,
07/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 430 3418: Am good how are you
07/12/23, 9:44 am - Austin: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
07/12/23, 9:44 am - Austin: Good to know, I am very well!
07/12/23, 9:45 pm - Austin: Myckeilah, I see you haven't responded despite seeing the messages
07/12/23, 9:46 pm - Austin: If you are not serious about this opportunity, we will have to revoke your application to offer the chance to the next applicant
08/12/23, 7:33 am - +263 78 430 3418: Well, we didn't talk much about enrollment fees and I'd like an elaboration on that, and as for the cost of education, we had a talk about it and like I once said I quite highlighted them on the benefits of the Edoofs program and how it reduced the costs therefore, they are okay with it. Nonetheless, they raised a question yesterday, asking about an example of a case whereby my parent could have lost a job unannounced and since she's the one who will be responsible for my financial stability there, what can be done to assist such a case besides the EWYL program?
08/12/23, 7:34 am - +263 78 430 3418: My apologies for such, of which it was quite not under my control, soon after viewing the messages, the Wi-fi I was using had connection problems .
08/12/23, 7:35 am - +263 78 430 3418: God morning
08/12/23, 7:35 am - +263 78 430 3418: Good morning
08/12/23, 9:50 am - Austin: Good Morning Myckeilah!
How are you today?
08/12/23, 9:52 am - Austin: This is well noted, in that case, you can request for a grace period which would be an extended period of time to pay your cost of education and if things are challenging, you can request for a term off which would give enough time to your family for preparations
08/12/23, 9:52 am - Austin: I understand and are you available today?
08/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I am okay how are you
08/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Okay thank you, I understand
