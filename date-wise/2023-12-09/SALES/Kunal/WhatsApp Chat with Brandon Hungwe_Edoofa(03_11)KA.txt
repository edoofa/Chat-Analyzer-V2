I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
18/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kunal: Greetings everyone
I hope you all are doing fine.

Since we are experiencing a rush of applicants, we wish that no deserving candidate misses the opportunity
So, if you are not willing to continue, we will be revoking your application by tomorrow (19/11/2023) and will be allotting your slot to the next applicant.

Stay blessed!
