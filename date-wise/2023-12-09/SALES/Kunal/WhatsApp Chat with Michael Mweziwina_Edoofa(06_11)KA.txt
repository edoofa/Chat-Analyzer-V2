07/11/23, 7:05 am - +265 886 05 23 13: Hello apologies for my absence I was caught up with a few things these past days so apparently I will be free today at 2pm hope that's fine with you
07/11/23, 5:02 pm - +265 883 55 66 80 was added
07/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
07/11/23, 2:36 pm - +265 886 05 23 13: Alright
07/11/23, 2:38 pm - +265 886 05 23 13: First I stay with my mother but she's mostly available in the evenings so I don't know if it's possible to continue without her for now and add her in the evening??
07/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
07/11/23, 2:50 pm - +265 886 05 23 13: Aunt carol.vcf (file attached)
07/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kunal: Shall we also add your parents?

My motivation to support Michael further his education is to make sure that he's able to support himself in future. Education is key to a successful life and knowledge is power.
