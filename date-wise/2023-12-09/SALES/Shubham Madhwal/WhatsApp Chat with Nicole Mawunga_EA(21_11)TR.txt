Here's my answer for your question 
Being provided with a career option mostly law abroad, I see myself as  successful and highly skilled attorney in five years. I would have established myself as a respected professional within the legal community, and would be providing clients with top-notch legal services. I would have a strong network of professional contacts, and would be well-versed in international law. I would be working to promote and defend the rights of my clients, and would be a champion for justice and equality. I would also be learning new languages, and would be travelling to different countries to gain exposure and experience. Overall, I would be living my dream and making it ,
And with the help of Edoofa 
I can achieve my  dreams by providing financial support for education and training. By receiving a scholarship, l can focus on my  studies without worrying about the financial burden of tuition and other expenses. This can allow me to pursue my  desired career and achieve my  goals.
