08/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?

08/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
08/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I am aware that Edoofa can assist in covering between 50% to 80% of the costs which then leads to the costs being cut down to somewhere between $2000 - $3000 which will also be be partly tackled by the earn while you learn program hence it is very cost friendly
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
