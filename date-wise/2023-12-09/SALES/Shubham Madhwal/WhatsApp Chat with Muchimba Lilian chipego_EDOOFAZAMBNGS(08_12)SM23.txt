Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

My mother passed when I was in my fourth grade and my father is a police officer in Mongu in the western part of Zambia.   My father's highest level of education was grade twelve after that he went for training to be a police officer  . In my secondary school journey my aunty and my uncle have been of been sponsoring my education needs not until I completed my grade twelve in the year twenty- twenty  three which is rather this year.on the part for who is supporting me with my financial needs abroad I am not very sure if my aunty and my uncle will be able to continue giving me support until that that far or maybe another relative of mine will offer me support when I am there.I have one sibling who is my young brother and he will be going in his Ninth grade next year . I was learning at Njase girls secondary school from the year twenty-twenty nineteen to the year twenty-twenty  three  and it is located in choma which is in the southern part of Zambia.The school fees was two thousand two hundred and fifty five for the first two years I was there and it was later reduced to one thousand  five  hundred and fifty five  in the last three years I was there this was because a free education policy was introduced in when the government was changed  . In the year twenty -twenty one  I was given a sponsorship for school fees only as it became a bit difficult for my aunty and my uncle to support me with both my school fees and my trunk food at the same time as they had children and other dependents too.My sponsor was a former Njase girl too.I just hope I qualify to be at your school with my results .
