05/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 895 0480: I am fine as well
05/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Prominent, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, is that correct?
05/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
05/12/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kudakwashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 895 0480: I learnt that the program is more beneficial to a greater extent and to my understanding the journey is competitive since the program is whispered
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 895 0480: I got the sense
05/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 895 0480: Thus correct
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Prominent, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
06/12/23, 7:18 am - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
06/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I want to help the sick in the country and world at large. Having a better understanding of chemistry at school, love to serve life
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble cause.
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
06/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 895 0480: No
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 895 0480: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Please send form 5 results too.
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Okay

06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: If you remember the results you can send through text too.
06/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Pure mathematics: C
Physics: B
Chemistry: B 
The picture will follow
06/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Thus correct
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: So, therefore, I cannot offer you a subject in medicine but I can in engineering.
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 895 0480: What about civil engineering
06/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is possible.
06/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go in that direction?
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Civil engineering is right too
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech Civil Engineering*
06/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 895 0480: That one is right sir
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir I am confident
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I got it
06/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
06/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
07/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
07/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Hello sir sorry for being late
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let us continue the session now.
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field.
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
07/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I had understood detail about the the course
07/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 895 0480: It takes how many years to complete the course
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: It is a 4 year course.
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes l understand it
07/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 895 0480: After completion of the course l would like to help develop the country and the world at large. This can help me to earn a better living provided the Edoofa Program has raised me. Also I would like to help my family, my siblings inclusive in persueing their better education. For the benefit of the country, l would like to develop the country by building roads and bridges which provide a better infrastructure to the country. Additionally I will also work in different industries like oil industry exploring materials which provide benefits to the country and world at large. Lastly I would help other students to persue their better education and l would like to encourage other students to join the  Edoofa Program.
07/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Prominent, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir l am willing
07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Better education facilities and high employment opportunities after the course
07/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
07/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Right sir I would like to develop the country by constructing good roads there by providing a good infrastructure to the country
07/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Prominent, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
07/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I agree
07/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
07/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 895 0480: It's correct
07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

07/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I see sir
07/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now Prominent, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
07/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I have understood everything sir
07/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
07/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir
07/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 895 0480: But to a little bit
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 895 0480: It is cheap in lndia as l have observed
07/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 895 0480: What will be the tuition fees for a single semester
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: The exact fees will be known to you by the university itself, but in simple words Prominent what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Okay sir now I got the sense
07/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
07/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir
07/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Okay sir we can proceed
07/12/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

07/12/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/12/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

07/12/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
07/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
07/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir l will benefit
07/12/23, 8:01 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/12/23, 7:47 am - +263 77 895 0480: Morning sir
08/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 895 0480: Good morning everyone
08/12/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Prominent, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 895 0480: Okay sir
08/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 895 0480: It is clear
08/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
08/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 895 0480: That it what l am looking for
08/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
08/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes I have understood
08/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Prominent, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
08/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
08/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes you can ask here
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
08/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 895 0480: $1500 -$2250
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Prominent, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I got you
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I think so
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
08/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Clear sir
08/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
08/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 895 0480: As for now l am not familiar sir
08/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Prominent, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
08/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes now l have understood
08/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
08/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
08/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I have understood sir
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
08/12/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 895 0480: All right sir
