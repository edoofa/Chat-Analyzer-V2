Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 97 8447239: Good morning sir
First and foremost I want to thank you for this opportunity and hoping for more interactions like this soon.
My prior understanding  of what I think about this program is that it is a program that was established to give African girls standard education in India so as help them gain more knowledge and help the community at large.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Dear, it is not just for girls but for anyone who is eligible.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:10 am - +260 97 8447239: Yes, very true
05/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 97 8447239: Wow I'm impressed
05/12/23, 9:12 am - +260 97 8447239: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 97 8447239: Thank you for the information
05/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 97 8447239: Is it that before the edoofians go to India you will  visit them in their countries first?
05/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 97 7883184: Very motivating
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Unfortunately before coming to India, they talk to us through online Video calls only, but we make sure to be waiting for them with full excitement at the airport.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Nchimunya, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir I strongly believe I can
05/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 8447239: What are qualities do u look for to choose an edoofian?
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Well Nchimunya, you can surely impress me by being active as most students lose the chance of getting a higher quantam of scholarship due to prolonged counselling sessions where they were not active.
05/12/23, 9:48 am - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
05/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 8447239: Do you also wait for the results to be out?
05/12/23, 9:53 am - +260 97 8447239: Earlier you mentioned something about projects, what projects do you give?
05/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Nchimunya, let us be patient and continue with the counselling session.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Your every concern will be addressed ahead.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 8447239: I'm willing to give  in my all sir even more than 200%
06/12/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 8447239: I have no problem with studying in my country but the reason why I want to study abroad is that as countries we differ in the quality of education. It would give me a chance to learn new skills and ideas and new ways of life that I will use to develop my country. I would also teach other countries my  country's culture and ideas because I believe in the concept "Ubuntu:" which means we are all one.
06/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 97 8447239: I noticed that people in my country don't go to Universities because of lack of funds but with the help of technology I would conduct online tuitions and study sessions and I would create social groups for more interactions and exchange of knowledge.
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 9:56 am - +260 97 8447239: I noticed that people in my country don't go to Universities because of lack of funds but with the help of technology I would conduct online tuitions and study sessions and I would create social groups for more interactions and exchange of knowledge.
06/12/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 8447239: And that is how I would help my country's education system
06/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Nchimunya, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 8447239: I agree sir
06/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 10:16 am - +260 97 8447239: Yes
06/12/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?

06/12/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: No, that is not the case.
06/12/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: The University that offers you the scholarship seat is where you go.
06/12/23, 10:44 am - +260 97 8447239: Ok but do they offer same opportunities?
06/12/23, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
06/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 10:50 am - +260 97 8447239: We are not certain of the cost but all we know is that it is quite expensive
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 10:55 am - +260 97 8447239: Wow that is very good
06/12/23, 10:55 am - +260 97 8447239: Does this program offer 100% scholarship?
06/12/23, 10:56 am - +260 97 8447239: Do you also pay for the plane ticket?
06/12/23, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: Yes, but the quantam of scholarship depends on your counselling session, your eligibility tests, and your interviews.
06/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
06/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 8447239: Do you also pay for the plane ticket?
06/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: The cost of travelling to India is a one time cost that you have to bear, but our experts will be there to guide you through VISA applications.
06/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Nchimunya what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 12:30 pm - +260 97 8447239: Hmmm very interesting is there more to it?
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes please
06/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Nchimunya, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 8447239: This sounds amazing....you mentioned something about SEO what is it exactly ?
06/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: SEO skills are important because it increases a company's online ranking. These skills help an SEO professional increase traffic to a website by developing content with the right phrases and keywords. Typically, a company might use SEO knowledge to evaluate and analyze websites that require improvement and optimization.
06/12/23, 12:49 pm - +260 97 8447239: Very interesting
06/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

06/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

06/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes I really think this will help seeing all the opportunities and support that Edoofa is offering
06/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Nchimunya, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 8447239: Given a chance to be in this program I would work hard and give it my all
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir
06/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 8447239: I would love to be amongst the best performing students in Edoofa
06/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Nchimunya, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir I have  clearly understood this program
06/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nchimunya, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/12/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir provided with a scholarship that is
06/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir I have
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 8447239: I'm always ready for opportunities like this sir
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Nchimunya as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 8447239: About $1500-$2250
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Nchimunya, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 8447239: Go on sir
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 8447239: That's delightful
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 8447239: I agree
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 8447239: This message was deleted
06/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: However Nchimunya, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 8447239: Is that all the payment needed?
06/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, for the enrollment this is all needed.
06/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 8447239: Not really
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nchimunya, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
06/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 3:19 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes I have
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 8447239: After paying for the Edoofa program, are the fees for all the Universities the same?
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of education of a student from almost ranges $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 8447239: Okay well understood
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
06/12/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 8447239: Is there a need to submit anything before we meet tomorrow?

07/12/23, 10:17 am - +260 97 7883184: Noted with thanks
07/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Hello @260978447239 @260977883184 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
07/12/23, 12:08 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Are your parents active?
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 7883184: Yes
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 97 7883184: Yes. Following
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - +260 97 7883184: The way I perceived it is that there is a fee for the application form, transport and accommodation. Kindly split the amount according to percentages. That is, 100, 75 and 50.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - +260 97 7883184: What about tuition fees?
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: The split for the total fees depends on different universities but in simple words Mrs Juliet what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: And the enrollment fee offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
07/12/23, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7883184: In short, the enrollment fee, accommodation , food and the cost of education for a yr is $3000 . Transport cost not inclusive.

07/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 8447239: Yes we are
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: So @260977883184 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @260978447239 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7883184: Kindly elaborate more on the 7 day enrollment fee payment deadline.
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 7883184: Nchimunya Sautu's grade 12 results are not yet out.
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Please let me know if there is any more doubt about the enrollment fee.
07/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 97 8447239: It is well sir
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7883184: For now, we are financially handicapped at the  because we have 4 students that we sponsor at college level.
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Yes I understand your situation, but is not the education of your own child is equally important, that too when she is getting a chance to get education far superior than you own country?
07/12/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 8447239: It is sir
