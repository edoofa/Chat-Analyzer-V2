06/12/23, 9:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
06/12/23, 9:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Rufaro, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.

06/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 598 8213: Just an estimate of money used per month for the above cost
06/12/23, 9:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Rufaro, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
06/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 598 8213: Ok I get you according to what you say I think  they will be able to support me while I'm there
06/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 598 8213: I would like to explore the opportunity it sounds to be great
06/12/23, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: yes Rufaro
06/12/23, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know that Have you discussed this with your parents as they have to manage your other siblings expenses too. <This message was edited>
