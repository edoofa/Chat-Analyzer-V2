*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* 



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
27/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Yes
27/10/23, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

30/10/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Sorry sir but you asked me the very same question After sending the pictures
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Studying in India will help me have the best and valued degree in mechanical engineering and l believe that l can apply for any mechanical engineering job and have it as long as l have the knowledge and experience from India
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Christian. I posed the same question to you after providing information about India, so with the knowledge you now have about India, you should be able to respond.
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?

31/10/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
31/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Yes sir
31/10/23, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing, Christian?
31/10/23, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Please acknowledge this.
31/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Yes sir we are now aware
31/10/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please share your understanding!
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Yes it is and also results for A level are required
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
31/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Yes please do explain
31/10/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Christian, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course* <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
31/10/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
31/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Ok l understand
31/10/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Christian.
31/10/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 312 4048: Stage 1
31/10/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
31/10/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
31/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 312 4048: can we please continue tomorrow the lunch time is over am now heading for lessons

Let's have a discussion tomorrow night, if unavailable tomorrow. Your success is our top priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. *Usually, my working hours are over by now, but I'm extending them to accommodate your needs.*

03/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'm now ready if you're free we can start.
03/11/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
03/11/23, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you are having a great day, Mr. Maxwell
03/11/23, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I hope that you have gone through the previously shared information, Let me explain other steps to you.
03/11/23, 3:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*


This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 3:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
03/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 338 2606: It's clear
03/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Mr. Maxwell.
03/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Maxwell, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family - <This message was edited>

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

I hope you are doing well
06/11/23, 7:41 pm - Austin: I am having a good time, thanks for asking
06/11/23, 7:41 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'd been following and l discovered that Edoofa is helpful and is the cheapest considering other countries. I wish if you can consider Christian on the scholarship Program.
06/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 338 2606: My question goes like this, do you allow students to work during school breaks to boost their finances for both fees and personal use.
Another question, if parents faces financial challenges do you allow the students to continue with their studies while parents will be running about looking for fees.
I asked so l think you're away Zimbabwe is under sunctions and life is a little harder.
08/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Network problem
08/11/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: Good Day, Mr Makwenjere
08/11/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: I understand and are you available now?
08/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Yes
08/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Let's begin
08/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'm now available sir

08/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Wa'al that's great.
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 338 2606: You're the best.
Students must do practicals, it has to balance.
08/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'm pleased that they can work on the Earn while You learn program
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Thank you for such an update
08/11/23, 2:37 pm - Austin: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
08/11/23, 2:38 pm - Austin: @~📖 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'm looking forward for such a door of opportunity to be widely opened sir.
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - Austin: Is there anything that you would like to ask me regarding the Edoofa program as of now?
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Currently everything is clear and l'm willing if you can consider Christian
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - Austin: This is well noted, Is Christian available for the session?
08/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 338 2606: He's preparing to write exams in Monday
08/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 338 2606: He has gone for  revision studies

How are you today?
09/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Thank you so much
09/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 338 2606: I'll be available
09/11/23, 2:26 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Makwenjere! 
How is your day?
09/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 338 2606: It's fine.
How is your day too
09/11/23, 6:58 pm - Austin: Good to know, my day was blessed
10/11/23, 2:17 pm - Austin: @263773382606 As you know, A level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. 

 This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Christian?*
10/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Good afternoon sir
10/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Are willing sir
10/11/23, 3:13 pm - Austin: Good Afternoon, Mr Makwenjere
10/11/23, 3:14 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
10/11/23, 3:14 pm - Austin: Can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
10/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 338 2606: 1. He want to study mechanical engineering
2. In India
3. $6 000.00 to $8 000.00
4. $1 000.00  provided he'll be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn program.
5. It's very clear.
10/11/23, 3:47 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.This can be further reduced through the Earn While You learn Program.
10/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 338 2606: Thank you for point of correction
