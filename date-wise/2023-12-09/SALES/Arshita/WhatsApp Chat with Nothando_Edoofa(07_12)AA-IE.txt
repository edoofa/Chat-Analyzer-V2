07/12/23, 6:39 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
07/12/23, 6:39 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 419 2954: Yes am very much confident
07/12/23, 6:44 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 419 2954: I didn't apply to any university  abroad
07/12/23, 6:51 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

08/12/23, 9:19 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
08/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 419 2954: Yes l have
08/12/23, 10:22 am - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
08/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 419 2954: Ok l see
08/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 419 2954: The network here is pretty bad
