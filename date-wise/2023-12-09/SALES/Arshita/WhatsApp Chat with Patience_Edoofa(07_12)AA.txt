08/12/23, 10:22 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/12/23, 10:22 am - Arshita: This message was deleted
08/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 368 2377: I'm assuring you that I will make it
08/12/23, 10:27 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 368 2377: I haven't applied yet in any University abroad and Nyasha was the one to tell me about Edoofa scholarship
08/12/23, 10:32 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
08/12/23, 10:32 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:33 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
08/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 368 2377: Yes I have finished
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Arshita: Since you are not having Biology at A level, you are not qualified for Medicine. But let me tell you, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, there are courses aligned to the Medical Field itself for which you are eligible and can fulfill your dreams of working in this sector, such as 

**Bachelor of Pharmacy*

*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

*Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*, etc. 

Would you like me to explain any of these courses to you?
08/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 368 2377: So you have to do a combination which have Biology Chemistry and physics
08/12/23, 10:44 am - Arshita: Yes, that is the ideal combination required
08/12/23, 10:44 am - Arshita: You are eligible for these courses.
08/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 368 2377: Here in Zimbabwe there no such combination you either do Maths Physics  Chemistry or Maths Biology Chemistry you cannot do both Physics and Biology it's can't
08/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 368 2377: Okay
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Arshita: I can understand that!
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Arshita: May I know which one shall I explain?
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 368 2377: So I can't to medicine cause of that.l want to medicine and I can't do a combination which involve both biology and physics .
