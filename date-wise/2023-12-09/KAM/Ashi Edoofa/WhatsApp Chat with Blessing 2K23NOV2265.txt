2. Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
