08/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Done
08/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
08/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
08/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Very clear
08/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 121 9040: This message was deleted
08/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 121 9040: So The SOP differs from shool to shool or its just 1 document that covers for all the University application
08/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. It will be one document that will be shared to all.
08/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Thank you. Very helpful you my proceed
08/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
08/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
08/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Indeed l am following. Please continue
08/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
08/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
08/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 121 9040: How much is the Registration fee to be exact or it differ from school to school
08/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. And it is different for each of the universities. I hope we are on the same page here?
08/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 578 8730: Is there an payment plan needed
08/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There is indeed a payment plan where the fees can be paid in the form of installments and it will be discussed in detail in our upcoming future sessions. May I know if you are clear here?

14/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended and I was occupied with a meeting.
14/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
14/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
14/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes we are on the same page
14/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
14/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
14/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

18/09/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Emmanuel,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 121 9040: My weekend was alright sir.
18/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I wanted to ask something may l?
18/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please. I am more than happy to help you.
18/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Can we make my application to be of Jan 2024
18/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know why would you like to proceed with your intake early, dear?
18/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 121 9040: The early the better. Things in Zimbabwe are not going so great and l wish to start my programme soon
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your situation. Unfortunately, the intake of students starts in the month of August for all the universities in India, and you will be required to arrive at the same time as well.
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Ok
18/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are clear do that we could proceed with the session?
18/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
18/09/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
19/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Hi
19/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 121 9040: How are you today @918384048513
19/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Emmanuel,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes we can proceed
19/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: This is wonderful
19/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes that is correct
19/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
19/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes l am ready
19/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
19/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes that is very true one can not study at many universities
19/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes we discussed it
19/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Since l will be starting next year August. May you pliz extend the deadline for the Registration fee from 4weeks
19/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Is it possible
19/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Well understood
19/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!
19/09/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Thank you Good night
20/09/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Good evening
20/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 121 9040: The evening is well.l hope you had a good day too.
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes.l am well preprared
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your concern, we shall indeed discuss that soon by the time time of the payment.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Can you please elaborate furthur
20/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! Let's break down the message for easier understanding:

Registration Fee Due: The registration fee you need to pay is $750.

Reserving Scholarship Seat: To secure your scholarship seat, you must pay the $750 registration fee by the university's specified deadline.

Fee Allocation: When you pay the $750 registration fee, it will be counted towards your first year's total fee, which is $2800.

Remaining Payment: After paying the registration fee, the remaining amount to be paid for the first year is $2800 (total first-year fee) - $750 (registration fee) = $2050.

Payment in Installments: You have the option to pay this remaining amount in two installments of $1025 each. The first installment should be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.

Monthly Installments: The rest of the balance ($2050) can be paid through monthly installments, giving you flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payments before the specified due dates.

In summary, you need to pay $750 initially to secure your scholarship seat, and the remaining amount of $2050 for the first year's fees can be paid in installments: $1025 within the first three days of your arrival, and the remaining balance through monthly installments.
20/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Oky understood.So the $1025  is the one that can be reduced when l get scholarship credits
20/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The above numbers are an assumption after your scholarship has been applied. May I know if we are clear?
20/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes.However l can't seem to get how the Earn as you learn programme will apply to reduce the tution?
20/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will come to that as well. Shall we proceed? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 578 8730: Yes
20/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Proceed
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Let's see if l got you right
750usd registration fee
20/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 121 9040: How much is the visa fee
20/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 121 9040: And the flight expenses
20/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You'll need to budget for the plane ticket, which typically ranges from $500 to $600, and this payment will be due in July 2024. Additionally, for the VISA application fees, it amounts to $83, which will also be due in July 2024.
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Oky noted
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 121 9040: So for now the main priority is the payment of 750usd for registration
20/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct.
20/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

25/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
25/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes please
25/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
25/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
25/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes this is clear so the 750usd is part of the First year tuition.Duly noted please continue.
25/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
25/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
25/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 121 9040: This is clear
25/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
25/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Now it's clear.Ok so incase l pay all the required fees while l am here and l also get scholarship credits.Will my credits be forwarded to the following year fees
25/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, it will indeed be processed for your tuition fees.
25/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 121 9040: All is clear now
25/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
25/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
25/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Duly noted
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes please
26/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

26/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

26/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready for the session?
27/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes lets proceed
27/09/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to review the benefits?
27/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I did. may you elaborate on number 3 of the Benefits
27/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Registration formalities?
27/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Understood
27/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Let me read it out
27/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please let me know when you are clear.
27/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Hello
27/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I have my a level results
27/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed, please excuse me for the clerical error.
27/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes.
27/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I am very pleased my concern is on the payment of the Registration fee is it possible that it can be further broke down to more instalments
27/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed you can break the payment to more installments within the 30 - 45 day period.
27/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Ok
27/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, may I know if you are looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I am ready.I also would like to highlight that you are aware of the current economic situation and it would be and good gesture to bear with me during the payments of the funds
27/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I will make sure l pay up all the required fees. Furthermore...more period to pay will sincerely help as the funds are being raised by the entire extend family
27/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation, you will be well imfomed of the deadlines. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Thank you
27/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 121 9040: If you have any other pdf stuff that l may continue to read l would greatly appreciate it.

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I went through the offer letter yes
29/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I have a couple of questions
29/09/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I saw on the letter hostels.Will l be staying at the university hostel or Edoofa has its own accommodation?

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University. May I know if we can move ahead with the same here now?
30/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 121 9040: Yes lets move on
30/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 121 9040: 1 $900
2. 5 years 10 semesters 
3.300usd
4.
30/09/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
30/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
30/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 121 9040: Oky.So will you assist me in finding a cheaper accommodation
30/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, Emmanuel. The university officials are there to assist you in securing off-campus accommodation as well.  On top of that you would also have the support of the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa in doing so, which means that your initial days here in India will be as smooth as possible. I hope you would be glad to hear that?
03/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Good afternoon
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our conversation regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today @263771219040 ?
04/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 121 9040: Good mrng.Yes l am well clear with the offerletter.
04/10/23, 11:02 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Sorry l have been unavailable. I have been working round the clock so that l get the funds sorted for the Registration. I sincerely hope you understand
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for sharing this with me here dear, I understand that it is quite a task to raise the finances required for your higher education, however, I am confident that you would surely do that. 

Moving ahead, I also had a discussion with Mr. Piyush today, and he informed me that you told him about some challenges that you are facing in completing your registration, hence, can you please let me know of the same so that we can discuss and plan the way ahead for your admission?
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes that is very true
06/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 121 9040: Good morning
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us move ahead with our discussion here. Before we do that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
06/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes l am clear about it
06/10/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 121 9040: We are together
06/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 121 9040: The accommodation outside of campus are not far from the university right?
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmnuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 5:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, coming to your query, yes, please dear, all the off-campus accommodation facilities are situated at a walking distance from the university campus please. I believe you are clear till here please?
11/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
11/10/23, 11:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
12/10/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 121 9040: Ok
12/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Is the due date for the early registration over?
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please we are coming to discuss that. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*

25/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, Emmanuel, as per the discussion that we were having here earlier, you mentioned that you are going to make the payment of the part registration fee on 21st October 2023, can you please share an update with me on that?
25/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 121 9040: It is with a heavy heart that l announce that the other entities that were to help me have since expressed that they are not liquid at the moment.So l think l might have to hault the admission while l look for funds myself. Thank you so much for all the tireless hours working with me.l really apprciate your faith in me and the support you gave me.
25/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Emmanuel, if I may ask, you had mentioned that you are certain about completing the registration by 21st October, now, if I may ask what happened due to which you were not able to do that?
25/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Lack of adequate funding.l have $100usd on my self which l thought would complete registration.
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that Emmanuel, in that case, if you had $100 with yourself, can you please let me know by when do you think you would be able to pay that towards your registration and by when do you think you would be able to raise the balance fee as well?
27/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!

27/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you here again dear. Moving ahead, can you please let me know of this as well?
27/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 121 9040: THE 100USD can be deposited any moment.The challenge that stands is that l do not have the specific date of the day on which l would deposit the rest
27/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Emmanuel, should you not be focusing on at least securing the scholarship seat for now and then moving ahead to plan the remaining balance. Otherwise, what benefit would that planning would give if you won't even have secured your scholarship seat? I hope you understand, right? <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I understand that fully...l really need the scholarship
27/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 121 9040: It's just that the fees are not very affordable.
27/10/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Then, why is it that you did not make the payment of the $100 dear?
27/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I thought that since l am required to pay 300 but l only have 100usd with which is not enough
30/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 578 8730 left
01/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Good evening
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263771219040 I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
02/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Good afternoon sir
02/11/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today @263771219040 ?

02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I was expecting you to respond to this message of mine, it would be great if you do that now please.
02/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Sir,I think l might pause the admission due to lack of funds
02/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I failed to receive the financial support that l needed
02/11/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask how was it that you were preparing to raise the finances for the admission process, and what was the reason that you failed to receive the support that you were expecting?
02/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 121 9040: From the business profits but now there are no profit rather the busines is not in good shape to sustain my higher education
02/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand your situation, Emmanuel. It's unfortunate that the business's current condition is not supportive of your higher education. I'm sorry to hear that the financial support you were relying on from your business profits isn't as stable as you anticipated.

In that case, is there a plan that you have drafted to follow for moving ahead from here?
02/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I was wondering if there are any institutions that offer online programmes so that may plan something
02/11/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, even if the institutions offer online programs, you would have to complete the admission process to get access to that as well, right? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Oh oky
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I can try and push to get the money however my anticipated profits as planned so it is dragging the whole process. My desire is to complete my degree.l will put more effort to get the money

I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: I understand your determination, Emmanuel. If you're striving to secure the necessary funds to support your education, that's commendable.

Do you have any other potential sources or backup plans to secure the required funds?
03/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 121 9040: At the moment unfortunately no
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 5:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 121 9040: Good morning
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Thankyou
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you've had a wonderful few days and a joyous Diwali celebration filled with light and happiness.

As we resume our discussions today, I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the pending matters related to the admission process. May I know if we can resume with our discussions now?
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Ok
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263771219040 Can we move ahead with our discussion here now?
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier when we were connected with each other here, we had discussed about any potential solution to your financial challenges and how possibly could you raise the required finances for Emmanuel's registration process, right?
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 121 9040: That is correct
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, were you able to explore any alternative that can help you in doing the same?
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 121 9040: It is a work in progress
15/11/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what is the alternate solution that you were abel to find please?
15/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I am planning a fundraising event on the 15th December .All proceeds will be channelled towards registration  tuition and other expenses
15/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 121 9040: It's unfortunate that most relatives that had pledged to help me fund my university education are not fulfilling their commitment and l am forced to try other avenue so that l raise bulk of the amount required
15/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that, however, if I may ask, are you certain that you would be able to get the required funds with the help of the raiser?
17/11/23, 6:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes
17/11/23, 7:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How have you been doing for the past few days?
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 121 9040: I am quite well
17/11/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, earlier when we had connected with each other here, you mentioned that you are in process to raise the amount for Emmanuel's registration through a fund raiser, right?
21/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 121 9040: Good morning
27/11/23, 8:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/11/23, 8:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you for the past few days, because I was a bit under the weather and was not working since then. 

Now, that I am well and in a position to resume my work, I have returned here to help you ahead. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 8:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I was expecting you to respond to this question of mine as well, hence, may you please revert to that as well so that we can discuss more on that?
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 121 9040: This is what l am working on.l am not sure how much Revenue l will get from the Fundraiser
28/11/23, 9:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. I understand that you are currently exploring a fundraiser as a means to finance Emmanuel's higher education. While it's admirable to seek alternative avenues for funding, I must express my concern about the feasibility of solely relying on a fundraiser for this purpose.
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Milan Edoofa: The main reasons as to why this does not seem to be a workable plan to me is:

*1. Fundraising can be an unpredictable and time-consuming process* There's no guarantee that you will raise the full amount needed for Emmanuel's education. Additionally, the time it takes to raise significant funds through a fundraiser could potentially delay Emmanuel's admission and academic progress.

*2. The financial requirements for higher education are substantial* Even if your fundraiser is successful, it may not cover the entire cost of Emmanuel's education, including tuition, accommodation, and other expenses.

I hope you understand these concerns?
29/11/23, 7:14 am - +263 77 121 9040: This is very true. May we please stop the process since l do not have enough funds.
29/11/23, 12:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me here. Moving ahead, since you have mentioned that you wish to stop the process, on that note, I believe that even if you choose to stop, you would still be doing something for Emmanuel's higher education right? You won't be putting a full stop on that if I am correct?
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 121 9040: Yes.However as you can note that parents are no longer available. It is just me here
30/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that. Moving ahead, if your parents are not available here, then how is it that you wish to move ahead with your higher education journey?

08/12/23, 5:09 am - +263 77 121 9040: Good morning.My apologies for being quiet lately.l have been working round the clock to make the fundraising come to life.l would like to say l am almost done and l hope it will be a success.
