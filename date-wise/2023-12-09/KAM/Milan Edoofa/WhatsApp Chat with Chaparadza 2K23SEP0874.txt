18/09/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Chaparadza 2K23SEP0874*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
18/09/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Chaparadza EWYL23E0691*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
18/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It's okay I do understand it
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 605 4064: My sincere apologies Ms Kirti for the slow response as I shared earlier, my network is misbehaving
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 that is alright please, I understand that the network can be a challenge, please you may reply whenever you are connected to a stable network.
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted Mam
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes it's clear thank you
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I appreciate your understanding Ms Kirti
18/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, take great pride in your achievements, and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
18/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay Ms Kirti, to start with, i can say that the Edoofa Scolarship Program has 1stly impressed me for its aspect of enthusiastically active in helping out students from across African countries, this has greatly impressed me in the sense that it is an alarm that there is no discrimination in skin color, language nor nationality in India and therefore an assurance of a welcoming and loving community which is something many people look forward to see in any country or community
Also Edoofa has taken my heart away from the 1st sight of the EWYL Program, I am someone who is greatly motivated by helping out my father in any way possible with the issue of my education not only theoretically and practically wise in my academics but also financial wise and I also I believe in Independency meaning to say I believe in enjoying the fruits of my hard work or input and Edoofa is the right place for that, a way to also prove one's worth
18/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I also found interest in that the Heads of Edoofa at a time in the past visited Zimbabwe which in a way makes us to trust the platform
Moreover, the assistants from Edoofa taking you as an example are welcoming and open to queries which is something great
18/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 605 4064: The Edoofa Program gives opportunity to the student to be hardworker preventing laziness through the projects or tasks which they issue out during the process and therefore it removes dependency syndrome for free aid in the future leaders which is something vital for a functional society
18/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Allow me to end by saying that I was also impressed by the flexible payment of the enrolment fee as well as any fee related in future making it possible for the determined to get the opportunity to learn abroad

And have therefore decided to go for Bachelor of Legislative Law after I received my acceptance letter with hope that all shall flow well and seeing myself soon with you and the Edoofa family at large in India
18/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 First of all thank you so much for your kind words, secondly, I am glad to know that you had such a great experience indeed we want the best for you and every student like you so we make it our aim to provide affordable education and even make the student employable ready at the same time through EWYL program, speaking of which I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
18/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed.

That recently I am a bit under pressure from exam preparations since I am starting my Advanced Level exams in October and finishing on the 16th of November so I wanted to know as to how busy will the EWYL Program be so that you can help me with deciding on when to take up the specific procedure since you are well versed with everything 
My only fear is that I don't want to miss out anything regarding this endeavor now reduce my worth fullness of attaining the Scolarship so may you please assist me with that
If it can be manageable like the sessions which I have currently attended then I would like to go for the EWYL Program now because I want everything to be in order and up to date
18/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 I understand that with the upcoming exams, it will be difficult to manage the EWYL sessions, in that case, you can mention the reason and state your EWYL availability date after the exam, since it will be better if you start with the EWYL program with a free mind so that you can actually learn skills rather than just attending the sessions under pressure, right?

I hope you are doing well, 
Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
20/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 605 4064: We are doing well Ms Kirti how are you
Yes you may go ahead
20/09/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Sorry for the late response yes we may proceed

20/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 278 6601: Noted .AC
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
20/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It's clear

20/09/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for delay in response, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 7:32 am - +263 78 605 4064: Good morning Ms Kirti am sorry too for not being available by that time there was a network problem
21/09/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Chaparadza,

I trust this message finds you in good health. That is alright, I understand network can be an issue, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 605 4064: We are doing fine how are you
Yes I am available
21/09/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is good to know, may I know if you have any queries here?
21/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes it is clear
21/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay so is it hinting out that I will be given more than 2 or so universities to choose the one I wish to be enrolled in or?
21/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes I am following
21/09/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
21/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Ok we may carry on
21/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It is clear thank you
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes we may
21/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
21/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
21/09/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes you may
21/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

21/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
21/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*: In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*: Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*: Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
25/09/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you all is clear
25/09/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/09/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes Ms Kirti we are together
25/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

25/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
25/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 605 4064: 2.*Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rigthts*


 *Rights* are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement, that is Rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention or ethical theory whereas *duties* are moral or legal obligation, a responsibility for example obedient conduct due a parent.
 *Human Rights* are principles of freedom inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status and these include the right to life and liberty, freedom of slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to education and work, the right to Healthcare, the right to nutrition, the right to privacy, the right to freedom of association among others whereas *Civil Rights* are an essential component of democracy. They are guarantees of equal social opportunities and protection under the law, regardless of race, religion, or other characteristics, examples are the rights to vote, to a fair trial, to government services and to a public education among others.
26/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 605 4064: 3. *What is the difference between a Prosecutor and an Attorney*

A *Prosecutor* is a legal representative of the prosecution in states with either the common law adversarial system or the civil law inquisitorial system. He or she present at the court during  the trial and state the main points of indictment after the accused is interrogated by the judge. He shall maintain his opinions after the court investigation on evidence shown among others whereas an *Attorney* is someone who is not only trained and educated in law, but also practices it in court lbconcerning legal matters where he or she has duties of communicating with clients ti learn about their legal needs na dconcerns and providing them with advice, developing strategies to resolve cases favorably and cost_effectively for clients, explaining legal options to clients and bringing possible outcomes or threats to their attentions, building relationships with clients based on trust, developing arguments and representing clients in criminal and civil legal proceedings among others.
26/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 605 4064: 4. *Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, corporate, or criminal and why?*

I prefer to pursue in Criminal law which is known as the branch of public law and it has general principles and rules governing and closely linked to all aspects of the individual and social life of citizens.
I wish to pursue law in this branch because it deals with the eradication of unacceptable acts in the community which might be threatening, harmful or otherwise endangering to the property for example Gender Based Violence, Child Abuse, robbery, fraud and corruption among others. This will assure and guarantee me a chance of fighting for justice and creating a friendly environment which is free from any harm with people rest assured of peace where children can be groomed with the parents having no fear of their children being kidnapped or abused as the criminal law will be looking into the eradication and mitigation of dangerous acts. This rest assures the future generations of a preferable environment as well as an eager to fight all the unwanted behaviors highlighted above.
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 605 4064: 5. *What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.*

I believe that my skill in analysis and research will make me a successful lawyer in the sense that let us take for example a client brings a case of being charged with death, due to my skill I will be able to analyse the whole story and research on when the death occurred and under which circumstances in a way getting all the required information to bring before the court session, my skill in time management will also help me to be a successful lawyer in that it will help me to carry a given case and present it at the required date, I also have a persuasive skill which I believe that I will be able to persuade one into telling me all the information required while dealing with a case for example during a theft case I can persuade the witnesses into giving me the information which the culprit might be hiding, a skill in problem solving will help me to bring a case with conflict to resolution after hearing both sides and solving the issue for example property inheritance may be shared equally after being attended by me as well as teamwork skill which for example I will be able to do a certain task and give the other task to someone best in that certain sector interacting well with my workmates, a skill in logical reasoning will also help me for example during preciding over a case I will be able to give a fair trial as a judge due to logical reasoning as well as my writing ability which will help me to present clear and sensible flawing coherent work, thus, making me a successful lawyer

26/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @263786054064 may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 5:23 am - +263 77 278 6601: Mrning Ms Kiŕti .I am closely following your debates @Shallo and 'am happy with the progress so far
27/09/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chaparadza.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to know that you are following along @263772786601. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 278 6601: Not really I have a series of Council meeting ahead of me
27/09/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and It sounds like you have a busy schedule ahead with your series of council meetings, in that case, may I know by when will @263786054064be available to connect with us?
27/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we would definitely be assisting you to chose the best University as per your preference.
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I appreciate
27/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes we are Mam
27/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes I have 
And if I may ask how will it be paid and in what form too also per semester or?
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Yes please let me help you understand. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you please further clarify on
*There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.*

Does it mean the involvement of the EWYL Programme or?
27/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please let me help you explain, As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay
27/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I'm following
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I'm following maybe you may explain further on the admission fee
27/09/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 I am glad to know that you are following along. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/09/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you, yea truly we are excited and eagerly waiting to receive the Offer Letter hoping that it shall come from the university which shall correspond to our status as well as the best
29/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 605 4064: Good morning Ms Kirti, Daddy and colleagues, please do resend last sent messages if there are any which I didn't respond to I was currently facing some challenges with my previous WatsApp bug it's all well now

29/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes I am available to connect with you
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now moving ahead. The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

29/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

29/09/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted
30/09/23, 10:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chaparadza.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Afternoon how are you Ms Kirti sorry for not being available was recently attending an FRS seminar but now free
03/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chaparadza.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.

Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It's okay we greatly understand hope you had a great time 
Yes I am available
05/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chaparadza.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence and not being able to connect with you as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: We are all well and how are you
We greatly understand your absenteeism Ms Kirti for one cannot always be around
05/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: And yes I am available
05/10/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well not, I really appreciate your understanding of the situation and I am glad to know that we can continue with our discussion now. So may I know if you were able to go through all the 7 points by now?
05/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes I did go through all of them
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263786054064 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 605 4064: This is so great to hear
05/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Greatly understood
05/10/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It's convincing and relieving
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 605 4064: This is great
05/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted
05/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 605 4064: So far so good all is clear Ms Kirti
05/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to hear. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Please provide me with the information for I am not aware
05/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263786054064 let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 605 4064: True
05/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Understood
05/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: We are getting along
05/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 605 4064: In agreement
05/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 605 4064: It's clear Ms Kirti but with me don't worry we won't go to such extremes be rest assured of am excellent pass from me
05/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you will not go to such extremes, I belive in you that you will achieve the best grades. 

Moving on to the next point. 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you so much Ms Kriti
Understood
05/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes it's clear
05/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay it's clear
05/10/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes please do elaborate on that
05/10/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786054064 I think you did not understand my message here, what I am trying to ask here is if you have any any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I guess you already tried to higight that so we may safely move on Ms Kirti
05/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes Ms Kirti we are so much happy and eagerly waiting to also receive the offer letter
05/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you so much Ms Kirti I will do greet them and may you too continue with a great night

Okay thank you, duly noted
05/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Sorry to bother you Ms Kirti but u was checking and I saw that it has been 9days since I sent my SOP and haven't received the offer letter yet of which if I recall well you said the universities take 5days at most to open the SOP and then send the offer letter is it or am mistaken and if so then what may have gone wrong if I may ask
05/10/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand that @263786054064however, the offer letter will be shared only after we complete step 4, and since we completed that step today, we shall share the application nows, since we want to inform you about the steps first before sharing the applications.

I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand that.

18/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes we may
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes it is
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Duly noted Sir
18/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: May you please assist me with the progress of the required information too
18/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 605 4064: And progress of this query too
18/10/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, regarding the query about the A-Level Results, I would like to mention that the note that is written in the offer letter means that you would have to submit the A-Level Results before Chaparadza will arrive here in India in the coming year, therefore, it is not a point to worry.
18/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, we will discuss about the registration fee further during our discussion as well. Shall we proceed for the same?
18/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you now relieved
18/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes we may
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes am following
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes am following
18/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
18/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes we are just that we need clarity on when it is due to be paid
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, however, you do not have to mandatorily pay the whole amount since you also have the payment plan with you here. I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263786054064 May I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our conversation please?
19/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Good afternoon Mr Singh
Yes we may nove ahead
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Am well thank you for asking
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 605 4064: No am residing in Zvishavane
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you my Father will do respond accordingly
19/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes you may
19/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 605 4064: But am sorry I will now be able to respond tomorrow for I have some urgent school work to attend to
Stay blessed
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if you parents would be able to continue with the discussion?
19/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 278 6601: Go ahead Milan .I am more comfortable to pay direct to the University if possible
19/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738

20/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we were having here earlier, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Shorwi's details that I shared here so that we can proceed with the discussion?
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!


If I may ask, are we connected with each other here so that we can proceed with our discussion? <This message was edited>
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!

25/10/23, 4:32 am - +263 78 605 4064: And am sorry I won't be available for today's discussion since I have an exam from 9am to 12pm but I hope my father will join in any case if he gets free
Have a blessed day
25/10/23, 9:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/10/23, 9:27 am - Milan Edoofa: First and foremost, I would like to extend my best wishes to you as you prepare for your upcoming examination. Success in your exams is crucial, so please focus on your studies and perform to the best of your abilities.

Regarding our scheduled session, if it is possible for your parents to participate on your behalf, that would be an excellent option. Alternatively, we can reschedule the session for 12:30 PM CAT to accommodate your examination schedule. Therefore, please let me know of the same as per your comfort.
25/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you so much
Am free now we can connect
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today @263786054064 ?
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Am okay Sir thanks and how are you
25/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine as well, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, may I know if you have taken a note of these details so that we can proceed?
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I hope my father has taken the note since he is the one doing all the payments Sir
25/10/23, 4:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please.  For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
25/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you I get it
25/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I also want to ask that is this the money which will also be reduced through my EWYL programme or?
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
25/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Yes Sir it's clear thank you
25/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
25/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Very much relieving thank you
25/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
25/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Am very much eagerly waiting to excel well for I have much zeal to help my Father Sir 
All is clear we may continue
31/10/23, 5:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 5:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that you were having exams, however, I believe that you were aware of the fact that the university has given you the date of 28th October as the deadline for making the payment of your registration fee, hence, can you please share an update with me on the same that if you were able to do that please?
31/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I will confirm with my father and then update you Sir
01/11/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263786054064 May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your father by now and get an update on the registration fee payment please?
02/11/23, 5:23 am - +263 78 605 4064: It seems like he is not in touch for now so I will try to call him and reach out back to you again
02/11/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 605 4064: Hello Sir how are you am sorry nor to provide you with the intended info for am afraid that my father did not pay because he had not feeling well lately and he doesn't have his phone I just heard about it now as am speaking now he is still admitted at the Capital city's hospital so😔

02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about your father dear, what happened to him, is he alright now?

He is btr now but still admitted and he doesn't have his phone because he was in the HDU for critical patients 
Will be updating
02/11/23, 8:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm relieved to know he's doing better now. Given the circumstances, don't worry about the registration fee at the moment. The most important thing is your father's health and recovery.
02/11/23, 8:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once things settle, and your father feels better, we can look into the necessary steps for the registration fee payment. Your father's well-being is the priority. Please keep me posted and don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything I can assist with. Wishing your father a swift recovery.
03/11/23, 5:51 am - +263 78 605 4064: Thank you so much Sir I appreciate, am also home now though I haven't finished with my Exams so that I may also go to the city and see his condition then will go back to school and attend my last exam
03/11/23, 5:54 am - +263 78 605 4064: Morning Sir 
I also wanted to ask that in the case if he hadn't paid the registration fee and intends to pay it once he has fully recovered won't Galgotias University close the offer as it was written in the letter or what will be our next step because my Father very much wants me to study there in all his full strength he has as I also want
03/11/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand the situation you're facing, and it's commendable how concerned you are about your father's health and your education. You're right, typically, universities have specific deadlines for fee payments mentioned in offer letters.

Given your father's health circumstances, we'll take appropriate steps. I'll reach out to the academic board to explain the situation and discuss with them about what can be done in this situation, however, for me to be able to do that, could you please help me in understanding more about by when do you think you would be able to move ahead with the next steps in your admission process?
03/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Okay thank you Sir👏
03/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Allow me please to safely say that maybe from the 17th of November because right now my father is still admitted and without him the one who finances my education am stuck from proceeding but if he gets well before the mentioned date I will inform you so that we can proceed from then
03/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I don't know what your thoughts are 
You may as well share so as to help me if there is any other way out
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>

08/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 605 4064: And again Sir my Dad is not yet in a stable state to be discussed with about the finance stuff when he is still in hospital so I didn't ask him about the registration but lucky enough he is stuck eager for me to study abroad because he informed my other relatives we met in hospital happily that he has already deposited some money required and is left with the $2000 and something which is due till Decembeer though am not so sure whether he had paid the registration fee or not
08/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 605 4064: May you please do confirm that with the University when you are able to 
But the good and relieving message is that he is fully geared to have his daughter study abroad and secure her education as soon as he gets out of the hospital and is fit
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 605 4064: He is *still* eager
08/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the update, Chaparadza. I'm glad to hear that your father is recovering and has expressed his strong support for your education abroad. I understand that he is eager to ensure you have the best opportunity for your education.
08/11/23, 8:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, I was not able to clearly understand what you were trying to say here about your admission process, hence, can you please let me know of that again?
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Evening Sir how are you 
Thanks for asking am doing better and you?
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Mention not Sir
Yea very true
08/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I was saying that I couldn't ask him whether he had already paid my registration fee yet or not so if you may please do check with the University for clear updates till my Father is well and able to connect with us
08/11/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I get that now. On that note Chaparadza, we can only confirm the payment from the side of the university once we get a proof of payment from your side. Hence, it becomes important that you check with your father about that.
09/11/23, 6:36 am - +263 78 605 4064: Morning Sir
It's okay thank you I will do provide the necessary details once he is out of the hospital
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chaparadza!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

Thank you for asking
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 605 4064: I asked him about the paid up slip of the registration fee and he said that he thinks he left it locked in his office of which we can't access it without him around
23/11/23, 8:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, may I know what have the doctors said about him, by when will he recover fully?
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 605 4064: Maybe by next week Friday because he is now having his physio exercises
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. I wish for his speedy recovery.
