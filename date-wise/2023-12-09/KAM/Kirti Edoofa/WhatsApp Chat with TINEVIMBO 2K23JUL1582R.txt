01/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and academic documents, they are duly noted with us. May I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form by now?
01/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Indeed ma'am l was able to fill it
01/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
01/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
01/08/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Science, in Medical Lab Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
02/08/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Yes that's true
02/08/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 954 0434: We are having regular electric power cut so the network connection is poor
02/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand. May I know if we are still connected with each other?
03/08/23, 7:16 am - +263 77 954 0434: Due to the power cut l may be available during the day mam because that's the network is slightly stable
03/08/23, 7:16 am - +263 77 954 0434: Hence l am requesting if it is possible to conduct the    discussion during the day.
03/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Good morning ma'am l will be available from 4pm to 8pm
03/08/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand that power cuts can be an issue. However, please understand that our available working hours are from 12.00 pm to 04.00 pm only and our discussion hours are from 08.00 pm to 11.00 pm and the time you suggested is in between and it will not be possible for me to connect during that time. So may I know if you are available to connect now?
03/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 954 0434: I am now available
03/08/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Good evening my admission officers how are you today
04/08/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 391 1880: We are finding a challenge to do evening sessions.  There is no WIFI at our place of residence. The WIFI is at the school compass which is about 3km from the place of residence.
The school and place of residence is in a farm. The school compass gates are locked at 8pm. If it is possible we can do the session from 7pm to 8pm.
04/08/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 391 1880: There are occasions of wild hogs roaming free at night. May you please bear with us on this issue.
04/08/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I completely understand your concern here, and please be inside during the night time. In that case, we can connect from 07.00 pm, but please make sure that you are available that time.
04/08/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Good evening ma'am
04/08/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 954 0434: I am now available
04/08/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 954 0434 started a call
04/08/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that
04/08/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Greetings mam hope you are well too
04/08/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, since we are connected now, shall we move ahead with the discussion?
04/08/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 954 0434: We can continue
04/08/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
04/08/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Yes ma'am l am ready
04/08/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Ready
04/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
04/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
04/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/08/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Indeed that's true
04/08/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
04/08/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
04/08/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
04/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Understood
04/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Yes he did
04/08/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
04/08/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Understood màam
04/08/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
04/08/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 954 0434: We are clear
04/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 954 0434: That's clear
04/08/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
04/08/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 954 0434: I have understood the whole process
04/08/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
04/08/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 954 0434: I'm glad to know that ma'am
04/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, it was lovely connecting with you today, have a great night!
04/08/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Thank ma'am.same to you
04/08/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.

25/10/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for connecting with you yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.
25/10/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Oh that's great. We normally see these festival celebrations on Indian TV series.
Our electricity power poles have been destroyed by storms. So we have to travel to our nearby town (20km) to get network coverage. The other challenge is that from the 16th of October up to the 15th of November Tinevimbo is sitting for her final A level examinations.
25/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 391 1880: We are very sorry for these erratic engagements. However we shall try our best to keep you posted and updated.
25/10/23, 5:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your challenges, I completely understand that the network can be an issue and I understand that Tinevimbo will be occupied with her exams, and it is alright please, you as parents can connect on her behalf.

26/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Not very much. Is the registration process handled by Edoofa and also is preferred location of university factored in. I mean geographically India is a bigger country and our wish was to have our child learn where accessibility
26/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 391 1880: ... where accessibility is not a challenge
26/10/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please stay assured about that. We will be discussing about that as we move ahead step by step.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Tinevimbo,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
27/10/23, 11:13 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Good evening. Sorry our network sometimes just suddenly disconnected. Yes we are very much with you. We are much humbled by your untiring effort. We are very much impressed and wish to be enlightened more.
30/10/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/10/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sure I am getting it.
30/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I'm following
30/10/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I need to be enlightened on that.
30/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 391 1880: It's now clear. I m moving on with you.
30/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah sure. What will be the way forward then.
30/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Ok
30/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
31/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Very clear on that and quite encouraged.
31/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I am available now. Our network connectivity sometimes just goes off suddenly.
31/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that. 
2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
31/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
31/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 391 1880: That is clear and sound.
31/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
31/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I am following.
31/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 77 391 1880: Not at all. I am following
01/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you are following along since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Good afternoon ma'am
01/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I m now available.
01/11/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As Tinevimbo's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tinevimbo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah sure. Depending on the costs involved.
01/11/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you so much. Have a nice day.
09/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 954 0434: Good afternoon everyone.
I wanted to on what platform is the offer later sent
09/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 391 1880: "Wanted to ask" on which platform is the offer letter to be send.
11/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. The letter would be shared with you through email, however, we receive the letter above we shall share with you here.
11/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. <This message was edited>

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tinevimbo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sorry for the late response. We are so excited with the offer letter and we are still going through the letter as a family such that we can come up with an informed conclusion.
16/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sure I am still online. I read the message yesterday. We are making some consultations.
16/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Per Semester after scholarship tuition fees is 900US
2. Standard Course duration is 4 years (8 semesters)
3. Admission & procedure fee is 300US 
4. Registration fee is 750US
16/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 391 1880: That is clear yes.
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I have a question if I may ask.
16/11/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please @263773911880?
16/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 391 1880: We once asked that if it was possible Tinevimbo may find a place for study where there are some close "associates". Meaning we would like to understand the location of the University relative to some commonly known places like Delhi, Mumbai etc
16/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sorry we may have asked in a not so proper way but I hope you understand our question.
16/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Another question.
Are we going to receive another offer letter or that offer has already started counting on days.
Our concern is on how to forward the payment.
Do we still use our local agent?
16/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Good  day.
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tinevimbo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 391 1880: We are connected. Good day. Our network is very erratic. We are very sorry for the delay.
18/11/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that network can be a challenge. Coming to your concerns that you shared earlier first of all, thank you for sharing these queries with me I am glad to see that you were able to go through your offer letter and note all of these down rest assured that as we move forward we would be discussing all these queries the purpose of scheduling our discussion today was to help you understand the offer letter better and address any queries that you might have now that you have shared these queries you can be rest assured that these would be covered, please. 

Moving forward I would like to inform you that as we start with our discussion I'll help you understand the letter if at the end there is any query that is unattended then we can cater to that as well. So may I know if you are available to start with the discussion?
18/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 391 1880: I am now available. Thank you.
18/11/23, 11:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 391 1880: It's very clear.
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you. That is quite understood.
18/11/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 391 1880: That is understood. Thank you. May I ask for your opinion on the accommodation for Tinevimbo
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I do not know how to about on the registration issue. The deadline and the payment details. Seems the deadline is stated as 15 working days from the date of 'issue'.  Do we use the offer letter that you did send on this platform or we will receive another one through the email.
18/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 391 1880: 'how to go about' it's a typographic error.
18/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off- campus since it is cheaper compared to the on- campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off- campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.

I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
18/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
18/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain, the letter we shared is the same that the university will be sharing both the documents are official please and the date of deadline we are coming to that part of the discussion, i would appreciate you to be patient please.
18/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you so much. We are well answered. Thank you once again its now crystal clear.
18/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to know that you are all cleared. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you. Sorry for being rash. I hope you understand the excitement and anxiety which is associated first time preparations.
18/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah. I am clear on the registration fee and examination fees. Sure that is clear.
18/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand completely,  it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of educatio
18/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah sure. We have noted and  understand the stated amount and deadline.
18/11/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sure I would like to be enlightened on the payment plans.
18/11/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you so much. Thank you. It is now clear and well outlined.
18/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Sure we are in total agreement.
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 391 1880: I stay in Masvingo that is my closest urban centre. It is town which is about 300km from Harare.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you. I have taken note of that. I shall get in touch with Mr Rajan as soon as possible.
18/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah sure. You may do so. I need to weigh the overall cost against travelling costs to Harare which is about US20.
18/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Noted thank you.
18/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you noted and understood.
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Yeah I do understand
18/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 391 1880: That is very clear.
18/11/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you for a clear and elaborate discourse.
Let me go through the details again to make sure we did not miss a point.
Otherwise I would like to thank you for your patience and understanding.
18/11/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
