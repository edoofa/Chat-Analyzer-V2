31/07/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Kunal, and he did brief me about your academic background and career aspirations. I must say, your family, must be proud of you and must be working towards providing you with the best opportunities to kick-start your career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
01/08/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Everything went on just well during my counselling session with Mr Kunal.We discussed about India, the Indian Education system and why Edoofa recommends lndia for higher education.

We discussed the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth and how the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 with the Edoofa scholarship program.

I happened to like about the *Earn while you learn program* most, where l can get to earn scholarship credits based on my performance,the credits can later be used to pay a significant part of my fees lessing my parent's burden.
01/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Providence.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes we may ma'am
04/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 119 5140: I am done ma'am
04/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes it's quite clear
04/08/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/08/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Following
04/08/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah it's quite Clear
04/08/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes ma'am
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - bimol49: You deleted this message
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

14/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay ma'am
14/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 119 5140: I am trying to download it now......but it's downloading slowly
14/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright @263781195140. Let us connect on Wednesday, I hope by that time you will be able to go through the video.
14/08/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay Good night ma'am
14/08/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you and have a great night you too!
16/08/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon  Parents and Providence.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our previous conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Afternoon ma'am
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes l managed to go through all the vedioes
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
16/08/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if you are available to connect now?
17/08/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Providence.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us today?
17/08/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 119 5140: In the first Vedio there were talking about proud Edoofians, the smile on their faces, how they are excited about the Edoofa scholarship program and the whole life in general 

There were also talking about the feeling of Independence in Edoofians and about his visit to some African countries, meeting many  students in Africa.He discovered the main problem which causes many African students not to proceed with their education and this includes *blaming circumstances*

And those students who are more successful in Africa are open minded
17/08/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 119 5140: In the 4th Vedio they were talking about the next action step.

The next action step from my side is the statement of purpose and the next action step from their side is to contact different Universities
17/08/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I shall wait for your response to the other 2 videos.
17/08/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 119 5140: I am unable to hear the remaining two vedioes ma'am
The volume is too low
17/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, let me help you with the understanding. In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
17/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
17/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
17/08/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Thank you ma'am
17/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure, now you understood what message is covered in Videos 2 and 3?
17/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah l now understand
17/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
17/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay noted ma'am
17/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
17/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
17/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. 1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
17/08/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay noted ma'am
I will try to fill in the form as soon as possible
17/08/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to share the academic documents and fill the SOP form by tomorrow 01.00 pm?
17/08/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Will try to make sure that everything will be done by 2pm tomorrow
17/08/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 02.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
17/08/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay noted ma'am
17/08/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
18/08/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 119 5140: I have filled the form and have send my statement of entry , o level results and national I D
The are pics are taking time to send maybe it's because of bad network
18/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. However, I have not received any academic documents for now, may be it is the network challenge that you stated and I shall wait for them.
18/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 119 5140: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 119 5140: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 119 5140: <Media omitted>

18/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 119 5140: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
18/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
18/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Science in Cardiovascular Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
18/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay thank you ma'am
18/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes ma'am
18/08/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
18/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes l am ready ma'am
18/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
18/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
18/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah l totally agree😊
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
18/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
18/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Is the registration fee paid before or after the A level results are out?
18/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since your year of intake is 2024, and as for your A-level, you will be appearing for that this year and so your A- level statement of entry along with your O- level will be required for the universities to generate your offer letter. Hence you will be required to pay the registration fee before the results only once you get your offer letter. 

I hope we are clear here?
18/08/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah it's now Clear ma'am
18/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
18/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah l get it now
Thank you ma'am
18/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
18/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yah it's quite clear
18/08/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes I am following ma'am
18/08/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
18/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 119 5140: No l don't have any queries
18/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
18/08/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay noted ma'am
18/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day and weekend ahead.
18/08/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Okay thank you ma'am

23/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes, I am available.
23/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents that I inquired above?

23/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Wonderful. The image have reminded me of the 6 stages. Providence has not yet been offered a place by any college. I think she is on stage 4.
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we will now be moving on to step 4, before moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
23/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Well. I intend to know whether a place can be obtained using Ordinary Level results at colleges there? We expect to get Advanced level results by mid February next year ( 2024)
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that @263774814386 and I am aware of that, and that is why you can share the statement of entry for A- level because most of the students have them from now.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok I shall ensure that the documents are sent in time. I  want to collect Ordinary level certificate from her school. Last time she sent  results slips . I am quite sure the  exam board released the certificates for 2022 exams. May you also fill me on the number of intakes per year  colleges there offer - is it January and August intake? or August  intake only?
23/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, in India, the academic intake commences in the month of August only every year.
24/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Good afternoon. During our previous conversation I promised to submit required documents this afternoon. My attempts to obtain Ordinary certificate from school was futile because authorities were busy with O and A level exams invigilation. They  that I can get the certificate tomorrow afternoon. May you please extend the deadline to tomorrow evening . In the meantime I have the following results slips👇

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

14/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 509 3718: Thank you for facilitating  my daughter 's  admission . We shall be available for discussion from 1400  up 1500 hours.
15/11/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Providence,

I hope you are doing well. I am happy that you were able to acknowledge the offer letter, that is alright please I am looking forward to connecting with you at 02:00 pm today.
15/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Good afternoon Officer. Upon going through the  offer letter we have noted the following areas which require clarifications:
1. On page 1 it is stated that A level results are required before registration or else admission is cancelled. From our point of view payment of registration fee ( Usd 750)  may only be done when A level results are out . We are expecting to receive A level results latest early March 2024.
2. In our plan and budget we forgot to consider the accommodation fees ( Usd 2000) which is required on arrival at college.
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your queries @263774814386. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok . Thanks.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 119 5140: 1) $900
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 119 5140: 2) 4years (8 semesters)
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 119 5140: 3)$750
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Usd 100 as exam fee per semester.
15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses, could you also answer question 3 What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
15/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 119 5140: $300
15/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes it's clarified.
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Going indendently is good but how will a foreigner be able to make such arrangements so that  accommodation is ready upon arrival there? Is there no risk of sleeping on the street while looking for such accommodation?
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774814386 I understand your concern completely, however, this is not going to be the case, here, we will be assisting you finding the off-campus accommodations after your arrival in India.
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Thanks.
15/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Absolutely.
15/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 481 4386: It is Crystal clear. Go ahead.
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes. Is there a room for paying it in 2 instalment s.
15/11/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to that point as well. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes.
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Thank you very much. It  lessens  the financial burden.
15/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes, we reside in Harare.
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok thanks.
15/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes  as a second opinion.
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 481 4386: It's understandable. Thank you.
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes.
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Let's share insights.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).

15/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Thanks a lot. We forgot to talk about the  pending A level results. Can the college wait for them upto March 2024?
15/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please now coming back to your concern if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
15/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes
15/11/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please have a great day ahead and do convey my regards with your family as well.
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Same to you. Thanks.
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you.
18/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Ok .  Thank you. Wish you a speedy recovery !
20/11/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Providence!

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Good evening . Sorry our phones were switched of  because of   a storm. It was raining here.
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please I understand. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion?
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 119 5140: Yes we are now available ma'am
20/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 481 4386: Yes, you helped us understand it. We resolved to pay the required Usd600.00 in two instalments starting the coming weekend.
20/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

20/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.
