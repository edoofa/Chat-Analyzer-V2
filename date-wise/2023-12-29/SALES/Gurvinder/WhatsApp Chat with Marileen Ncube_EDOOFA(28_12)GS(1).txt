*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

28/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Marileen, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Wessly, is that correct?
