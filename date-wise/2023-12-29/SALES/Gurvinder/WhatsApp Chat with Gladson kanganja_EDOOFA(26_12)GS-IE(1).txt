What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? During my interactions I came to foresee that Edoofa is a scholarship program initiated by that believes that all, not only the privileged deserve some quality, well equiped education and has a foresight of making sure people or rather children should grasp their required knowledge to enhance the World.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I should be accepted in the Edoofa not because of my qualifications but because of my goes and my aim. I would like to help in the upliftment of the world as well as my country Zambia. I feel like I should earn a lot of knowledge for such to come to pass but due to sufficient funds and the scarce knowledge in our country Zambia not only is that but also inadequate resources in our country and so I would love to be given a chance to learn some even more things so I could also aspire as I have been inspired.
