23/12/23, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/12/23, 8:01 am - +263 78 153 0000: Good morning Sir Gurvinder
23/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you the program myself.
23/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 153 0000: Yes ,Sir that is absolutely true
23/12/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Vimbai, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 153 0000: Yes I do
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Now @263781530000, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 153 0000: I go by the name Vimbai Chembwa. I am an 18 year old girl. I love animals and I one day want to own a veterinary clinic of my own.
- Well I just  finished writing my A level exams in November.
- I would like to study veterinary science or geology depending on which subject I will pass more.
- My parents are self employed, my father is a farmer and my mother is a tailor.
-My parents' highest level of education is Ordinary level 
-My father has been paying my school fees.
-My father will be supporting me financially for my higher education abroad.
- I have an older brother who is studying crop science and finishing his university this year but graduating next year. I have a twin sister and she also  wrote her A level doing arts. Lastly I have a younger brother who is doing grade 4.
- I was studying at St Patrick's Mission in Gweru. I payed $450 per term because I was doing sciences.
23/12/23, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study veterinary science or geology, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Well I have not really dug much into geology but judging by how Geography was my favourite subject, I think I would consider continuing with the subject. As for veterinary science, I did mention how much I love animals and my father is a farmer and he owns cattle.  I would not want my father to continue with paying vet doctors meanwhile there is a possibility that I could cut those costs. I want to be my father's veterinary doctor on the side whereas I also have my own work. The program I will get to choose will be the one favoured by my results,  either way will still be content with doing either of those.
23/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: It's impressive to see your drive to balance personal aspirations with family support. Whichever path you choose, your commitment and passion will undoubtedly lead to success and contentment in your career.
23/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
23/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Thank you Sir
23/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 153 0000: No Sir... That is why I would like to start myself so as to guide my younger brother and cousins to aspire to do the same. I believe Edoofa can help me reach my goal.
23/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Okay thank you sir

27/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Noted, may I know, what subjects were taught in Animal science?
27/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 153 0000: Animals in general in our syllabus the ruminant was a cow and non ruminant was a pig. We were taught about how to take care of them in every aspect then their internal systems like respiration, digestive system and more
27/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 153 0000: It has some biology in it too
27/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
27/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Vimbai, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. But if you would like, I can offer you a course in Geography.
27/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 153 0000: I would like a course in geography
27/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:
*Bachelor of Arts in Geography*
27/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Okay thank you what are the jobs associated with it
27/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Yes sir I a confident that I can get more than 6 points
27/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?

27/12/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why, I gave you a full description?
27/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 153 0000: From all these programmes I can choose either one I like?

28/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 153 0000: If I am being honest it's because higher education in India is well known for its affordability  which is an extra benefit in addition to it's high quality.
28/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Well in Zimbabwe not everyone can afford good schools with all science laboratories and chemicals. I would like to encourage the use of technology as an educational tool to those schools. I would do this by donation of tablets and projectors so that the students get to see how things actually happen and get a clearer picture of it. I believe Indian education is so good that I will get the job that pays enough for me achieve this.
28/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Vimbai, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Yes I do
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
