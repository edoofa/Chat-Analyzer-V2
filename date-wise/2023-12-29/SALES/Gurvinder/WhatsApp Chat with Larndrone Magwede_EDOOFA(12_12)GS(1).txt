We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
12/12/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 142 0001: Yes yu are talking to the right person....how are you Mr Gurvinder Singh

12/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Larndrone, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Pritchard, is that correct?
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 142 0001: It's fine
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes it is
12/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So can l ask ...how did yu get in contact with Pritchard
12/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Pritchard, also do tell me whether you learnt about Pritchard’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Nothing much...he just told me the advantages of studying abroad,and he also told me that edoofa is reliable
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Oka yha he once told me about that tooo
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Thank you
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So approximately my fees will be how much per year
12/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please be patient, as everything related to this will be addressed ahead in counselling session.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Larndrone, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 6:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/12/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Noted ...l didn't know that you have your specified time ....l am very sorry
12/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes ...

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
15/12/23, 8:00 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 8:06 am - +263 78 142 0001: Good morning how are you doing
15/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: I am well, how are you?
15/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 142 0001: I am going great
15/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Larndrone, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. 
But seeing your passion for the Subject of Biomedical sciences and your passion for creating your drugs so that what happened to your aunty doesn't happen again, I have a course that would be perfect for you, do you want to know what?
15/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes l would like to know the course
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Biotechnology offers a wide spectrum of possibilities that extend beyond the boundaries of biomedical studies. While both fields delve into the intricacies of life sciences, biotechnology opens doors to a broader scope of applications. Here's why it might be the ideal choice:

Diverse Applications: Biotechnology isn't confined to healthcare alone. It spans agriculture, environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and more. This diversity provides a broader platform for career growth and innovation.

Innovation Hub: Biotechnology thrives on innovation. It involves cutting-edge research, genetic engineering, and the development of new technologies. It's an exciting field constantly evolving with groundbreaking discoveries.

Industry Demand: The biotech industry is rapidly growing, offering vast career opportunities globally. Its multidisciplinary nature attracts employers from various sectors seeking versatile professionals.

Interdisciplinary Approach: Biotechnology integrates knowledge from biology, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. This multidisciplinary approach fosters a holistic understanding and skill set.

Societal Impact: Biotech innovations contribute significantly to society, addressing global challenges like healthcare, food security, and environmental sustainability.

While biomedical courses focus extensively on medical applications, biotechnology provides a more expansive canvas for those passionate about science and its diverse applications. It's a field that propels scientific discoveries and offers opportunities to contribute to multiple sectors, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a versatile and impactful career.
15/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yeah its a gud course but l would like to study biomedical sciences
15/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, since you have understood the potential of the course, the course being finalized to you is : *BSc Biotechnology*
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
15/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 142 0001: No it can't be ....if it is that  my qualifications are for biotechnology then l might go somewhere not lndia it's still okay because l like medicine not biotechnology
15/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So stay blessed l will look for another...
15/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate what do you mean.
15/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel like you have misunderstood.
15/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Oka what do you mean by Bsc Biotechnology
15/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I think l misunderstood for sure
15/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *BSc Biotechnology* is a 3-year undergraduate course that allows the candidates to learn how technology is utilized to create useful and necessary products from living organisms.

15/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 142 0001: As for me l would like to study biomedical sciences which is medicine
15/12/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Well Larndrone as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 142 0001: That one is not a problem..
15/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So if it is l don't qualify it doesn't matter l will try another chance anywhere in the world
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Thanks for your time
26/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Hello
27/12/23, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Larndrone.
27/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 142 0001: Good morning how are you
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 142 0001: I am fine
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 142 0001: Would you still qualify me for biotechnology
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what changed your mind?
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 142 0001: It's like l was thinking to go to Zambia and my parents ain't support education in zambia
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Larndrone, let me tell you that you woul have got admission in medicine there, but I am counselling Zambian students also who share their stories that their elder siblings have done their degrees but still fail to get employment, but here in India, in the final year of the course, every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!
27/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I was also told that by my parents

27/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I was planning to donate chemicals to different schools and universities that is if things go well...
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Larndrone, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I. Agree with yu
27/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/12/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes l used to ask others that same question
28/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I would like to ask so how did you do your things to archive
28/12/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please elaborate your question.
28/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Like l am asking how did you archived maybe in your studies ...
28/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Larndrone, I also did my higher education here in India and focused on learning skills that are practical and essential in getting jobs and getting successful in life.
28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Ok what a vision
28/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes they are
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Ok understood
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 142 0001: It's you can
28/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Larndrone, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Understood
28/12/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/12/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

28/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I think it will greatly benefit me
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Larndrone, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Thank you
