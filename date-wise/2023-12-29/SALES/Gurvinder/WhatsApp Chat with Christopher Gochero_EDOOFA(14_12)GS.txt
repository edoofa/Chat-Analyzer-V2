16/12/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
16/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder, forgive my absence, the network reliability this side is poor so it's really tough to connect, and I really want to talk about the opportunity ahead of me with you, sir. I have relatives in Madokero who can make this easier so on Tuesday I'm going there and I will make sure that by ten I will start chatting with you, if you're comfortable we can even make a video call because they have wifi over there

19/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 597 4800: Hi Sir, was my application complete or i need to do some things to complete it
19/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 597 4800: It was network disturbing me, now i can chat full time
19/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder, my concerns for tertiary education  I needed to secure a scholarship that can help me achieve to pursue a my career in aerospace engineering or mechanical which i can further narrow down to specialisation
19/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 597 4800: Im really concerned with my tuition and how I will be living I'm Willing to work to earn something for my residential expenses and anything i can cover thereof
19/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 597 4800: When you say affordable, meaning I have to pay , how much will I have to pay
19/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 597 4800: null
19/12/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Please let us be patient and continue with your counselling session.
19/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Auxillia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Auxillia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
19/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 597 4800: She told me that there was a program that she wanted me to join which was helping her , because  it affordable to study abroad with a scholarship and a side job to earn while you are attending university
19/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I haven't learnt much about her journey, though she said there are some huddles therein in the way which I'm yet to learn
19/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 597 4800: But I have learnt about the steps to become an edoofian
19/12/23, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 597 4800: It can never be beautifully articulated
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I do not wish to reduce the burden but to eliminate it from my mother's mind  and a lot of other people who , from since I graduated high school, have been asking me what I do I really want that seems to be not working at all, some have already begun encouraging that I find a job and start helping my mother and brother to continue his education whilst I'm working and probably get an on the job training which has also proven difficult in that qualified individuals are also looking for those opportunities, so the competition is stiff
19/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 597 4800: So I wanted to sharpen my skills and make myself a competent individual who can be helpful to give back to at least my community, and then my country, probably make it up to the world, just to give back more than I consume , what some call a positive net contribution to the world , in short just to be helpful
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Christopher, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , number 1, I do not know if the other days count though, but my mom cannot be with me
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: May I know the reason why?
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 597 4800: My mom doesn't have a phone that can go on WhatsApp, and she's is in Bulawayo, I'm in Harare , maybe she can because her friend is on WhatsApp and if we ask her to let my mom join on her phone , I do not know if that works for you
19/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 597 4800: And also , like I said I will be at Madokero where my mom's aunt stays , she said I can use her wifi for this counseling session so maybe I can ask her to join too
19/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Yes please, you can ask your aunt to join.
19/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please add the family members and guardians who will play an important role for your higher education.
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: And notify them to introduce themselves when they join the group.
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Can I get the link of the group
19/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 966 8310 joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 229 7975 joined using this group's invite link

20/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 597 4800: -A first born of two boys, left at 13 by the unfortunate life tragedy when my father passed away, I have a passion for planes. My mother who has only a decent O level education doesn't have any stable career but rather does a lot of things to keep us afloat, from buying and selling maize, poultry though not a constant business and she's a part time domestic worker 
- I have graduated from A level in 2021
- I want to pursue in aerospace engineering
- I was supported by Makomborero to pursue A level and O level by my late grandfather and after him my late step father. 
- I do not have Mr and Mrs Chipare said they would provide support on my journey. 
-  My brother, is about to get into A level. 
- I studied at Kenzim College, here in Harare province, my fees , which changed every term were around $300 USD
20/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I thrive to be ever growing and always better than the person I currently am , because there is always room for improvement. I strongly believe that the more im competent the better I can positively contribute the the world
20/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So May I know what were you studying in Kenzim College?
20/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I was studying sciences, Maths, physics , chemistry and statistics

20/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 597 4800: -So, I started form three at Kenzim from 2018, wrote my O level finals there and then did A level untill final as well in 2021
- From form 1, I was in Buhera at St Moses the prophet secondary up to 2017, then after my grandfather died I moved here in Harare
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 597 4800: It wasn't always what I thought, I wanted to be a pilot and I loved physics ever since I got introduced to it, when I got to A level it was the only thing that was challenging enough. So my accounts teacher , who always encouraged and believed in me asked me what I wanted to do now that I am about to complete A level, my answer was to be a pilot. He told me that was going to be not big enough compared to what I could do with my A level. I thought I love planes , why don't I build them. I had a dream to one day land with a giant plane, just as a surprise ,in my grandfather's field in the rurals. It even got better to build something that I may or may not fly, but certainly love, which is challenging enough.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: It's amazing how your passion for planes and physics led you to consider a career in aeronautical engineering or aircraft design. Sometimes, unexpected guidance or suggestions can open up new perspectives, redirecting us towards paths that resonate even more with our capabilities and aspirations.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
20/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 597 4800: No, not one.
20/12/23, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
20/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 597 4800: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 597 4800: For my form five we didn't do much let m shar my report

20/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 597 4800: That was the only term we were got credited in the report book due to the pandemic
20/12/23, 4:44 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering*
20/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I think certainly
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I sure am, Mr Gurvinder
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?

It often incorporates theoretical aspects, scientific concepts, and mathematical foundations relevant to the field. This program might delve into research, design, and analysis of aerospace systems, covering a wide range of theoretical concepts.

On the other hand, a Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering typically leans more towards the practical and applied aspects of the field. It often involves hands-on training, practical applications, and real-world problem-solving within the aerospace industry. BTech programs often emphasize the technical skills and practical knowledge required for specific roles within the industry.
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 597 4800: This is fascinating and I like it , the practical part especially
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
20/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I had done some homework before, so it wasn't new, of which the practical part of the Bachelor of Technology really got to me
20/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I like it even more
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I see myself as an innovative aerospace engineer growing in my career and seizing every opportunity to be better. Bringing new ideas into the field. Building amazing teams and bringing the best of ideas  into the world. And what I really care about the most is making a positive net contribution. I see myself influencing young minds of that time to do great things despite their backgrounds.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 597 4800: It's not very easy for me to pursue a tertiary education given my family's circumstances, so an opportunity with edoofa is a big positive, given that it's an experience of living and learning abroad with an opportunity to work. It is all an opportunity to grow and certainly having other students who are like me is a connecting point for lasting relations and connections which are meaningful. As well as the leadership of edoofa means proper guidance in terms of career development and opportunities to develop the leadership muscle inside me I believe
20/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 597 4800: As for confidence about achieving above 2 points Mr Gurvinder, I have passed my A levels
20/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 597 4800: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Thank you too
21/12/23, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 597 4800: Good morning, Mr Gurvinder
21/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 229 7975: Good morning Mr. Gurvinder and all in the group.
21/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Morning Dad
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Christopher I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
21/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 597 4800: That's exactly what I'm willing to give and take
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Most importantly, I admire the hands on opportunities that come with studying abroad. I also am very much looking forward to make international connections which are not so easy to develop when I just stick in my country. Studying abroad is a great opportunity for growth because it comes with many experiences  interacting with a new culture, the travel, basically I take meeting new people especially outside my country a great opportunity to grow. The diversity of ideas and the perspectives of a whole new people means self development as well. There is also an opportunity to learn a new language, thus reducing the communication barriers in my career.
21/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
21/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Basically yes, and since change is inevitable, I intend to channel that inevitability in a positive direction. Even though I sometimes think it's too big of a dream, I still intend to bring a platform where there can be ground for practical work, as well as attracting international expertise. During this year I have gone to the rurals to my former secondary school it's quite not impressive how behind they are , with no internet to connect to the various opportunities after secondary and even the awareness of their existence. It's sad how they do not get enlightened about how they can develop themselves into people who can contribute positively rather than getting married right after secondary. I was willing to carry out enlightenment sessions where I make then aware of what's out there in the world, unfortunately the periods were packed so the headmaster said I would have to try maybe during the holidays and I eventually got busy. But with an opportunity to come back as a better individual, I make a great role model and mentor. Even though I was to say I am to bring internet connection and computers to the school, there would be need for money, and now having the competency to work and earn, I can safely invest in the betterment of the education systems especially in the rural areas where I have seen terrible systems.
21/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I think that's but to say the least of what runs in my imagination
21/12/23, 7:26 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/12/23, 8:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Teachers can open the door, but you must enter it yourself.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 597 4800: Good morning, everyone
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but I am under the weather today, so I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

22/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Okay, no problem

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 597 4800: Good morning, Mr Gurvinder and the rest of the group
23/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Christopher, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 597 4800: It couldn't have been closer to what I agree with
23/12/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Yeah sure
23/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Afternoon Mr Gurvinder
26/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now Christopher, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I have no questions for now
26/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 597 4800: According to my research and estimations, it should play around 5000 USD
26/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Okay , I under
26/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I understand
26/12/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Sure, I'm following
26/12/23, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Christopher, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I will definitely like the opportunity for earn while you learn, because I have prepared myself to embrace every opportunity to make me a better version myself
26/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
26/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

26/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I'm a supporter and follower of podcast and webinars and with no doubt that's a benefit
26/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Christopher, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 229 7975: Good afternoon Mr. Gurvinder. 
Yes I am connected and following
26/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/12/23, 9:18 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
27/12/23, 8:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
27/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 597 4800: Good morning, Mr Gurvinder
27/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
27/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 597 4800: Yes, the variety and the holistic environment that is created, a getaway ticket to self development with various view point I can refer to
27/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Alright Christopher, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 597 4800: Yes they will be helping me
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 597 4800: But I will make sure I will work hard in order to reduce the burden for them as well, as significant as possible
27/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
27/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
27/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 597 4800: I have discussed with them on several occasions, but we didn't go into details about the financial aspect, I was hoping for full scholarships opportunities, and now since I have earn while you learn I think I can do my best to reduce the burden and again I will talk to them in detail about it, at least they have the first hand information about the program here on the platform as well
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 597 4800: I'm so ready
27/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Christopher, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 597 4800: From $1500 to $2250
27/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Christopher, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 597 4800: Okay
27/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 597 4800: I'm following, how will I have to pay it and when
27/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 597 4800: null
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 229 7975: Good morning Sir
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: I will explain, but first, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I see it
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Christopher basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Ok, how about for someone like me, who has received their results
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I'm following
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
27/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , I reviewed it earlier on the website
27/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Christopher, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I understand well
27/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
27/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 597 4800: I understand clearly
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
