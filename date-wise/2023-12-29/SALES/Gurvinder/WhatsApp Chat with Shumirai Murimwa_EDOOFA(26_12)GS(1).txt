You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

26/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Sayineti, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, is that correct?
26/12/23, 9:56 am - +27 81 446 5770: Yes true if you can explain it all thanks
26/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
26/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
26/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
26/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 897 7886: OK what r the basic requirements for 1 to apply for the schoolaship
26/12/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Murimwa, as we start Shumirai's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
26/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 897 7886: Yes ll be present throughout her counseling  and eligable process
26/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Murimwa, I would like to know Shumirai better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?

I am also passionate about science and about how the human body works. I am motivated by the challenge of Medicine and how it constantly pushes you to learn and how it pushes you out of your comfort zone so that you can really test yourself in terms of how far you're willing to go
27/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Your drive to study Medicine stems from a sincere desire to help others and make a positive impact. Your passion for science and the challenge Medicine presents truly inspire your pursuit in this field.

28/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 71 897 7886: Good morning m available and ready to participate
28/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Well Shumirai as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
28/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*3. Bachelors in Optometry*
*4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students
28/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Bachelors in Optometry <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Yes I am💁🏿‍♀️
28/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
28/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Yes
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
28/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 771 4609: In five years, I see myself as a well rounded optometrist who is able to provide comprehensive eye care to my patients. My degree will allow me to diagnose and treat a wide range of eye conditions and as a person who also wears glasses I have always been curious of how the human eye functions and what could be done inorder to improve people's vision, as well as recommend the best eyewear and contact lenses for each individual. and if I get into Edoofa's Program it can help me to achieve my dreams by providing me with a learning environment which is crucial to a person's ability to learn and high quality facilities which enable me to learn well without having any disturbances which will help me to pass all my examinations and understand what I would be learning about which would result in myself succeeding in getting my bachelors and going on to help people with their visual problems ofwhich I have always had a passion of helping people <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Shumirai I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Yes I am
28/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Studying abroad can provide me with more job opportunities rather than studying in my country because the job employment rate is very low nowadays and having a more international experience in my resume can make me a more attractive candidate to employers
28/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 771 4609: As an aspiring student wanting to study abroad, I would be honored to share my learnings with my home country. I would first research the specific needs of thsle education system in my country and identify ways that my experiences could help to address these needs. I would also be open to sharing my knowledge and skills with others through workshops, presentations, and other forms of professional development
28/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shumirai, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Yes I do agree
28/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 771 4609: Yes
28/12/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.
