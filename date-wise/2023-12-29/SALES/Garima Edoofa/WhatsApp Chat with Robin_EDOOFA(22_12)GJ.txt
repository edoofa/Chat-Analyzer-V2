22/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 687 8577: Okay....My name is Robin Wilkinson Chamboko a young man aged 21 born on the 1st day of April 2002. I started my high school in 2017 then completed it in 2022 but it was not any easy. I did my passed my O' level with Symbol B in English Language
C in Commerce
C in Literature in English
B in Geography
C in Combined Science
And a C in Indigenous Language. I proceeded to A level....and I got 7 points in an Art combination of History(e)
Family and Religious Studies(B)
Literature in English (D)
It's very unfortunate that my father passed on when I was about to go for form 1 and I had noone to pay for my fees...which was $55 per term. My mother and my father were divorced long back...my mother was and is still a housewife she has never been employed so paying for my fees was something she was totally incapable of doing. Thanks to my nephew whom I only saw once......he is the one who paid for my fees up until A' level but he is no longer capable of paying for my tertiary. The course I always wanted to go is Law. Since I was a little kid I always wished to be a lawyer one day. My weakness i am not so sure but as for my strength.... my strength is my bitter past and it keeps pushing me to looking forward for the best and I am a guy of optimism. My hobbies are singing and playing soccer.
