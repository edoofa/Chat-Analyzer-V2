Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
23/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes i believe  totally
23/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
23/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes i guess icam work  on it
23/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
23/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am i have spoken  to them all  and it is also  their  greatest desire that i get a good education  and might as well excel in life because  of such opportunities
23/12/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: That's great and I thoroughly appreciate their support, Tanatswa.
23/12/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I am confident
23/12/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Electrical engineering?
23/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 799 8533: So at A level i did 
MATHEMATICS  PHYSICS  
CHEMISTRY
23/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 799 8533: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Received please
23/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: I await your response, Tanatswa.

What motivates you to study Electrical engineering, Tanatswa?
23/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 799 8533: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: I can see your great inclination towards the field, Tanatswa.
23/12/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about your desired course.
23/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment.

An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Electrical Engineering has very good career opportunities in professional career such as all power generation, transmission; distribution companies can offer them a very good remuneration as per their skills. Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
23/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Okay thank you
23/12/23, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Tanatswa?
23/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am
23/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same Tanatswa?
23/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am
23/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tanatswa, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 799 8533: growing up i have always admired working  at ZESA and  That fascinated me such that I wanted to understand how electricity works and its management. That led to me doing physics extra research in every topic regarding electricity and I’d like to get more information regarding studies and I believe your institution is where I can get the best education and eventually  i will keep on winning  and with the help of the program   i can study and as well help my parents with fees  since they are getting  old and work is now harder for them  .
Having to work as an electrical engineer  with the knowledge  that its a source of green energy and is now crucial  in our everyday  lives in 5 years time electrical  consumption  will be increased  from now and hence more work for us engineers and more income.
23/12/23, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tanatswa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Tanatswa.
23/12/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Im sorry ma'am   a little bit caught  up with chores i will get right on it
23/12/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Noted please
23/12/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: I await your response
23/12/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I wouldn't  really  say studying   in Zimbabwe  is not okay but according  to my researches  India is one one of the countries  offering  good degrees  in medical  sciences and engineering  as well and with the help of your  Program  my advantage  is doubled on this difficult path so basically  i chose studying  abroad  because  there is  great opportunity  
  for high quality  education 
Since the mordenised world  needs  is now getting  technical more electrical Zimbabwe  is still lagging  on such things  so having a degree  that is highly  recommended   is the reason  why im not opting to study in Zimbabwe
23/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand what you are sharing, Tanatswa and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future too!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
23/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I  trust i have  stated above  
 The degrees   from India  are highly recognized in other  countries  , so basing on this analysis    achieving my dreams  outside of Zimbabwe will  be easy
23/12/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see your awareness, Tanatswa. <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

23/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Thanks you ma'am
23/12/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

Did you thoroughly follow through the shared resources, Tanatswa?

If so, did you find them helpful and interesting?
23/12/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I just loved the facts that  india is culturally diversified  so it wont be so hard to find a  conducive environment  that i can work with
23/12/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 799 8533: No not really   it would  be helpful  ma'am  if you show us
23/12/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
23/12/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/12/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/12/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/12/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Oh okay so  i wanted to ask if the program also caters for medical aids  or not
23/12/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/12/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Medical insurance is a vital part of being an international student. It is designed to provide financial protection in the event of serious illness or injury that may require medical care. Without medical insurance, international students may be responsible for the entire cost of medical care, which can be very expensive.

Medical insurance can also provide financial protection in the event of a medical emergency. This can include hospitalization, surgery, and other treatments that may be required for serious illnesses or injuries.

Medical insurance can also provide access to specialized medical care that may not be available in the student’s home country. This can include mental health services, reproductive health services, and other specialized care.

Basic university expenses which is included in your annual fee after the scholarship, includes that aspect as well please!
23/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I understand  thank you
23/12/23, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
23/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I have heard  about  the earn while you learn its satisfying
23/12/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, that's great!
23/12/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/12/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I agree  it is reasonable
23/12/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: These are costs for Zimbabwe, Tanatswa.

Considering the costs there are the inflation that is happening along with fee hike every year.

Are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education abroad affordable and accessible for international students in India along with the opportunity of Earn While You Learn Program?
23/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes  ma'am  i now understand
23/12/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/12/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/12/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/12/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/12/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Okay i see
23/12/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

23/12/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes
23/12/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I understand
23/12/23, 8:39 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes
23/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Almost $3000
23/12/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/12/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/12/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tanatswa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 799 8533: I think so
23/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
23/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/12/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am  noted
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Okay thank you
23/12/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Tanatswa.
23/12/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/12/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/12/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
26/12/23, 11:34 am - +971 52 591 2046: I totally  understand  but will you allow  her to be escorted by a family  member  so that we can be assured  that she is in this country at this particular campus.
26/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the same?

26/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: However, my query is regarding your understanding of the financial implications please?
26/12/23, 11:42 am - +971 52 591 2046: yes I do
26/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Are you clear with the same please?
26/12/23, 11:42 am - +971 52 591 2046: yes
26/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: So are you clear that program assists with scholarship on Tuition fee itself, Ms Mildred?

26/12/23, 11:51 am - +971 52 591 2046: Thank you so much for this
26/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
26/12/23, 12:04 pm - +971 52 591 2046: okay I understand
26/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: That's great
26/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Let me get it evaluated.
26/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 799 8533: IS IT TRUE THAT MANY AFRICANS  HAVE POORS DIETS BECAUSE THEIR FARMS ARE STAGNANT AND INEFFICIENT 

Farming has always been recognized as the breadwinner  job in Africa   especially  in Zimbabwe. Farmers  always had the upper hand in the society   given the circumstances that  they own land which is a generational  asset .

Africa is still a developing  continent  therefore  civilization  still lack hence the audacity to have good diets is beneath us .Looking to a time where corruption  was less in the agricultural sector and farms were equally given to people  ,Africans could  actually  eat  their desired meals  rather than nowadays where they are only giving  farms to a few people  and basically  they are the richest.  The farming system  is alway influenced  by climate change so basically  good harvests are  seasonal . Droughts ,insects and pests have been a bother to  farming  system  since little harvest  are produced and hence chances of getting  a good balanced  diet are slim .

However  the land here in africa  is known for being fertile  and efficient   but if not used correctly  the land becomes useless   mostly when crop rotation is not practised perfectly  , soil erosion  occuring because the land is left bare for too long,probably its lack of knowledge  on how to use the farms properly and wisely . Sometimes  good harvests are made , the food is processed  and is put in stores and grain marketing boards  for selling  and profit  making  at higher prices so its becomes difficult  for middle class people  to have  good meals and diets  because  of the expenses in big families . As seasons also chance in Africa  , inflation  problems  arises as some food items are only abundant in specific  season  and the poor  people  are forced  to eat what they can only provide  which is less expensive  food and poor diets  .

Instead  of crop harvests ,meaty foods are also required  to produce a balanced  diet , not every household  have domestic  animals in Africa some people  purchase  meat in butchers and stores  which is not something  that can be done daily   due to  having big families   many responsibilities  to take care of , parents find themselves  in positions where the remove other luxurious food items on the budget  list and hence poverty  also disturbs  chances of having  good and rich diets.

Hence  it is not true that many Africans have poor diets because  their  farms are stagnant  and inefficient .

26/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 799 8533: Okay
27/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 799 8533: Yes sure , good morning
27/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Tanatswa, I have received the evaluation of your test.

Moving forward I would be discussing regarding the interview and if your parents are ready and willing to move ahead with the process.

Are they available for a discussion now please?
27/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 249 0875: Yes meam
27/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 799 8533: Yes
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

27/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 929 6609: Okay ma'am
27/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 2nd or 3rd January 2023 for $200 and the 2nd or 3rd February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 2nd or 3rd January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
27/12/23, 11:00 am - +971 52 591 2046: option 1 please
