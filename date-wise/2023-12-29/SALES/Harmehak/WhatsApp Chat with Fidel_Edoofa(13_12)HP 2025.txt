14/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

I appreciate their support.
14/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
14/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Ohh know i understand... tht explains the limited number of students u take in....thank u for tht i will aim higher
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: That's great
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Social work?

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
15/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 839 5504: Yes let's commence
15/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: So were you able to go through the shared video, Fidel?

15/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 839 5504: Thank you
15/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 839 5504: Pardon me am not getting it
15/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: I received your results.
15/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: So did you ever happen to research about your desired course?
15/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 839 5504: Yh i did....but didn't dig in to much information
15/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 839 5504: Thank you ma'am
15/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Alright please
15/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
15/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
15/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
15/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 839 5504: Thank this has shifted my perspective always thought sociology was just a school subject but if I can take to carrier wise i will go for it
15/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I appreciate that you are willing to learn more, Fidel.
15/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 839 5504: Definitely
15/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Along with the same what are your thoughts on pursuing a career in Law, Fidel?
15/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 839 5504: Law was my first career choice... however due to the fact that i want to study abroad chances of me  getting employed in my country are slim
15/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: You see Fidel, you only have to get your degree evaluated in your country and appear for the bar exam.

Considering your aspirations you should definitely pursue Law itself!
15/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 839 5504: Okay but I wld love to persur criminal law
15/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Sure please,

Shall I brief you about your desired course?
15/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 839 5504: Yessplz

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

Who is gonna have an impact in the world.However this will depend on the job opportunities that i will be offered .Furthermore.. wld also like to use my life to preach n inspire the next generation on hw edoofa came to my rescue after my life to  a dark turn
15/12/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: That is really great Fidel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/12/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
15/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 839 5504: Zimbabwe is currently facing, facing hyper inflation n last time i checked the employment rate i the whole country ws just 10%. I couldn't not believe my own eyes Soo i deviced  a min study case on Msu and NUST former students ....most of them have turned to vending gambling despite the fact tht they have they're degrees at home ....and some have also migrated to other countries like South Africa, Zambia, uk. American to attain employment.the above view is supported by Nurse migrating form Zimbabwe to Uk Soo as to fetch employment. However,things have taken a dark turn for them in the UK.

In in Zimbabwe the university are very expensive and my family wouldn't be able to afford their tuition
15/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: You see, Fidel, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
15/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 839 5504: Perfect analysis unemployment arye is something else in Zimbabwe
15/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 839 5504: Thank u
15/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Fidel.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
15/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 839 5504: India offer higher education....it is also recognized by the globe since it was one of the countries which has managed to lend on the moon....also admire the  their culture in as far as socialization is concerned.According to my research India has a stable economy meaning tht chances of employment are high.there fore thi wld be of benefit since careers are secured after graduation.
15/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Fidel.
15/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

15/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct,

I am glad you remember details.
15/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Very true
15/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Thank u ma'am
15/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Fidel.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Ensure active participation, Fidel.
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 839 5504: No we are not
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 839 5504: My apologies ma'am am currently facing network challenges
15/12/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
15/12/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Fidel, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Noted
15/12/23, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/12/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Plz be patient with me today it's raining n therefore this has disturbed the network waves
15/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I understand, Fidel.
15/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 839 5504: I personally love the idea of the learn and earn program since it's gonna help or.. reduce the load on our parents.... therefore having said tht i also look forward to attaining the 100% schoollarship
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Amazing
15/12/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Fidel_Edoofa(13/12)HP" to "Fidel_Edoofa(13/12)HP 2025"
15/12/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes, you begin while you are still in Zimbabwe
15/12/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
15/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Noted
15/12/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Noted I will keep tht in mind.... could plz elaborate further on accommodation expenses and e.tc
15/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: *If you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, 

*Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition, Basic university expenses including Gym, Laundry, Library, Wifi.* <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 839 5504: Okay noted
15/12/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Fidel?
18/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 839 5504: Yes i have been
18/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 839 5504: Ready
18/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Fidel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 839 5504: $ 1500 to $2250
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: You see, Fidel, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 839 5504: Great u pay the enrollment fee first before anything else
18/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: You pay the fee after being found eligible.

18/12/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Dear Fidel,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “19-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

19/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Fidel and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
19/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 839 5504: Lets proceed
19/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: So Fidel, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
19/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 839 5504: 3.... Questions were raised on the financial aspects...In relationship to the cost of living in India , accommodation, before one obtains a fully funded schoollarship...... Furthermore they also acknowledged the first point ( about the edoofa program and it's vision making education affordable and employment ready)......
19/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Fidel?
19/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 839 5504: From my point of view i told them ... tht one can be attain  a fully funded schoollarship (90-100%).if they are found eligible through their performance at a particular university....
19/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: What is your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Fidel?
19/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 839 5504: A fully-funded scholarship is a scholarship that provides enough money to cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition, room and board, books, and other associated expenses.In this case edoofa only provides these depends on the students performance at a particular institution
19/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
19/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: We discussed 90-100% scholarship please,

Edoofa doesn't provide sponsorship.

19/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 839 5504: Yes now I understand, let's proceed
19/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: That's great
19/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: So now do you have any queries for me, Fidel?
19/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 839 5504: Thank for the illumination ma'am
19/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 839 5504: All good ma'am thank you
19/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Fidel.
19/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Would your parents like to ask anything, Fidel?
19/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 839 5504: Currently they are both offline but i think they will follow through the conversation when they are not understanding will make sure tht i explain..it to them

19/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

27/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Okay so Fidel, meanwhile, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
