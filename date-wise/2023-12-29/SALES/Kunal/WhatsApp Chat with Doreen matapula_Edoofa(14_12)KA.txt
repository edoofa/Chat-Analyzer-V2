As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
28/12/23, 3:01 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That's an excellent question. For starters, I see myself pursuing my studies further by becoming a medical student after graduating from my bachelor's in Cardiovascular Technology. Finally, being an Edoofian will help me in getting into schools that I would like to pursue my career in more easily. I also feel that being an Edoofian member will make it easier for me to reach out of my dreams in becoming a medical doctor.
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: My apologies for the delay
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?

Indian schooling has achieved worldwide acknowledgment with its recognized decent variety of character. Diversed educational planning bodies administer the institute instruction scheme in India. I have also researched that India has a publicly funded higher education system that is the third largest in the world.

28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/12/23, 4:17 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Allow me to first answer how I aim at achieving my career aspiration from studying in India. Firstly, studying in India is a privilege for me. However, I shall return to Malawi with a new perspective on culture, language skills, independence, and being a role model to many other children who have aspirations just like myself. 

And to answer how studying in India will implement a positive impact on my career...Having to study India will enable me to get a job much easier and faster than expected after graduating.
28/12/23, 4:25 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
28/12/23, 4:37 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I am aware of the fact that having a scholarship as an international student allows the student to concentrate on their careers and studies rather than worrying about how they will pay back their loans. Scholarships make it easier to pursue education and career goals by breaking barriers. What I am not aware of are the costs of being an international student without any scholarship. Can you please break it down for me.
28/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 5:22 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Honestly speaking, I really can't say because I feel that my family can afford the reduced fees, but as the question suggests, "family," it is essential to discuss this with the family. So, prior to answering the question, we need to discuss it as a family
28/12/23, 5:33 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board meeting. Let us connect at 6:40 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

28/12/23, 5:38 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Sure
28/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kunal: Good Evening
Shall we proceed?
28/12/23, 7:01 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Good evening. Let us proceed
28/12/23, 7:24 pm - Kunal: I can understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
28/12/23, 7:36 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: No, I do not... please elaborate
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
28/12/23, 7:48 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Yes, I think it would. However, each person has different strategies on which they do their studies, and presently, I have learned my strengths and weaknesses in what I do. What I know is I cannot manage two things simultaneously. My family and I have discussed the Edoofian scholarship and we have concluded that it is possible to afford for the payments.
28/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/12/23, 7:51 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I think that you have not understood me but I am not willing to work while doing my studies
28/12/23, 7:52 pm - Kunal: I can understand your concerns about facing the pressure of studying and working simultaneously. It's natural to want the best possible environment for your education. However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, like the one offered by Edoofa, is designed to strike a balance between work and study, ultimately benefiting the student in several ways:
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: Financial Support: The program provides an opportunity for students to earn a portion of their tuition fees through part-time work, reducing the financial burden on their families. This can alleviate some of the financial pressures associated with education.

Practical Experience: Part-time work allows students to gain practical work experience while pursuing their studies. This can be a valuable addition to their resume and prepare them for future career opportunities.
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: Time Management Skills: Balancing work and study teaches students valuable time management skills, helping them become more organized and efficient in managing their responsibilities.

Independence and Responsibility: The experience of earning while learning can foster independence and a sense of responsibility in students, as they learn to manage their finances and make informed decisions.
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: It's important to note that the work component in programs like this is typically structured to be manageable, so it doesn't overwhelm students or interfere with their studies. Additionally, Edoofa is committed to providing the necessary support and guidance to ensure that students can successfully balance work and academics.
28/12/23, 7:55 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I understand the emphasis but I am not interested in the "Earn While You Learn" program
28/12/23, 7:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:59 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Wow that is indeed inspiring but we are also two different people what might work for him would not work for me but I'd rather stick to what's best for me
28/12/23, 8:04 pm - Kunal: That is absolutely understandable and the EWYL program is optional Doreen and not mandatory. But do you wish to be engaged in practical learnings and skill development programs within your course?
28/12/23, 8:05 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: What are they about?
28/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kunal: The purpose of the EWYL program isn't just about the earning scholarship credits but focuses on the holistic development of each Edoofians through webinars, skills development programs, seminars, campus visits of our mentord, one on one training and assistance etc
28/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kunal: Thereby within the span on your course, our team ensures that you possess employability skills
28/12/23, 8:38 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That sounds pleasant...
28/12/23, 8:39 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: How does one officially become an Edoofian? From the sessions?
28/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*
