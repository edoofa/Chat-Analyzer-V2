*"Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom." - George Washington Carver*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
28/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 277 4818: Yes
28/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
28/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 277 4818: I'm good and you?
28/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
28/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: So, before we begin the session, shall we add Mr Charles and Chamaine to the group?
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 277 4818: Yes but Mr Charles is out of network
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - Kunal: In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
So, shall we add them?
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 277 4818: Add Chamaine only
28/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add Mr Charles as well because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
