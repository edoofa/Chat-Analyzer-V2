22/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 375 1398: Yes we may proceed
22/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 274 2387: Good morning, we may proceed thank you
22/12/23, 10:41 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
22/12/23, 10:41 am - Kunal: Alright please
Let me share an FAQ document about the Edoofa program and I want you to go through it and have a discussion regarding the same
22/12/23, 10:42 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 375 1398: Noted
22/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 375 1398: I have read the document.
22/12/23, 1:28 pm - Kunal: Alright Bhekumuzi
Please share what you have understood from the document in detail
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 375 1398: 1.I understood that some people think and assume that a scholarship is a charitable organization which is said to be not true, one should also understand that the $10 million scholarship fund is not from a charitable organization but it is from a parent company by the name of Anhad Edutrain Solutions which was brought about in 2009 

2. I understood that India is recommended for having English as the primary medium of communication and its cultural way of living 
And India is also recommended for its Hospitable and friendly citizens
3. I also picked on that after obtaining a scholarship you still will be having $2000 - $3000 cost and expenses per year and this is after Edoofa has found you eligible for the scholarship
4. I also understood that there is a program known as the Earn while you learn program where one is assigned to real time projects in which your efforts after completing the assignment earn you scholarship credits that help in covering part of your school fees and also the assignments live you with lifelong experiences in certain work fields
5. I also picked on that international students are not allowed to work part-time or full-time jobs as they came into the country with study visas and not work visas
6. Another aspect I understood was that of the admission process which consist of six stage namely 1.Personalized counseling sessions, 2.Eligibility check test and interview, 3. Acceptance into the Edoofa program, 4.Enrollment into the Edoofa program, admission process after the enrollment into Edoofa program and lastly 6. Admission letter and visa
7. I also understood that there are over 250+ universities in which one could get admitted into ,and all universities being government recognized 
8. Another important factor I understood is that when one misses the deadlines which are very crucial their offer letters are to be revoked but that doesn't affect the eligibility of the student and that can be rectified and discussed with your counselor and the academic board 

And I also picked a few wonderful remarks from the Edoofian student community where some students share their wonderful experiences with them being part of the Edoofa scholarship program.

26/12/23, 10:45 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
26/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 375 1398: I clearly understand and I am confident about achieving it
26/12/23, 10:50 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
26/12/23, 10:50 am - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests and passion, you are eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Arts in Sociology*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
26/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 375 1398: Yes may you please explain in depth

*Career Options in Sociology*
Sociology, as a career, is both impactful and fulfilling. Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.

Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:

1. Social Worker
A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.

2. Journalist
For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.

3. Administrative Support
Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.

4. Rehabilitation Counsellor
If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.

5. Family Counsellor
Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.

6. Survey Researcher
As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.

7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist
A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.

8. Policy Analyst
Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population

9. Media Planner
A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns
26/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 375 1398: Thank you for the explanation Sir, it has shed light into my understanding of Bachelor of Arts in Sociology
26/12/23, 11:27 am - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
26/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 375 1398: So, in five years after my course, I see myself working in my dream job, attending graduation school, traveling the world in means of sharing and gaining experience along the way.

Being an Edoofian can be a great way to help me achieve my career goals in a number of ways. First, it would provide financial assistance that can help me cover the costs of my education. Second, being part of the program gives me access to a global network of like-minded individuals who can provide support and guidance. Third, it would expose me to offers career-related resources and opportunities to help me gain valuable experience and knowledge. And lastly, being an Edoofian would give me the chance to develop my personal and professional skills through various activities and experiences.
26/12/23, 11:58 am - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
26/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 375 1398: After carrying out a bit of a research on India and the Indian Education System I got to learn that India is a diverse and culturally rich country located in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by land area and the second-most populous country in the world.

Indian culture  encompasses a wide range of customs, traditions, and beliefs. The cuisine varies greatly across different regions, with common ingredients including rice, lentils, and a variety of spices. Some popular Indian dishes include biryani, curry, and samosas. India is also known for its rich and vibrant languages, with over 1,600 languages spoken across the country. Major languages include Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, and Telugu, among others. The diversity of Indian culture, food, and languages reflects the country's rich history and heritage. India has always proved and continues to show its great strength and dominance in the sport of cricket.Cricket is the most popular sport in India, with a large and passionate fan base. The Indian national cricket team is one of the most successful teams in the world, and cricket matches are often viewed as national events. Cricket also plays a significant role in Indian society, with many people seeing it as a unifying force that brings people together regardless of religion, caste, or class.

I also learn that India has a very broad and fascinating system of education. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) oversees the education standards for both public and private schools nationwide. Primary school lasts for five years, followed by three years of secondary school. After that, students can choose a three-year Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or a two-year diploma program. There are many public and private universities in India offering educational programs from undergraduate to doctoral studies. The Indian education system is recognized for its high academic standards and emphasis on practical learning.

Overall, the Indian education system is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs of society, with a strong emphasis on academic excellence and holistic development of students.

26/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that, Mr Wonder
26/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Studying in India that can positively impact my career as India is an emerging global power, so studying there can provide me with valuable experience and connections that can help me in my career.

26/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
26/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 375 1398: The costs for tuition fees may range between $2000-$4000 and the accomodation and food cost may vary from $600 to $1500 annually
26/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Thank you Sir, I now have an idea about the costs of higher education in India
26/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
26/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 375 1398: I honestly do not think they are able to pay the fees since they are both doing odd jobs in South Africa and I can literally say my father is the one who gets little income from his gardening services and my mom gets income after a while as she is diabetic and does people's laundries when she feels better
26/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 375 1398: I briefly know that there is a Earn While You Learn program were one is given assigned with real time projects in which after completion of the assignments you can earn scholarship credits which help cover the tuition fees
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: That is right

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:42 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
26/12/23, 1:42 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
26/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Yes from the interesting information above it proves to be a very beneficial program
26/12/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Do you immediately start the Earn While You Learn program or you have to wait for wait for a while before starting the program
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that just after the student is enrolled in the program, he/she will be starting the EWYL program while being in their country
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
26/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 375 1398: I like the fourth point as it ensure the wellbeing of the student and gives them assurance that they are in safe hands
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education,services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
26/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 375 1398: With the information and explanations you have been/are providing I think my father can help me with the remaining fee
26/12/23, 2:34 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 375 1398: My parents have highlighted that studying abroad is not a problem and a good move but as long as I am safe then they are good
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
26/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 375 1398: 1. Application form
2. Biograph essay
3. Recommendation letter
4. Sponsor letter
5. Passport
6. Visa
26/12/23, 2:53 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
26/12/23, 2:53 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 375 1398: I understand Sir
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/12/23, 3:47 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Sorry for the late reply my network was a bit down
26/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Ii understand sir
26/12/23, 5:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 274 2387: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 375 1398: We have discussed up to stage 2 which the eligibility check test and interview
26/12/23, 5:28 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Yes you can go ahead and explain sir
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
26/12/23, 5:29 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
26/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 375 1398: It is quite clear Sir
26/12/23, 6:30 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

28/12/23, 3:47 pm - Kunal: If we begin your eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if you qualify for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the first week of January.
28/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 375 1398: Okay that's where their challenge is as they are highlighting that they've got no spare money to cater for that as they have to pay for my 2 siblings

So may I know by when they can raise the enrollment fee?
28/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 375 1398: That I hadn't asked them, I will have to communicate with them so they can let know when they can raise the fee
