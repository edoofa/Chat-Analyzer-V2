08/12/23, 8:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin with the session,

Shall we begin the session?
08/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yes let's begin
08/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 459 3605: Good morning
08/12/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 696 6271: Good morning

08/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 459 3605: <Media omitted>

08/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Please let me know why the grades are low?
08/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 459 3605: On an honest note I would take full blame for the low marks in biology I didn't really understand a lot of biological terms though it's my favorite subject I also had poor answering techniques at times I will be knowing the answer but fail to express it in geography our teachers got changed during the course of which we hadn't done the whole physical geography part and not yet started human geography so the new teacher made us write a full paper to test our ability then crop science my teacher had a leg injury didn't come to school and had to take a maternity leave after that so we wrote what we knew in the test
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Kudakwashe, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 459 3605: Im confident I will get the required passes
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 459 3605: No I haven't done that
08/12/23, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 459 3605: Thank for let me go through it
08/12/23, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know once done
08/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 459 3605: Oky I will let u know
08/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 459 3605: I have read through thank you for sharing this information
08/12/23, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kudakwashe
08/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yeah
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kudakwashe, I would like to know that if you were interested in Medical field, so, why haven't you opted Chemistry and Physics in you A Level?
08/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 459 3605: I
That's because I had a D in both subjects during my O level
08/12/23, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I do understand!!

Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
08/12/23, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 459 3605: We not aware of that
08/12/23, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kudakwashe, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
08/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 459 3605: During the semester do students take breaks and go back to Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Kudakwashe
08/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 459 3605: So the $2000-$3000 per year can you please break it down for me
08/12/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: They will be having the summer and the winter break in which they can go back to Zimbabwe and visit their families.

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
09/12/23, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
09/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yeah those are required
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 696 6271: We support her all the way
09/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate that, Ms. Tsitsi.
09/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain further!
09/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
09/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yes I do understand but please explain
09/12/23, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through above information and let me know if you have any queries?
09/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 459 3605: I don't mean to be impolite but in case I fail whats the guarantee the money will be refunded
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are you referring about failing in Academics or failing to qualify for the scholarship?
09/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 459 3605: I must admit the earn and learn program is indeed to my benefit
09/12/23, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!!!
09/12/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 459 3605: I mean both
09/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 459 3605: Since we talked about the formalities I think we on stage 5
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 459 3605: Yes please explain
09/12/23, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
09/12/23, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
09/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 459 3605: Yes it's loud and clear
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per your understanding, what are the minimum academic requirements to qualify for the program?
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: and Regarding the second concern, you are supposed to pay the enrollment fee only if you qualify for the program after the eligibility check process otherwise your application will be revoked and you won't have to pay anything
09/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 459 3605: 2 A level passes are required since I wanna be in the medical field I should pass  biology
09/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 459 3605: Ohhh I understand
09/12/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
09/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 696 6271: I have this question.lets say Kudakwashe wants to be a medical doctor bt she failed physics & chemistry is no bridging progame at these Universities to help her pass those subjects at studying her medicine degree
09/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 696 6271: Is there no bridging course
09/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Tsitsi, Please note that To pursue studies in India, students are required to pass A-levels in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Additionally, they must secure a higher rank in NEET, the medical entrance exam that determines eligibility for a medical career in the country.
09/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 696 6271: Ok understood
09/12/23, 2:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Tsitsi, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*

10/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 71 459 3605: we discussed about the benefits of the scholarship we discovered it is legit . Most of the benefits goes to us the payment plan is also reasonable and not so straining we also discovered that the learn and earn program which can helpe earn points and reduce my annual fees is also great apart from offering scholarships we also discovered that edoofa also offers employment chances rather than jus studying and at the end have no job India is also a democratic country providing a violent free environment for my studies apart from studying I will also learn a lot about the mesmerizing geographical sites in India since India is well known for having highly educated doctors make my dream be a reality
10/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 696 6271: Good evening
10/12/23, 6:06 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!

10/12/23, 6:31 pm - Austin: Good to know, I am doing well!
10/12/23, 6:32 pm - Austin: This is well noted, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
10/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 696 6271: We are all on line but I think we are experiencing network challenges
10/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 696 6271: I think the enrollment fees & cost of education are very reasonable in that we are able to pay it for example the $350 usd we can pay at 200usd in 7 days then the 150 usd we can pay it 30 days later also on the tution fee I understand as soon as my daughter is eligible to this program she is taught on line courses do that she will be able to work in order to gain points to be credited on her fees so that by the time she starts her program in August 2024 she will hv managed to pay some of her fees
10/12/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 696 6271: So I think this program is very affordable
10/12/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: That is excellent understanding of the program!
10/12/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
10/12/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: So,Kudakwashe, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

Are you clear about the same?
10/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 696 6271: Kudakwashe sends her apologies I phoned her asking her if her network is now ok & she said please ask if it is ok to continue tomorrow because she is the rural area & her ntwk gets worse during the evening bcz you have to move around in search of network which is very difficult so can you please reschedule for tomorrow
