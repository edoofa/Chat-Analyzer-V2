I learnt that Edoofa is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt ltd,, India. It believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of the elite. It solves both problems of lack of affordability and employability in higher education. It also aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities to mention a few.

I have a dream to further my education studies but I have a financial hump ahead. I believe if I am accepted into the Edoofa Program I will be able to fulfill my dreams and cross River Rubicon
