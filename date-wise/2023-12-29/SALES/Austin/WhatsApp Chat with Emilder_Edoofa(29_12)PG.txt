What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? You can get a 100% scholarship with Edoofa program but it does not cover all costs from transport to flight. There's an earn as you learn program that helps you get funds to pay for your fees and credits. This sponsorship program is based in India. For help I can contact Miss Jasmine or Miss Saloni.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I am a young, ambitious woman and full of potential. My passion is deeply grounded within the law sector and in the need to make the world a better place through finding justice for those that were wronged and make their life easier. My parents can't fund for my education, because they earn very little.
