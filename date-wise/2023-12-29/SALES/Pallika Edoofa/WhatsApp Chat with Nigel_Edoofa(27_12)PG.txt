28/12/23, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
28/12/23, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

28/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 967 5991: Yes I'm quite confident in achieving maximum points
28/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 967 5991: I have not done any research yet and haven't applied to any university abroad as Im still cautiously waiting for the results
28/12/23, 10:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thank you for this

28/12/23, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok studying in India will have a positive impact on my career because I will get to learn a lot not just that I will learn so much after coming from India. As prior based on my career I had quite seen many CEO in the India commercial sector who will be a great figure in my life as they will be my dream model or my dream people for example Mr Rajeev Suri as I had been a Nokia lover I think that will be a quite motivating for me towards the achievement of my career dream and I aim to achieve my career aspirations from India because I will be able to be taught numerous projects which enables me to acquire skills and practical experience whilst I'm learning .So the earn while you learn program is not just a simple program from my own opinion as it will help to upgrade students to better heights and also enhancing employability at the same time because those tasks also motivates one to work hard and do their best .
28/12/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nigel, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 967 5991: I guess we surely don't know that yet and please help me in knowing because I don't have any family member who had been an international student
28/12/23, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
28/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes I think its affordable
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
28/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 967 5991: OK like I gone throughout the document it mentioned that students are offered tasks or projects online by a company via edoofa which in return in one accomplishes the task they are compensated in form of scholarship credits but please add more help me understand more about how it is done
28/12/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel,  we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally


And after working on these projects you will be earning scholarship credits based on your performance.
28/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thank you so much I understand a lot better and its an exclusive and very  beneficiary for Edoofians a lot.
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me give you a detailed information too
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

28/12/23, 1:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
28/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thank alot
28/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 967 5991: That's impressive
28/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes I will really benefit a lot from this program and as  I will be job ready by the time I graduate which differentiates edoofians from other graduates or students
28/12/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thank you so much I understand it well and all I can say that its a good program an exclusive one
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch.
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
28/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok
28/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 967 5991: 4
28/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Higher education concierge
28/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

28/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
28/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thanks I'm eager to learn alot
28/12/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
28/12/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
28/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 967 5991: My father
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
28/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes I will be discussing everything with then after today's session
28/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Genuinely they feel fine with it
28/12/23, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
28/12/23, 3:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
28/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes  it is
28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 967 5991: That's impressive it will ndeed be great
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes please explain
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/12/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
28/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 967 5991: I understand this
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 967 5991: That's great so in phase 1 when does that process begin
28/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Ok
28/12/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 967 5991: I think we are at  stage 1
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes we also discussed stage 3 and 4
28/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's true!
28/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain the remaining steps
28/12/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
28/12/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
28/12/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
28/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Yes I understand it and its really clear the edoofa cycle
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 967 5991: Thank you for explaining well the cycle
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
