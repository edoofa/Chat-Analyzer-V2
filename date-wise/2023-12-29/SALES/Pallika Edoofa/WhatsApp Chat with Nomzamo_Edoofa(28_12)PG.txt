28/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I am Ngwenya Nomzamo , a student selected for the Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. Ofwhich it has been my dream to pursue  my studies  abroad due to the affordability  of fees and employment  opportunity as compared  to Zimbabwe where by the  colleges  and university  fees are expensive  as my parents  also struggled pay my school  fees during my days.And they can't  even raise that money for me to go and start my tertiary  education because  they are also paying for my younger brother  who is grade 6.

I attended  my Secondary  level at Bulu high where l found it enjoyable  to study fashion and fabrics thus where l gained more interest  to work as a fashion designer and also liked being a teacher because because  as a fashion designer  you can desion different  patterns   and sell,work as as a teacher  also l can open and operate my own company  maybe thus l will be aslo helping  my community by  exporting  some other clothes  to be sold  in my country  if its allowed.

Moreover ,since l had finished  my Secondary  level life has been stuck  since l have been applying  for other courses but not been shortlisted  for any.Therefore the fees now at colleges  rates to US $210per term which adds up to US $ 630 per year food exclusive, And to mention internet costs it adds up to $1000 per year.Therefore l find it better to study in India where by the fees are of less costs and has to access  to network the student's  education  is more  valuable. 

I completed  my A Level in 2019 where l did Geography,Economics and Business Studies,I would  like to do Teaching in Fashion and Designing.
My parents have  no professions as  my mother is just at home seated and my father does piece jobs in South Africa.My mother's  highest education  is form 3 in secondary level and my father in grade 7 in Primary level as  their parents  had no money  to pay for their fees.Yes l have got my sister who also do some piece jobs in South Africa to support   her 2 kids who are in Primary   level.Moreover my father is hs been so supportive  to me since l started my primary  as he has been doing  piece jobs to support  us.

It is my desire  to study abroad  and my sister is also willing and promising to be financially  supportive.Since my daddy in now at retirement  stage.And l also had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course,  which offer offers opportunity earnings  between $50 and $100.

Moreso,l attended  my O'Level and A'Level at Bulu High School   which is in Mangwe District  in Matebeleland South  province,thus where  my parents  paid a school fees which tated to US $190 per term to ensure  l had sufficient  internet
