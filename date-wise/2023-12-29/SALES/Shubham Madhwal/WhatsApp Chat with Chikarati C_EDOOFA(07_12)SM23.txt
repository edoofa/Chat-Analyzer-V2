Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I am a Christian , in denomination seventh day Adventist.I was born in a family of three and I'm the first born. My siblings are currently doing their primary school at a local school called Saint Paul's Gokwe primary school. My father is a rehabilitation Technician at Gokwe District Hospital where we stay .He obtained a diploma as highest form if education. My mother has just finished her Nursing training and is awaiting results. My parents have been paying for my school fees from primary to Ordinary level and now advanced level but to study abroad there can be slight problems since their earnings cannot support all our fees. To study abroad I seek  financial aid so as to pursue my courses abroad . I would like to study abroad because I seek higher quality education for my course doing medicine . I personally think myself as an A student Wich is evidenced by 9 straight A in ordinary level at Lower Gwelo Adventist high school including A's in science subjects Maths and chemistry and 4 B's. I also have a higher education examination council Distinction in computer operations and packages and credit in information, communication and Technology. I am awaiting my A level results wich I wish to score a maximum of 20 points in Pure mathematics, Physics, chemistry and statistics and a minimum of 16 points.And abroad I would like to take a course in medicinal sciences in order to pursue my dream carrier of being a medical doctor with your aid I may advance even further and further in improving and saving lives . In short that's all I can say about myself and I thank you for even trying me to indulge in this Edoofa program . My wish is to be part of the study abroad scholarship program with a 100% scholarship if I deserve and if it is the will of God .
09/12/23, 1:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
09/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 291 7701: As I already highlighted I was studying at Lower Gwelo Adventist High school. It is an seventh day Adventist church institution , a mission church sited in Gweru Midlands province

The school is an internationally accredited school with an A as of this year ..it provides high quality education. It also enhanced my physical growth as we used to work in fields with regular work programs , this helped me to learn to farm, woodwork , clean and much more . We also had a gym at school where we kept our physical bodies healthy

It also touched the spiritual aspect because we had morning prayers everyday and regular meetings in church to learn about God and how to mold our characters to be good students qualified for heaven. I participated in church programs and was appointed a pathfinder counselor.

Mentally I participated in quiz activities ...Aids quiz we reached district level as a team and this aided in sharpening my mind ...I also participated in bible quiz at church.. we also went for school quiz and I represented my school as best in chemistry till district level .. I am also a chess Wizard with an unbeaten streak record at this school 

I was part of three clubs at the schools namely Young farmer's club Wich we learnt of new ways of crop cultivation and animal husbandry and First aid club Wich taught me much about caring for others and procedures when someone is injured 
And finally with computer club we spread computer literacy in surrounding schools

And most importantly I was the school senior prefect Wich taught me how to enforce the rules and I made very good lasting relationship with many teachers at this school


I am very proud to say I had the best high school experience at this schools and enhanced my growth , physically, mentally, morally and spiritually
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
09/12/23, 2:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Medical science, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
09/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Well since childhood I grew up at a health institution from one General hospital to the other .... So I grew up idolizing doctors and health personals wanting to be like them when I grow up ...and now I'm grown I've realized that my dream has become my passion.... I love helping others and I feel like it's my calling... At school I was the captain of the First aid club ... At school I love chemistry thats my favorite subject thus people encouraged me to do medical sciences
Whenever someone fell sick at school they came to me for medication and I ended up with a nickname Dr chiks ... surrounding influences always say you will be a great doctor ...and since I personally love that job the words are  motivation to me 

I want to help in someone's recovery ...I do my best to make sure someone is well ...maybe it all started when I was young when I faced the trauma when my cousin brother had a seizure and I cried feeling helpless and couldn't do anything..he was later saved by a doctor..thus I devoted my work to saving lives 

The subject I do at A level if I pass will lead me to my future path of being a doctor.

14/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Well I loved both physics and biology almost equally the same and at O level I had a B in both subject but due to the circumstances at our school you had to choose one between physics and biology...so I opted for physics since it has a wide range of job applications and my strength is in calculations..
14/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 291 7701: I also heard that with physics you can still venture into the field of medicine...
14/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 291 7701: After my O level results it was a hard choice between physics and biology but I made the tough choice ...taking physics
14/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Chikarati, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
14/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 291 7701: No,  not yet
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
14/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Thank you for shedding light ....so seems like I don't qualify for medicine in India
14/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 335 8337: Yes go ahead

18/12/23, 1:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
18/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 335 8337: Hardworking is part and parcel of my values ...I'm prepared to take all and leave nothing
18/12/23, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
18/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 335 8337: I'm so confident that will achieve 3 A level Passes

20/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 335 8337: Yes
20/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 335 8337: Afternoon...I currently don't have any knowledge about the cost of education in India
20/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
20/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
20/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

20/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 335 8337: Waaal that so interesting....also wish to part and parcel of the program
20/12/23, 5:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
