11/12/23, 8:09 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
11/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay sir, l will be available and thank you for your patience really appreciate
12/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes sir
12/12/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 372 3003: I'm free now
12/12/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 372 3003: I have learnt a lot from Munashe, firstly considering our my background here in Zimbabwe l have noticed that getting a scholarship at your institution will be a great opportunity for me as they offer quality education. Not only do you offer quality education but quality life skills. It has always been my passion to know more or study different cultures" diversity" and with the help of Edoofa l can aquire some of those skills
12/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 372 3003: According to my research l also came across this program where one has to earn money while learning which is also good for us as students because we don't just have to learn theory without applying it to practical like what most universities in Zimbabwe are doing. So it is what also differs Edoofa from other institutions as it teaches us theory and also teach is to apply what we learn into practice
12/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 372 3003: Sorry about late replies l'm having network problems but lm trying my best to get in touch
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Ndhlovu! It's fantastic to hear about your interest in Edoofa. The opportunity to receive quality education coupled with life skills is indeed a standout feature of the institution. Your passion for understanding different cultures and diversity aligns perfectly with what Edoofa offers, creating a space where you can acquire these invaluable skills.
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me give you a brief about the program myself.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 372 3003: Exactly, l want to help reduce the burden of my parents
12/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it will be a great opportunity for me if l get this scholarship as it will help me gain quality skills and education as well as helping my parents reduce their financial burden
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Ndhlovu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now Prosper, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 372 3003: My name is Njabulo Prosper Ndhlovu, a boy aged 19 residing in Amaveni a high density area in the city of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.
•) Currently l am waiting for my A'level results as l aspire to be an electrical or mechanical engineer. •)My dad is a truck driver and my mother a teacher and still not employed which,  makes it difficult for both l and my siblings to acquire quality education because my father is the only one working yet earning peanuts, and l believe that he is the one who will be supporting me with my education abroad.
 •)Since nursery up to now my parents are the ones that have been supportinge with my education.
•) My mom and dad managed to acquire their O'level certificates as their highest level of education.
•) l have two siblings a boy and a girl, the boy doing her high school level that is form 2 next year and the girl doing her primary level that is  grade 7 next year.
•) Currently l was studying at Kwekwe high school located in Midlands, and fees was $150 per -term.
In an addition l would like to say that my parents have always taught me that education is the key to success and their teachings are the one's that are driving me to acquire what l want to be in life.
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful addition, Prosper! The guidance and teachings of parents about the significance of education as a pathway to success are incredibly valuable. Their wisdom and support serve as a guiding force, motivating you to pursue your aspirations and work towards your goals in life.
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 372 3003: On that note l would like to share my deputy head's contact number because he's the one who was always available at school.

Name of deputy Head:  Mr D takawira.

12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study electrical or mechanical engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Because since childhood it has always been my passion to design and construct models of machines and especially with the combination l was doing in Physics we would always design and construct models of certain machines. Also when there is a problem with household circuits be it lighting systems etc l fix the problem and because of this l have gained passion in wanting to be in these fields rather than medicine
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Prosper, your passion for electrical and mechanical engineering since childhood is truly inspiring! It's fantastic that from a young age, you were drawn to designing and constructing machine models, showing a natural inclination toward understanding how things work and are built. The combination of designing models in physics further fueled your interest in these fields, highlighting your knack for hands-on problem-solving and creativity.
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: My uncle who's a mechanical engineer
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: And he's also the one who is inspiring me
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay
12/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Is it possible for me to send tomorrow or night after l have arranged for my report card
12/12/23, 6:15 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Thank you and same to you sir
13/12/23, 7:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 372 3003: Good morning how are you!
13/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 460 8240: Good morning everyone l'm Prosper Ndhlovu's mother
13/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 372 3003: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
13/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay do you mind explaining further why  think that it will cater my likings
13/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.
13/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
13/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay so do these types of engineering mentioned above fall under Bachelor of Technology Mechanical engineering for example mechatronics. All B.tech mechanical engineering specialise with automotive only?
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Indeed, the Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering encompasses various specializations and sub-disciplines within the broader field of mechanical engineering. Here's a breakdown:

Mechanics: This covers the study of forces, deformation, and materials. It includes statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, fluid mechanics, and kinematics.

Mechatronics and Robotics: Mechatronics integrates mechanics, electronics, and software engineering to create hybrid systems. Robotics is an application of mechatronics where robots are designed and used for various tasks.

Thermodynamics and Thermo-science: This branch deals with energy transformation in systems, such as automotive engines converting fuel into heat and mechanical work.

Design and Drafting: This involves technical drawing and design, crucial for creating products and manufacturing instructions. It includes traditional drafting techniques and modern computer-aided design (CAD).

Regarding your query about automotive specialization, Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering doesn't exclusively specialize in automotive engineering. It covers a wide array of disciplines as mentioned earlier, including automotive engineering but not limited to it. Students pursuing this degree can choose various paths based on their interests, be it production engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, and more.

So, mechatronics, for instance, is a specialized sub-discipline falling under mechanical engineering, and while automotive engineering is a part of mechanical engineering, the degree isn’t solely centered on automotive studies. There's a diverse range of opportunities and specialties available within a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering beyond automotive engineering.
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay thankyou, l interested with the course
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 372 3003: l am*
13/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
13/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah from what l understood, l think you said that l can also partake in fields like mechatronics, mechanics, thermodynamics and thermo science etc with a degree in B. Tech mechanical engineering as there are more specialties and opportunities within the course. That is if lm not mistaken
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This would be a great opportunity for me if l am to provided this career because, like l said it has been my dream since childhood to become a mechanical engineer. Taking your question into account in 5 years time l am seeing myself having my own company of engineering because l like it when l am my own boss and it also gives me an opportunity to help other people who will be in need. It has been my passion too to start a multi organisation institution which helps those in need be it job opportunities, clothes, food etc and to achieve this l would need your institution Edoofa to help because not only do you help us gain quality education but also principles which makes us human beings in the society. I have researched a lot about Edoofa and also followed some of the Edoofans and by doing so l gained a lot interest with Edoofa because l have seen that there are more qualities which l can learn from you, like teamwork, communication skills through interactions, critical thinking which will help me in future as l would be my own boss. So there is a lot to learn from Edoofa which l can use to achieve my dreams and that is why l found it necessary to apply and work with Edoofa.
13/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Prosper I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I am willing to,even to give more that 200%
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 372 3003: more than*
13/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 372 3003: 1)l have many reasons for instance our economy  in Zimbabwe is not stable and due to this there is an increase in fees which makes it difficult for us as students to accomplish our dreams because there is no employment.But taking India into consideration for example with the help of Edoofa l can earn money while learning and this will reduce the burden of my parents because l will be able to meet some of my expenses alone, while they "my parents" will be striving to give my siblings better education with me also helping where necessary. 
2) In this world we are living in technology is now taking over and my country Zimbabwe is behind interms of technology which makes it difficult for us as students to achieve most of our dreams, but taking India into consideration according to my research it's one of the best country interms of being advanced when it comes to technology and that is wy l also applied to Edoofa because this will help me achieve my dreams.
3) Due to rise in inflation in Zimbabwe data prices are increasing daily and assignments need a lot of data so if l have the opportunity to study abroad "India" it would reduce the burden because data prices are affordable compared to Zimbabwe.
4)Like John B. Ervin, l believe in the importance of gaining a good education, and l also share his 
passion in engaging my community and helping to bring diverse people together. I am interested in learning different cultures hence studying abroad in countries like India, especially at your institutions where many students all over countries gather, l will be able to explore all the cultures hence become better interms of associating and communicating with different races.
13/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay l think l said it before that l would like to start multi organisation which be based in my home country where l will be  also helping all students with scholarships and at my institution l will be able to contribute all that l would have learnt abroad hence by that these teachings will spread in the country hence improvement of education system in Zimbabwe
13/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 372 3003: It will be like a hierarchy where what l would have learnt, will also be taught to the students at this institution and the students will also accomplish their goes and teach the teachings to other people hence the teachings will spread easily.
13/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Prosper, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I agree
13/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I agree and that's why l need you as Edoofa to counsel and guide me on the right path
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it's true
13/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
13/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

13/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now Prosper, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I understood everything
13/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 372 3003: All my questions are answered, l guess.
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
13/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 372 3003: No
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This is fair
13/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Prosper what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
13/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yes
13/12/23, 7:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay same to you sir
13/12/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This is nice🫶🏽
14/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes sir, and good morning
14/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
14/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes l'm ready
14/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Prosper, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 372 3003: It is a good program indeed
14/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
14/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
14/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

14/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 372 3003: I think that this is good program which can help change our lives as Edoofians. Definitely this will benefit me.
14/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Prosper, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 372 3003: I don't have a problem with that because generally l am a hardworker, when l commit myself to doing something l make sure that l achieve it.
14/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
14/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

14/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: Alright Prosper, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
14/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely
14/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
14/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes l have and my mom is also in this group
14/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 372 3003: My dad's number is0784529873 please add him in the group.
14/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 372 3003: I have discussed it with them.
14/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Noted, I have sent him the invitation link, please ask him to join.
14/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay thankyou
14/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes l am
14/12/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Prosper as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 372 3003: They'll end up spending $1500-$2250
14/12/23, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Prosper, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay sir
14/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah that makes sense
14/12/23, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Prosper basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
14/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay
14/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 372 3003: So how many points are required for one to earn the scholarship.
14/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
14/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

14/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 372 3003: +263 78 452 9873
14/12/23, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: Prosper, Like I just told you, if your are found eligible for the program, only then you have to pay $350, but we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: I have sent him the link again.
14/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay sir understood.
14/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay thankyou
14/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder added +263 78 452 9873
14/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
14/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 372 3003: No please enlighten me.
14/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright Prosper, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
14/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes
14/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
14/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
14/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
14/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 372 3003: For now l don't have questions
14/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING

Write a short essay in about 500 words 

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

Life in Rwanda has been of great difficult as women in Rwanda suffered and are still suffering the consequences of the crisis and many of them left to face tremendous responsibilities of reconstruction and also added responsibilities as many of them are either widowed or have their husbands in jail hence finding themselves heads of households.

The genocide in 1994 however in which a greater number of people were murdered in one of the starkest examples of government sponsored ethnic cleansing of the twentieth century makes Rwanda's history a cruelly unique one. Sixteen years after the event, Rwanda is widely viewed as a society that has managed remarkably well in a post-conflict context. The role of gender, education, wealth and location is an overview of poverty and inequality in Rwanda. Rwanda is also one of the poorest countries in the world, and also one of the most unequal. Due these high levels of poverty and inequality it has led to important implications not only in terms of evaluations of social welfare, but also for management of social tensions and the propensity of violent conflict in the future.

There is also a great effect on heath of people and this was according to examination to the community-based health insurance scheme that was implemented in Rwanda after the genocide called Mutuelle de Santa. The aim of this is to provide a better understanding in ways in which the provision of health services can be socially inclusive and provide access for health to those who need it. Employing logistic regression techniques, l find systematically lower membership for female- headed households. I also find female- headed households just as likely to access health care and to report worse general health status compared to their male counterparts.

Due to larger numbers of women, women are employed at a greater number than men. Due to this women employed, but whose husbands are not experience more sexual violence. I interpret this finding as reflecting male backlash, as men react to losing power in a context where gender norms have been destabilised.

SECTION 6
PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"
As for my inspiration my parents are my source of inspiration and l am greatful that they brought me into this world. One of the most hardest things l had to accept growing up was that l could not have everything l wanted because my parents showed me how exactly things work in life.

 Though my parents spoiled me at times l had to learn the importance of being unselfish because of having siblings. l had to learn the importance of sharing and also caring as the bigger brother. My parents are my source of inspiration because they showed me all aspects of life and how to live them through their experiences like work, education and parenting in addition.

 Their education life inspire me the most as they did not finish college that is proceed to Advanced level, hence they were not able to obtain lucrative careers as other parents. If they had finished college l know that our life would have been more successful interms of finance. No matter the hardships my parents managed to give us a better life that is send us to school my siblings and l. 

What inspires me the most is the way they thrive to make us people in future and because this it has been my aim to excell in my studies and achieve good grades inorder to repay them back with what they have done for me since childhood, and l also want to secure a good future for my kids when l am older so that they will not have a life like the one l had during my childhood.

 I thank my parents for always being there for me because no matter the circumstances they always worked hard to ensure that my siblings and l get what we want in life though not that much financially stable as a family. They also taught me the importance of education as they always say education is the key to success and taking this into consideration l am where l am today because of their wise words and upbringing.

26/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 372 3003: As per my understanding l understood that we are supposed to deposit the fee before the 29th of December and failure to do so will result in the acceptance letter being invalid. So l believe that will pay the money before due date.
26/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 460 8240: Yes we are
26/12/23, 11:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
26/12/23, 11:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
26/12/23, 11:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
26/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay sir noted
26/12/23, 11:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
26/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 372 3003: For now l don't everything is understandable
26/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263784529873  @263774608240, Prosper 's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 29th of December, 2023, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
26/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 460 8240: So you mean that apart from $350 fee payment there is also 12.5% to be paid by us parents
26/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please. If you pay via international transaction. Ie mode 1 that will cost you around $80-$100
26/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Whereas in the second method the transaction fees with the 12.5% is around half of the above mentioned amount. As it will be around $44.5
26/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 460 8240: Umm l'm now confused about these transaction fees why do they differ lve never heard of such things when dealing with banks
26/12/23, 12:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please can you elaborate?
26/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: They defer
Because if you would have gone through acceptance letter you would have noticed
That the first mode of transfer is an international transaction method and second mode was a local transfer hence there is a charge difference
26/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 460 8240: Okay now that l'm in Zim l suppose to you the international account and it will cost me about $80-$100
26/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 460 8240: Now l've understood everything Sir l have contacted Mr Shorwi he explained everything to me therefore l will make my payment of $200 on 28of December. Thank you
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
26/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 460 8240: I also like to understand the issue of the percentage of scholarship. I understand that my son was rewarded 60-100% of scholarship according to marks he got from the tests given to him. So now what l want know is for him to get 100% will it be determined by the results of A-level or something else
26/12/23, 1:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263774608240 As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Prosper was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1600-$2300), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
26/12/23, 1:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Prosper 's potential. I firmly believe that if students like him are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
26/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 460 8240: Thank you
26/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
