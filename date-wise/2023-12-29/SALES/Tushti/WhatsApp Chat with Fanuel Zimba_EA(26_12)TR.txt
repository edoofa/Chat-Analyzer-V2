28/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 830 3300: Anything you need?
28/12/23, 12:30 pm - Tushti: Yes
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - Tushti: I would like for you to help me understand how the family would manage the finances involved in Fanuel's higher education abroad, seeing as you have to cater to the needs of three younger children
28/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 830 3300: It's depends on what is charged.  I thought he said it's a scholarship
28/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: @263778303300 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 499 8797: So in other terms, my family has to pay for me to go and study abroad
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - Tushti: That is correct
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 499 8797: ,l thought this was all sponsored in every aspect
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - Tushti: No, dear
28/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 499 8797: ,so this isn't sponsored in any way?
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: No, this is a scholarship, not a sponsorship
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 499 8797: ,so then since l will be paying for my tuition. What's the point, of this whole programme?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 499 8797: What is your purpose in all this...
28/12/23, 3:57 pm - Tushti: The scholarship reduces the fee amount significantly
28/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 499 8797: ,by how many percent
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: The scholarship could be anywhere from 50-100%, depending on your scores and performance
28/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 499 8797: ,ok so if l get 13 out 15 points, you reduce by how many percent
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
