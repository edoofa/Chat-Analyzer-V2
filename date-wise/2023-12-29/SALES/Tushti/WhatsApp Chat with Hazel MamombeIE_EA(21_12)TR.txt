I was in the commercial section doing Pure mathematics, Accounts and Business studies. I would like to pursue the course of Accounting because l have always been passionate about accounts. I have two brothers who are both older than me, the first born works at Pick n Pay and the other one in Bulawayo as a bank teller.Iam a very hardworking person who is also good at team work. Also, l interact well with others. However, l tend to have huge trust issues with people.On my free time l usually watch television.
 
My school fees per term rounded to $170 and my father has been responsible for the bills. He will also be supporting me financially for my further education currently, my father is self employed as a small scale farmer and my mother is also self employed as a tailor. They both did their ordinary levels and both went to college. <This message was edited>

22/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 254 1610: Thanks for the platform. Firstly we need to know how the funders operate.

22/12/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: The cost of education abroad can be around $7000 per year, which Edoofa can help bring down to about $2000 per year. Would that be affordable for the family?
22/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 254 1610: Under our current circumstances, these fees are not tenable for us
22/12/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: I see

23/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 254 1610: Hazel your platform
23/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 254 1610: Nice
23/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
23/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 289 2944: If given the opportunity to pursue a career in B-Com, l envision myself five years down the line as a seasoned professional. I see myself as an independent, financially secure individual who is able to provide for my family and myself. The Edoofa program will enable me to achieve this by providing me with the skills, knowledge and connections l need to succeed in my career. I believe that with hard work and dedication, l can use my B-Com degree to achieve my goals and make a positive impact on my community.
With my B-Com degree, l hope to gain the knowledge and experience needed to find a well paying job in the financial sector and eventually work my way up the corporate ladder. I believe that with the Edoofa program's focus on career-ready skills and networking opportunities, l will be able to achieve my goals and build a successful future for my family and myself.
By giving back to my community, l hope to make a positive impact and inspire others to pursue their goals and dreams.

23/12/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: That is really great Hazel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
23/12/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: Noted
23/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 289 2944: Thank you for your words of encouragement. I know that pursuing a career in finance will be challenging, but lm ready to put in the hard work  and dedication needed to succeed .
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 289 2944: I think studying abroad is a far more better choice because it will give me access to better educational facilities and opportunities and to add to that it can open new horizons by meeting different people. I would also like to study abroad because l get to experience different culture setups through a global perspective.
23/12/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: I see
23/12/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

26/12/23, 11:02 am - Tushti: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 11:02 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
26/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 289 2944: Yess lam aware
26/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: Do tell me what the cost is, according to you?
26/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 289 2944: $7000-$8000
26/12/23, 11:17 am - Tushti: Very well
26/12/23, 11:17 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 11:17 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 11:17 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: In simple wordswhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 289 2944: That is really wonderful
26/12/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: What is your parent's opinion on the costs?
26/12/23, 5:39 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:22 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
