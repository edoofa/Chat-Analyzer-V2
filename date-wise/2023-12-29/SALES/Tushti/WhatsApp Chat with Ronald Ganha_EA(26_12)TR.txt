28/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
28/12/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Is this clear?
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 720 8354: Yes.

28/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
28/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 720 8354: Okay
28/12/23, 1:19 pm - Tushti: Will your U6 results be better?
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 720 8354: Is the scholarship only for the tuition fee or it also covers the accommodation.
28/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 720 8354: Yes I'm sure that they will be better.
