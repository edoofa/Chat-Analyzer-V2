I want to be accepted into the Edoofa Program because that I have passed my Alevel so I want to go to University to learn on Business management but the problem in hand is my parents do not have enough money for me to go to University they are all unemployed

22/12/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
