27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Kudzaiishe!

I wanted to express my disappointment upon realizing that my last message went unanswered, specifically the question I posed at the end.

I provided you with a holiday to facilitate a focused and stress-free environment for your exams. However, I can't help but feel disheartened that a simple question seems to have been overlooked. I understand the demands of this period, but a basic acknowledgment or response would have sufficed.

It's a small but important detail that will contribute to your success. Is this not important to you?
27/12/23, 4:25 PM - +91 73036 42433: My apologies ma’am, I hadn’t realized 

My journey so far has been full of spins and turns, discovering quite a lot, learning, observing and many other sorts.

Ultimately its been a life changing experience and I’m still learning and in the process of change.  

With regards to the grant, I’m still looking for students, i invite a lot of people through various platforms, Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, WhatsApp
28/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Kudzaiishe!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.

Thank you very much
