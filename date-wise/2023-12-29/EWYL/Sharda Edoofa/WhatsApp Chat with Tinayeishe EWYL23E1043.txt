As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
28/12/23, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Is that clear, Tinayeishe?
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am thank you so in nk longer going to do what you have tasked me to do about the project 1

28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING*
Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Tinayeishe!
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
28/12/23, 9:44 AM - +263 78 790 1774: I have understood that the community building helps students to collaborate with communities and the goal is to  forster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction. The primary idea is to make students develop in network working, communication skills etc. And help other African to joic Edoofa systems. It also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them to help life of others.

28/12/23, 10:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Do you want me to reshare the audio?

28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Tinayeishe, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
