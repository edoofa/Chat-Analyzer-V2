26/12/23, 1:36 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon Comedy*
I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 3:01 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the scheduled session time is over, we are wrapping up our session today.
26/12/23, 3:01 PM - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to know the reason behind your absence.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Sharda Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon Comedy*
As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀

In these powerful words, Pichai unveils the magic of embracing challenges. Failures aren't roadblocks but rather detours leading to invaluable lessons and remarkable achievements. 🌟

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!
27/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 138 8046: Good afternoon Ma'am

*PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING*
Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it.
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.

I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 71 138 8046: I'm good maam
