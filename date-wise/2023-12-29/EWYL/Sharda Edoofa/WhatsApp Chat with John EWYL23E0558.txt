I hope you are doing well

Since we could not have our session on Monday due to Christmas holiday, *I would like to reschedule our session today at 9:30 am today.* I would like to ensure that you do not miss out on any learning opportunity along with the ongoing festive fun. 

Kindly come to the EWYL Line at 9:30 am confirming you are ready for the session.

I could not attend because I was offline for that matter. I’ve been answering questions and trying to figure out a lot about the EWYL Program but I’ve not been given any feed back about my university stay.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon! It sounds like you've been actively engaged in answering questions and exploring the EWYL Program. I understand it can feel bad not to receive feedback on your university stay. It is helpful to reach out directly to the admission officers to inquire about the status.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 771923158: Okay thanks you very much let me do so
27/12/23, 3:35 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay John. You are welcome please.
28/12/23, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day!
Kindly come to the EWYL Line since you have a session scheduled there from 9:30am. I am waiting for your message.
