I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My Christmas was very fine. We visited my grandmother at Mberengwa here in Zimbabwe. We had so much funny😁

How was your Christmas?
26/12/23, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you had a delightful Christmas visiting your grandmother in Mberengwa! Family gatherings are always special. As for me, I too had a great time at our family lunch where all of us gathered. How did you find spending time with your family during the festive season? Is there anything specific you'd like to share or discuss? 😊🎄
26/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My grandmother works at Msume high school here in Mberengwa so yesterday we went to her working place to do some cleanings.  There is a distance  from her house to the working place. We then returned home , bathed and cooked food. Food is my thing😅😅.This Christmas was very different  because there was no fruits to eat such as mangoes. This was due to climate change which caused the temperatures to be high and no rainfall. Believe me, l was very bored 😩because l like mangoes.
26/12/23, 8:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It's wonderful that you spent time with your grandmother and contributed to the community by helping with cleanings at Msume High School. It's also understandable how the absence of fruits, like mangoes, due to climate change could affect the usual Christmas experience. Changes in climate can indeed have various impacts on the environment and traditions. Despite the differences, it's clear that your focus on family, helping out, and enjoying good food made the day special in its own way.
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Yes😅
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: I like eating

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.

There is a great opportunity to connect with technological driven and digital companies. So u start  by identifying these Companies in your area or country then share your objectives with your friends, family or parents who work in that sector. Furthermore you create a LinkedIn account that will allow you to search for companies and  connect with employees.  Through LinkedIn you can reach to managers

28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 10:48 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Oky
28/12/23, 10:53 AM - +263 77 955 1065: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 11:00 AM - +263 77 955 1065: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Firstly l will have to create a whatsapp group then identity the right students who can be part of our group.The goal is to reach out for more students and provide them with important information about Edoofa before the counseling section.  For this to be simple, l will have to get in touch with my school mates.
The main reason of creating a group and provide the link for my group is to reach out to more audience using less energy and also saving time. I will be sharing the information about the exciting opportunity to pursue education in India . I will then add you as the mentor so as to provide guidance and skills, this will help because you will be ensuring that the right information is spared amongst students
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - Sharda Edoofa: - Well Done Pride, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Oky noted
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
