27/12/23, 4:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Marvellous,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - +91 92892 39087: No ma’am it’s not that the grant is not that much important for me but instead am trying, for I send each n every form I get. Hence am still working on it
28/12/23, 9:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Marvellous,
How are you?
28/12/23, 9:44 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I recognize that you are working towards it but you neither shared any challenges that you are facing nor any progress that you made. May I know your thoughts on this?
