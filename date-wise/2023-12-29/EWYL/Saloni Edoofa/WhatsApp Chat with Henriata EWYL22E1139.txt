How are you?

I am sure you are very excited about today's session🫶🏻
27/12/23, 10:04 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Yes l am ......we may begin the session
27/12/23, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have understood till here?
27/12/23, 10:07 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Yes ma'am l did
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Henriata/Saloni/27DEC2023*
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/12/23, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/12/23, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/12/23, 10:53 AM - +263 77 269 9037: Good morning. I'm sorry to inform you that Henriata'"s phone has run out of battery and there is no electricity to recharge the battery
27/12/23, 10:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Oh no worries, I can understand that.
27/12/23, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
28/12/23, 9:59 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Good morning ma'am ........lm very sorry for yesterday's incident my phone ran out of battery all of a sudden .....once again am sory
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - +263 71 563 0656: I have already formed a group Ma'am
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - +263 71 563 0656: The students are now asking about the application forms they filled in
28/12/23, 10:06 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Henriata,

28/12/23, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Great Henriata! <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

28/12/23, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

28/12/23, 10:45 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Okay ma'am noted
28/12/23, 10:46 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think.
