How are you?

26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I have asked
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Justine,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:45 PM - +91 73473 53880: Good evening ma'am 
There isn't any misunderstanding on your part and the grant is more than I could've asked for
28/12/23, 9:51 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Justine,
How are you?
28/12/23, 9:52 AM - +263 78 073 6090: Good afternoon ma'am 
I'm doing well
28/12/23, 9:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: But I hope you can remember that only a grant will not help you in the long term, I will be sad to see students like you who have so much potential have limited themselves just to that amount.
28/12/23, 9:54 AM - +263 78 073 6090: Apart from the grant and scholarship credits is there more to it ma'am
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - +263 78 073 6090: The credits you say ?
Yes I understand I need to work hard and increase my grants
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - +263 78 073 6090: My scholarship credits I mean ***
28/12/23, 11:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, but in the past few months, you performance in projects has been below the average bar. May I know the challenges?
28/12/23, 5:11 PM - +91 73473 53880: I can't say  l have been facing any challenges.  I do reach out to my friends, students who wrote their exams this year at my school 
So I'm not sure if I amnthe one failing to convince them or they don't really want
