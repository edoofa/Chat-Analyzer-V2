28/12/23, 8:07 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Tapiwa,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
