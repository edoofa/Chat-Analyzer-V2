23/12/23, 4:31 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Nyasha,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?

28/12/23, 9:05 AM - +91 73034 51843: Yes I denied because I do not have any grant 
You just woke up and say you grant have been revoked but as my mentor you know fully well why performance was not satisfactory.

I openly told you that ma'am I am having issues with my phone its not connecting to other platforms.

Moving on Ms Saloni you did not even consider that


The other thing you have been addressing the new 300 plan to us your students so that we can work on them and that's good

But ma'am to be honest and frank enough with you,if you were in my shoes are you going to put effort with the current situation

What I mean is in the past when we were still in Zimbabwe !I worked on these projects and managed to bring forms to you maam and these students did all the procedures and they are even here in India and I did not get any money as promised

So if you are in my shoes are you going to continue doing these projects when you are not even honoured a bit but what you can tell me is that am not eligible for tge grant
28/12/23, 9:06 AM - +91 73034 51843: It is is you who made me lose trust and effort because you did not consider my efforts and situation
28/12/23, 9:07 AM - +91 73034 51843: Maam I know but the question is do I have a grant when am asked to provide a certificate of one
28/12/23, 9:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Nyasha, well it seems we have a lot to add to our discussion, and in chat it might seem like an endless conversation. I would request you if we can discuss the same over a call today if you are available?
28/12/23, 11:08 AM - Saloni Edoofa: If your phone is not functioning well, shall I connect with you through Brooke's device?
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - +267 77 814 654: Hello Ms Saloni.
Connect her through Natasha's fone
