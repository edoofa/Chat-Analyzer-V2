23/12/23, 4:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Edgar,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
