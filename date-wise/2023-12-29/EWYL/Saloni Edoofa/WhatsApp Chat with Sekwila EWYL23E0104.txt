27/12/23, 4:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Sekwila,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?

28/12/23, 4:02 PM - +260 96 6787650: Hi Saloni, hope you are well. I didn't realize that the grant comes this such conditions. Nevertheless we have engaging people here in Zambia and the biggest challenge we are facing is that people are hesitant to commit themselves because the kwacha has depreciated very much and others are saying they would rather wait for results before making any decisions. I hope this explanation helps. Regards
