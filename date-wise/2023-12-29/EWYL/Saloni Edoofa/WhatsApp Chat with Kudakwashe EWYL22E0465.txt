23/12/23, 4:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Kudakwashe,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:13 PM - +91 86990 97287: There is no problem mam
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +91 86990 97287: Obviously mam im trying my best to get all around many places searching for students like yesterday i talked to one of the headmasters in Mvuma and he's now talking to students about this program and i also provide a group link for interested students.
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Kudakwashe,
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Kudakwashe, and I am happy to hear that. 
You know what, I have even nominated for some activities for the industrial visit that is going to happen soon seeing that you are so positively charged but at times when I see you not responding or sharing such updates with me from your end only, then I feel a bit taken a back.
28/12/23, 8:57 AM - +91 86990 97287: Okok im sorry mam on that
28/12/23, 3:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +91 86990 97287: Yes mam i also have that in my mind, so i will try by all means to do all my projects, attending all my work or tasks so as to finance my self and maintain my name at the that level
