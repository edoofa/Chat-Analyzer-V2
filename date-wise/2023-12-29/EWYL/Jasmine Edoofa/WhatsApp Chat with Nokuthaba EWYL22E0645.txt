28/12/23, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Nokuthaba,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?

Please don't worry,I'm still working on my projects..
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear, I was waiting for you to acknowledge my above messages about Christmas.
28/12/23, 4:38 PM - +91 76961 31143: Ohh..I didn't celebrate the Christmas this year..I had an exam..
28/12/23, 8:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I can understand dear but at least you could have wished me. 
Nonetheless, I am happy that you are doing good. 
Goodnight Nokuthaba
