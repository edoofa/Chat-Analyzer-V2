I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 4:20 PM - +91 93118 52843: The grant is of great significance to me and l also thrive to make the milestone worthwhile and believe me l am trying my best on the projects.

Your commitment to making the most of this opportunity is commendable. I want to assure you that I am here to support and guide you as you work on your projects. Keep up the excellent effort, and I believe your hard work will make the milestone truly worthwhile.
28/12/23, 8:41 PM - +91 93118 52843: Yes mam , l feel important and much encouraged by your words.Thank you a lot.
