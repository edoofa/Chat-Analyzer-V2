28/12/23, 2:50 PM - +260 761919720: Create a WhatsApp group and identify the best students for the program, prepare them for Edoofa enrolment.
Advertise to people through their unofficial group that are in sixth form.
Show people the opportunity to get a scholarship to India
28/12/23, 3:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Mwenya, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 3:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
