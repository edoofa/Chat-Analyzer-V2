I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - +260 97 2378942: I’m so  sorry, I didn’t see the messages so I didn’t know that you sent a message before this. The grant is very significant to me and there are no misunderstandings.
28/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you for your message.
I am happy to know this, Edwin
28/12/23, 3:50 PM - +260 97 2378942: Thank you for bringing it up
28/12/23, 3:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's my pleasure
