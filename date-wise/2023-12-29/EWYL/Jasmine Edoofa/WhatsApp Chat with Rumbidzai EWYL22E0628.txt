28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 77 996 9746: I understood that I can get to chat with a lot of people who might be eligible for the program by creating a group a WhatsApp group ...I would have to add the program mentor inorder for her to oversee what would be happening in the group.the purpose is to reach a larger audience without using too much energy
28/12/23, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Rumbidzai, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 996 9746: Thank you
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 996 9746: Okay
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 77 996 9746: Will you give me some time though inorder to find people to add into the group because most of the people whom I talk with have their decisions on the university that they want
28/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
28/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it's time to wrap up the session. Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm

Make sure that you come to the session on your own and address your presence. 
Have a wonderful day ahead!
