28/12/23, 1:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Melani,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 1:17 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Hello mam
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - +27 74 745 8105: I am fine,yes mam the grant is very significant to me
28/12/23, 9:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Melanie, you have been missing all the sessions and calls. 
Can you please explain the reason of your absence and how is the grant significant to you.

28/12/23, 9:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I believe you have not attended a single session from this schedule, Melanie.
28/12/23, 9:38 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: What about this call
28/12/23, 9:40 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Am sorry mam
28/12/23, 9:41 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Is there any way l can cover up? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 9:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Make sure that you don't miss any session in future
28/12/23, 9:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Melanie, may I know that are you willing to work on the projects because seeing your absence I am getting an image that you don't care about the EWYL Program.
