So are you ready for today's session?
26/12/23, 11:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263737734295 Over the past few weeks, I've noticed that network challenges may be limiting your ability to participate in our sessions. However, for quite some time now, I've observed that our progress in these sessions has been stagnant due to your unavailability. Could you please clarify if there are any factors beyond network issues that are hindering your attendance in these sessions?
