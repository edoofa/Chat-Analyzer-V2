21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you're doing well today. Over the past few months, I've been attempting to connect with you, but it seems my efforts have been unsuccessful. I remember how enthusiastic you were about your higher education journey abroad during your enrollment and I am still here for you to make that dream come true.

By now, most of your peers have completed their admission processes, and I'd love for you to be on track with them. If you receive this message, could you please let me know your availability? I'd like to proceed with the admission process session and kick-start your admission before it is too late.
