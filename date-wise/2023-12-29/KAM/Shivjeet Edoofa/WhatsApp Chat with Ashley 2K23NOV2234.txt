I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
21/12/23, 6:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Ashley!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to get a response from your end the previous day. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir I am
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that we well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ummmm ,  I think for this one you may give me some time , so that I can talk to the school authority
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we can wait on the same. May I know by when you might be able to retrieve this form?
21/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am sure I'll talk to them on Monday
21/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait on the same.
