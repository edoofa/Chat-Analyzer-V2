28/12/23, 8:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: It's great to hear that. Also, It is important to note our operational hours, which are from *8:30 am to 4:30 pm as per Central African Time*. All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
28/12/23, 8:37 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes I did. So the sessions will be done everyday? From when to when?

28/12/23, 8:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about Dylan. Could you kindly provide an introduction of Dylan and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping Dylan's educational plans? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Dylan is a boy aged 18. He is a good boy and had a good behavior since his childhood even at school. Since his primary level I do not remember being called at school because Dylan has done cruel things no. He is eager to learn new things and likes correction. He is very sociable and kind. He is not hard to be friendly. At home he helps me with house chores and If I'm with him he helps me a lot. One of his teachers when he was transferring he felt bad because he was his best student. 

I am his mother aged 37. I have 2 children all boys.

His father is Sheperd Nyathi aged 39. He is an Artisan Rigger at Zimbabwe Power Company. He is pushing hard for his children to aim higher education. His father will play a role in shaping Dylan's educational plans. And I will also help him with the money I get from my businesses. I think this all I can say
28/12/23, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Mrs. Nyathi for providing inroduction about Dylan and your family. I truly appreciate it.
28/12/23, 9:11 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Thank you

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or Dylan won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes I did
28/12/23, 9:16 AM - +263 78 307 2351: As I said earlier Dylan will be back from rural areas to night. I called his grandfather he said Dylan's phone has no power.
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is well appreciated and we thank you for informing us!
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Welcome
