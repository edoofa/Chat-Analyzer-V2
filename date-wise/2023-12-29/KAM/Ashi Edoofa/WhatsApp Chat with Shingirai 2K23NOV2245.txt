It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

21/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Im following
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: 1)$1800
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: 2)3yrs
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: 3)$300
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 864 0240: 4)$750
21/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow me to correct you here please, As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
21/12/23, 3:19 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am.
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/12/23, 3:22 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am I have a question on this
21/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 77 864 0240: For instance if my parents can pay monthly is it allowed...
21/12/23, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 5:21 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Because in our country it might be a bit costly  to raise such amount at one time.
21/12/23, 5:22 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am..at the moment Shingirai ',s mobile network is not getting through.
21/12/23, 5:24 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Good afternoon Ma'am just happy to connect with you.Iam just following the conversation as well.
21/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @263717497818
21/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 77 864 0240: I'm sorry ma'am,I have been facing network challenges.
21/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 77 864 0240: I'm back .
21/12/23, 5:28 PM - +263 71 749 7818: On the accommodation issue,lam suggesting off campus since l will not be able to pay that sum of $2000 at once.l think monthly payments will be fair for me.
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263778640240, I am glad to see that you are back now.
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Hope you are getting me well.It will be nice of you to connect us with some of the Edofians who are having that kind of living.So that will have a glance of the off campus accommodation that basically suits us.
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts @263717497818, i will definitely assist you with the same.
21/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 71 749 7818: I will be grateful Ma'am thank you so much.
21/12/23, 5:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/12/23, 5:34 PM - +263 71 749 7818: It's clear Ma'am .
21/12/23, 5:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/12/23, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3rd, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am but the time frame is quite short ,can't we wait for other university admission approvals I think as time goes by I would have managed to raise the funds..
21/12/23, 5:43 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Universities.
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern @263717497818, Let me share the payment plan with you and I will assist you with your concern please.
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Okay Ma'am you may go ahead,lam listening.
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee.
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 71 749 7818: It's clear Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I glad to hear that @263717497818. With this payment plan. May I know if there is any concern you would like to share with us?
21/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 71 749 7818: It's fine Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Kwekwe,Zhombe District.
21/12/23, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 6:18 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Ohk Ma'am noted with thanks.
21/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am will see the alternative that l will use.
21/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Maaam won't I have some difficulties since may surname is incorrectly spelt
21/12/23, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, May I know what is the correction please?
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Noted with thanks Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Vunganai
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am could please connect me with other Edoofians.
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Who live outside the campus
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I will help you connect with other edoofians please don't worry.
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 71 749 7818: l have understood on that Ma'am.
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263717497818 May I know if we are still connected?
21/12/23, 7:45 PM - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 71 749 7818: It is clear Ma'am Ashi
21/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 71 749 7818: Yes we are still connected
21/12/23, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 71 749 7818: No queries as of now,thank you for all explanations.
21/12/23, 8:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263717497818. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
21/12/23, 8:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
