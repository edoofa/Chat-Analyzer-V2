21/12/23, 8:37 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Ben. Mbozi , Lilongwe, Malawi. The 650 one will do so that if fails we can do the other one. If you can do both the better as well
21/12/23, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999951305 I am not able to understand the amount here please
21/12/23, 8:38 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $325, or you can opt to pay the full $650 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/12/23, 8:39 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: 👆👆
21/12/23, 8:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright so you are planning to make the complete payment, right?
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Can you do both invoices if possible. So we pay the one which I or the banks will allow depending also on the forex availability
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999951305 In that case we will create two invoice of $325 each so that you have the option to make the payment accordingly. Is that okay?
21/12/23, 8:52 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: That will be good
21/12/23, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265999951305
21/12/23, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will do so please. Have a good night ahead!
26/12/23, 2:35 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to ask for feedback on the offer letter
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Freda, Wishing you a good day!
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me check with the team please
26/12/23, 2:57 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright thank you
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Good morning. I was trying to pay for the registration fee to the university unfortunately the bank says they do not know when they could remit the funds to your account due to forex issues. This being the deadline for registration what would be your advice
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: They've only said they prioritise medical treatment and next is education. Unless you give a longer extension considering also that School will open in September 24, it will be difficult this end
28/12/23, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Freda, I hope you are doing well. 

I understand your concern here, Usually the amount takes around  2-4 days to be transferred here. Due to the forex challenge, The banks give priority to education fees, since your registration fees is for your Higher Education, The bank will definitely help you here. May I know if you have mentioned the same to the bank?
