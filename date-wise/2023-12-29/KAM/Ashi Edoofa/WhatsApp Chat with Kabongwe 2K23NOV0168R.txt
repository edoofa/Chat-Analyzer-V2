27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 78 714 6734: What impressed me thus far, which i picked from the counselling session is the EWYL program. 
It gives an opportunity to cut financial strain in my journey at the same time it prepares me for the outside industry, i got out there with experience which i count as a bonus as it increases my probability of  employability. 

Also the fact that counselors are available throughout the journey for whatever support is reassuring.

27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes I'm following.
27/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
27/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

27/12/23, 10:33 PM - +263 78 714 6734: What i got from this video is that, one has to be open minded, open to trying everything possible to get where you want, seeking help to realize your potential as well as being able to listen and follow instructions without dail which will result in smooth sailing thoughout the journey.
27/12/23, 10:36 PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary from this video is that, despite having the EWYL program which is designed for better employability, the industry is always changing and growing Edoofa's vision is to help students adapt to the industry and increase chances of success of the student. 
One students has to choose for themselves where they are headed to and use to the maximum the opportunity they're offered
27/12/23, 10:52 PM - +263 78 714 6734: What i understood from this video, is that Edoofa had to investigate the school they can work with to send students to and guarantee good education at affordable prices for students. Also students will have the opportunity to interact with the schools. Things like infrastructure, education quality, education medium where all vetted and for suitable with the universities registered ander Edoofa
27/12/23, 10:58 PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary from this is the importance of the SOP. The SOP is the one chance that a student gets to stand out and maximize the scholarship they will get, as a students get to display themselves and their potential. It is important to not have unnecessary delays in this stagey

28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263787146734, In the meantime, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes i agree and understand
28/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
28/12/23, 12:53 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, we are on the same page
28/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
28/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
