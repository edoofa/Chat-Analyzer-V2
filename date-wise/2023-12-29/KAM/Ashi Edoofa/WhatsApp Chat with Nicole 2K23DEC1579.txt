27/12/23, 12:33 PM - +263 78 610 6366: We are fine and you
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am good dear, thank you for asking. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Yes thank you
27/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear,  Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 12:39 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Following

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:00 PM.
27/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

27/12/23, 12:55 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you ma'am same to you
27/12/23, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263786106366
27/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 78 610 6366: ?2    Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a furtherexplanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights.
 Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Rights are the entitlements that individuals or groups have, while duties are the obligations or responsibilities that individuals or groups have towards others or society as a whole. 

Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that are entitled to all human beings, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, religion, or any other status. These rights are inherent to human beings and are often enshrined in international law. Civil rights, on the other hand, are the rights that individuals have as citizens of a particular country. These rights are often related to political and social freedoms, such as the right to vote, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly.

In summary, while rights and duties are interconnected, human rights and civil rights are distinct concepts that refer to different types of rights.
?3: What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?
- A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their job is to investigate and prosecute individuals who are accused of committing crimes. They work closely with law enforcement officials to build a case against the defendant and present evidence in court.

An attorney, on the other hand, is a legal professional who provides legal advice and representation to individuals or organizations. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, family law, or corporate law. They may represent clients in court or in negotiations with other parties.

In summary, while both prosecutors and attorneys are legal professionals, prosecutors work for the government to prosecute criminal cases, while attorneys provide legal advice and representation to individual clients. 
4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal, and why?
I want to pursue with Criminal law because lam  drawn to the challenge of defending the accused and ensuring that justice is served. Iam also interested in the investigative and research aspects of criminal law, such as gathering evidence and building a strong case. Still l may also be interested in the social and ethical aspects of criminal law, such as advocating for the rights of the accused and working to reform the criminal justice system.

5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please
elaborate with an example
 Some of these skills that l qualify  include strong analytical and critical thinking abilities, excellent communication and interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work well under pressure.

For example, a successful lawyer may need to analyze complex legal documents and arguments, communicate effectively with clients and other stakeholders, pay close attention to details in contracts or other legal documents, and handle high-pressure situations such as court hearings or negotiations and l believe that l have all these skills
28/12/23, 10:58 AM - +263 78 610 6366: 1. Give a brief introduction, highlighting your skills with an example

28/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 272 2801: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024).
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

28/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Thank you noted
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Thank you noted
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263772722801. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Yes it is correct thank you
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Trying to join group it's raining and there is poor network
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear,  As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted
28/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Duly noted it means l will choose one University
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Thank you for the clarity but interms of ranking and exposure we actually need your help since we are not well versed with Indian Universities
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted thank you
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted thank you
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Yes l understand it was explained in previous sessions and my parents were also asked to verify if they can afford and they committed themselves
28/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772722801 May I know if we are still connected?
28/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Network was down
28/12/23, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue now?
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Yes l did
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350 . The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 8:16 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted thank you
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 8:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263772722801 , As I was looking forward for your response, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 10:47 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you ma'am
28/12/23, 10:56 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you ma'am for the well explained information .Duly noted apologies for the late response due to network issues
