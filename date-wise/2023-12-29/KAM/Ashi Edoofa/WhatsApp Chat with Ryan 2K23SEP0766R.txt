20/12/23, 1:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 2:26 PM - +260 96 8651816: It's been a pleasure having you as my administrator, thank you sir.
20/12/23, 3:43 PM - +260 97 7408010: Thank you Mr. Shivjeet for your counsel and guidance. All the best in your new endeavours.

Mrs. Bella Mwale 
(Ryan's mother.)
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 96 8651816: @919650537098 I'm available
27/12/23, 3:29 PM - +260 97 7408010: Am also here, though my husband is working and being manager IT it's hard for him, unless in the evening after 21:00hrs.
27/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you are ready for the session today, Before we start our session, May I kindly if you have gone through the videos shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
27/12/23, 3:30 PM - +260 97 7408010: This is Ryan's mother 🙏🏾
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes I did
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to meet @260977408010
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +260 97 7408010: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: Okay so I learned from this video edoofa gives the opportunity for students to live independently on the scholarship credits which are earned by the individual and lastly we must be open minded and willing to learn.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: On this one I learned edoofa not only to get a pupil admitted into a school but to also to find employment, we must also follow all protocols advised by the admission officers.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: From this video I learned we must be prompt at all times to ensure during the time when I'm interacting with the university or college I must be fit enough to handle. And my attitude, skill and my knowledge also matters throughout my education journey.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: I learned that the statement of purpose is the most critical stage for it is where I will be required to Express my wild endeavors to why I would like to be enrolled into their respected universities or colleges
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @260968651816, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am I was able to understand from the videos
27/12/23, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 4:14 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes we are ma'am.
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
27/12/23, 4:22 PM - +260 96 8651816: I can complete the tasks before 9:00AM tomorrow and submit.
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the task. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
27/12/23, 4:26 PM - +260 96 8651816: Thank you for your time madam.
27/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @260968651816
28/12/23, 12:07 AM - +260 96 8651816: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q2. Thermodynamics is the study of the effects of work, heavy, and energy on a system. It is only concerned with macroscopic change and observations such as change in temperature. Thermodynamics is in general terms concerned with the transition of energy from one position to another and from one form to another. 
There are three laws of thermodynamics known to man which are as follows the first law states when energy moves in or out of the system. The systems internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of mass in simpler terms energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another for example kinetic engery - the energy that an object possesses when it moves it is converted to heat energy when a driver presses the brakes on the car to slow it down.
The second law states there exists a useful state variable called entropy. The change in entropy is equal th the heat transfer divided by the temperature. An example when we put an ice cube in a cup with water at room temperature. The water at room temperature releases off heat and the ice cube melts, hence the entropy of water drops.
The third law states the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as temperature approaches zero for example vapour of water at high temperatures as the molecules within steam are randomly moving this it will have a high entropy.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q3. A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid by opening, closing or partially obstructing various passageways. 
A butterfly valve is a type of a valve which is used to shut the flow of fluid. It is often said that butterfly valves can be used to regulate the flow of fluid, however it is not recommended using it as it can damage the valve disk and have a negative effect on the sealing properties. The valve requires less structural support than a ball valve of comparable diameter. These valves are commonly used in pipe lines in handling large fluid flows.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q4. Heat treating is a group of industrial thermal and metal working processes used to alter the physical and sometimes chemical properties of the material. It can also be defined as the heating or chilling normally to extreme temperatures to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. It is done to improve the mechanical properties of a material that include hardness, tensile, strength, shock, resistance, ductility and resistance to corrosion to improve mechinability and reduce brittleness and make the versatile.
Heat treatment are also used in the manufacture of many other materials such as glass. Although the term heat treatment applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for specific of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing such as hot forming or welding.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q5. A compressor can be defined as an instrument or device used to compress something or a machine used to supply air or other gas at increased pressure for example to a gas turbine.
There are thirteen types of compressors created by man namely centrifugal compressor, rotary - screw compressor, scroll compressors, axial compressor, rotary vane compressor, compressor, dynamic compressor, rotary screw compressor, reciprocating compressor, piston compressor, classification of air compressor and oil free compressor.
Centrifugal compressor is used to power gas turbines engines used in jet aircrafts. It is used because turbines are used due to higher rotating speeds and the centrifugal compressor are used in pipeline booster services where high volume and low compression ratios exist.

28/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for today's session?
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +260 96 8651816: Afternoon ma'am, I'm ready for today's session.
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @260968651816, Before we start our today's session, May I know if you are connected with your mentor?
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - +260 96 8651816: At the time being I do not have a mentor ma'am.
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have filled the EWYL form?
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +260 96 8651816: This was the form I filled ma'am I'm not sure if this is the one you speak of?
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Let me share the ewyl form with you so that you can fill the same.
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Friday (05th January 2024)*. If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. 

However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.
28/12/23, 2:50 PM - +260 96 8651816: Let me fill the form now
28/12/23, 2:57 PM - +260 96 8651816: @919650537098 Is the form due today ma'am?
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, You can share it with tomorrow if there is any challenge
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we move forward?
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am.
28/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:16 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes it is.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am, it is most certainly is not possible.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am we discussed on that topic.
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 3:32 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes we are
28/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
28/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 3:45 PM - +260 97 7408010: Iam also following but the father will catch up in the evening as we are the main sponsors of Ryan as his biological parents.

Thank you for the information. Let us also go thru with my husband, but Ryan is keenly following as your prospective incoming Student.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @260977408010, I indeed resonate with you.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 8:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @260977408010 @260968651816 As I was looking forward for your response, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
