28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 78 814 9138: they are clear l am.understanding them
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 78 814 9138: yes I am following
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.
