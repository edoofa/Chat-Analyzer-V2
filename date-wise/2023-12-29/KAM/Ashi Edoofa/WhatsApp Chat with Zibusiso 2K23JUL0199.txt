I trust this message finds you in good health. Over the past few days, I was expecting a response regarding the update on the remaining amount for your registration fees, however, I did not get an update from your end.
27/12/23, 11:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As per our last discussion, you mentioned that you were planning to complete the payment by 23rd December, hence we are due to update the university officials on the same. On the same note, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the current status of your financial preparations.
