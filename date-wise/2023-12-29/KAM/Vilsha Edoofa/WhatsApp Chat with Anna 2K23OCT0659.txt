28/12/23, 1:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Urgent update for your University Scholarship Application*

Good Morning Parents and Anna,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa. Following a recent discussion with Ms. Ashi regarding your scholarship application, it has come to our attention that you missed the due date to secure your scholarship seat, unfortunately resulting in not benefiting from the Endowment Program.
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: We understand that pursuing education abroad comes with challenges, and we recognize that unforeseen circumstances may have led to difficulties in securing the scholarship seat. However, given the competitive nature of scholarship opportunities, Ms. Ashi has expressed concerns about the potential loss of this valuable opportunity if we delay any longer.
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: While our team has been consistently reaching out to you to understand your concerns in-depth, time is of the essence. To proactively address this matter, I have personally scheduled a meeting with the academic board and university officials on the 31st of December 2023 to present your case and explore potential solutions.
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: To present a compelling case on your behalf, we need your assistance and specific information:

1. *Challenge/Concern Details:* Please share the specific challenges or concerns that led to missing the opportunity to secure the scholarship seat.

2. *Plans Moving Forward:* Outline your plans for moving forward in pursuing education abroad.

3. *How We Can Help:* Specify how you wish for us to assist you with the challenges you are facing.
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: You have to share this information in a single message with us after discussing it with your family by the end of tomorrow. Your timely update is important for us to thoroughly understand your situation and find the most effective way to support you before our scheduled meeting on the 31st of December, and hence we hope you will take this update seriously and share the necessary details.

Best regards,  
Ms. Vilsha  
Head of Admissions
