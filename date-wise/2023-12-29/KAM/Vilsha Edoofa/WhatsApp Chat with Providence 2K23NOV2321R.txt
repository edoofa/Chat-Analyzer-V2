I trust this message finds you well, and I hope that the network challenges you were experiencing yesterday have been resolved by now. Yesterday, I was engaged in a series of meetings, which unfortunately kept me from connecting with you.
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: On a positive note, during one of these meetings, I received an update from the accounts team regarding the payment you made for your enrollment fee and the balance you have for the remaining part of your fee. 

I am delighted to inform you that the accounts team has successfully confirmed the payment and has shared the payment receipt with us. Please find the payment receipt detailed below:
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the receipt for your reference. Once you have confirmed the details, we can not only discuss the preparations you have made for the remaining part of the fee but also move forward with your next steps. 

Rest assured, I will guide you through the procedures for the 2025 academic intake, ensuring a smooth transition into the next phase of your academic journey.
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 78 582 3356: The weather is unfavourable here ma'am.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Providence and I hope you were also able to taken a note of the payment receipt that I shared with you for the first part of your Edoofa Enrollment Fee. 

As I was organizing my schedule and reviewing your application file, I noticed that the due date for your remaining Edoofa enrollment fee of $150 is on December 30, 2023, Saturday. This encouraged me to connect with you and inquire about your progress. Have you been able to raise the entire amount and make the deposit for your fee? 

I am keen to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly on your end.

28/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Tomorrow at 12:00
28/12/23, 3:05 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay, Providence. I have taken note of the same update and we will connect with each other for the same accordingly. In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion.

Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
