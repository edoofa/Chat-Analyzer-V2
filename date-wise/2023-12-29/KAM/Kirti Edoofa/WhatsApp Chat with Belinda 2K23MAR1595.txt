In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
26/12/23, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Belinda.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion, I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
26/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 273 3391: It's OK go ahead
26/12/23, 6:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, could you please go through the offer letter and share your response about the same?
26/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 273 3391: I went through it
26/12/23, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
26/12/23, 6:27 PM - +263 77 273 3391: 1. 900
2. 4
3. 
4. 750
26/12/23, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 77 273 3391: Understood
26/12/23, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
26/12/23, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
26/12/23, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
26/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 273 3391: The last option maybe affordable
26/12/23, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
26/12/23, 7:33 PM - +263 77 273 3391: How does one access the off campus accommodation
26/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772733391 Once Belinda arrives in India, our officials will help her with the off- campus accommodation.
26/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
26/12/23, 10:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
27/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 77 273 3391: Good day
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 77 273 3391: Go ahead
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
27/12/23, 4:26 PM - +263 77 273 3391: It's clear
27/12/23, 4:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
27/12/23, 4:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - +263 77 273 3391: This was explained
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - +263 77 273 3391: Yes I am aware
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/12/23, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
