I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

Reminder 👆
28/12/23, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772326764 I definitely recall your request and I'm here to clarify it for you. The process is such that the university issues the tuition fee invoice only after all your admission procedures are fully completed. The invoice will be provided to you whenever your fee is due. Your approach of paying first and then seeking reimbursement from your employer is quite standard among many students, so rest assured, you will receive the invoice in a timely manner when it's time to pay the tuition fee. There's no need for concern.
28/12/23, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you are doing well. I wanted to reach out and inform you that our accounts team is diligently working on your payment confirmation once we get an update we shall let you know in the meantime I was able to inquire with the accounts team to share the payment breakdown so that you can have clarity too.
