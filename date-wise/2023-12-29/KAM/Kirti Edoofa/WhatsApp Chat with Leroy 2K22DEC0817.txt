I hope this message reaches you in good health. *I am Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Please excuse Mr. Shivjeet for his unavailability this week, as he is engaged in meetings with university officials. In the meantime, I am here to assist you with any concerns or questions you may have.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: First of all. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
28/12/23, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind and thoughtful message. It's heartening to hear about your positive view of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and your appreciation for the efforts we made to accommodate your educational aspirations. I understand that deciding not to continue with your plans to study in India or elsewhere is a significant decision, and it must not have been easy for you. Please know that your decision is respected. However, for us to have clarity could you please help me understand the sudden change in your plans, maybe this will help me understand you better?
