I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Very clear
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

During my counseling session with my Edoofa counselor, I had the opportunity to discuss my educational goals, aspirations, and career interests. The counselor took the time to understand my background, strengths, and areas of improvement. They provided valuable guidance and advice on various programs and scholarship opportunities 

What impressed me the most about the counseling session was the personalized approach. The counselor took a genuine interest in understanding my individual needs and aspirations 
Additionally, the Edoofa Scholarship Program itself has left a lasting impression on me. The program offers a comprehensive package that goes beyond just financial assistance. It provides mentorship, career guidance, and internship opportunities to help students develop their skills and gain practical experience. This holistic approach to education is something that I find extremely valuable and unique.

Furthermore, Edoofa’s emphasis on creating a supportive community for students is commendable. The program connects students from diverse backgrounds, allowing them to learn from each other, share experiences, and build a strong network. This sense of belonging and support is crucial in ensuring the overall growth and success of students.

Overall, the counseling session with my Edoofa counselor and the various aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have impressed me greatly. The personalized guidance, comprehensive support, and focus on community-building make it a standout program for students like me who are looking for not just financial assistance but also holistic development opportunities.

I have known Mr. Shashwat for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track. It sounds like the counseling session was particularly impactful, offering you a personalized and thorough discussion about your educational aspirations and career goals.

27/12/23, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
27/12/23, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Done ✅
27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +263 77 364 3205: That sound clear
27/12/23, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:36 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah sure
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Its very clear
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Oky then

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we can

28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 77 364 3205: From the first video I have learned that students are required to be teachable, and open minded and they’re recommended to follow all Edoofa’s instructions and so on .2nd and third videos they said Edoofa helps students with affordable quality education making them employable and they .they also have a plenty number of schools and colleges they’re connected to giving an example of why they had to choose the best schools or institute. Then from the fourth video they enlighten me about the statement of purpose SOP every student is given an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment,skills to convince the board of different schools for them to get scholarships. It is a very important document which a student should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out. Edoofa invested 10 years for the best of Edoofians
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

28/12/23, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.

28/12/23, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.
