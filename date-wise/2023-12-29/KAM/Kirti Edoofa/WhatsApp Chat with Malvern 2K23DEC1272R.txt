27/12/23, 4:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:40 PM - +27 84 789 5012: We can proceed
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:47 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I have gone through the picture, we can continue
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Clear!!
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 5:12 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Following, about the 1 hour session, is it a video call or just chatting
27/12/23, 5:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27847895012 it will be through texts, on WhatsApp please do not worry.
27/12/23, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Understood
27/12/23, 5:19 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Sounds good, clear
27/12/23, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 5:24 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Let's do it
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - +27 84 789 5012: M ready
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
27/12/23, 6:47 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Okay thank you I have received all the videos and by the time I finish watching all of them l will not be able to respond because I am at internet cafe and it closes at 7 which is soon so we can reschedule for tomorrow if that's okay
27/12/23, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, we can connect tomorrow, it is alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I hope by that time you will be able to go through the videos

28/12/23, 12:04 AM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you
28/12/23, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Malvern,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:25 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Greetings to you Ms Kirti, I am having a marvelous day, how are you.
28/12/23, 1:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and I am glad to know that you are having a great day. May I know if you were able to go through the videos?

28/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Well, from the first video which was the message for enrollled students, the 2 emphasized points which I picked were to follow every instruction and being open minded. the second video was about the Edoofa`s  vision for us as students that it recognizes everyone and that only helps a lot for someone to reach his/her goals. in addition to the3rd video which was about the colleges and universities, they emphasized that one should be able to interact with the cuniversity and also follow given instructions, hard working to invest. the preparation for interactive sessions with schools was mentioned in the last video as students were encouraged to explain their ambitions, visions and motivations why they enroll into the Edoofa program. This is just a few that I picked
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/12/23, 2:00 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you for fully explaining that to me, I am enlightened.

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

28/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.
