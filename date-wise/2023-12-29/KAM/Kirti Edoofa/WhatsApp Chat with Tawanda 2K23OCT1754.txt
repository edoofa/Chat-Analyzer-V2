26/12/23, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tawanda,

I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 30th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?
26/12/23, 9:42 PM - +263 77 963 3845: Good evening sir yes the deposit will be made before 30 December
26/12/23, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
28/12/23, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tawanda.

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit on the 30th however, the 30th being Saturday the banks might be closed. So I hope you take our recommendation and make the deposit a day before so that your deadline is not affected. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?

28/12/23, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I understand that Mr. Rajan is not available, however, as your deadline is tomorrow you will need to make the deposit tomorrow only since your extension has already been approved by the university officials and they are aware of the same date. So may I know if you would like to explore other payment modes?
