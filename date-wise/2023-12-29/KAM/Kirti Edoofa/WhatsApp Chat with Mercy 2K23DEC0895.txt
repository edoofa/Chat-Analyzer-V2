Now that you've successfully completed your enrollment formalities, the commencement of your admission journey is scheduled for December 21st, 2023, starting at 12:30 PM. To ensure a productive discussion, please ensure a smooth internet connection for the session.

Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on December 29th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.

Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we shall start
28/12/23, 4:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I have updated the form

28/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I had gone through the cycle we can proceed
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 may I know if we are still connected?
28/12/23, 7:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am
28/12/23, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes they are clear l got you
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But if l may ask do you mean that my academic progress determines the university l will study at
28/12/23, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern Mercy, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. 

I hope we are clear here?
28/12/23, 8:14 PM - +263 78 006 5624: How will l get the offer letter
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l understand so l will know how much percentage  of the scholarship will l get after my A level results are out
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Here is the online form it was not send by my Email address l used this one tsitsihwanya04@gmail.com
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the student application form, it is duly noted with us.
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
28/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
28/12/23, 9:52 PM - +263 78 006 5624: You are almost welcome
