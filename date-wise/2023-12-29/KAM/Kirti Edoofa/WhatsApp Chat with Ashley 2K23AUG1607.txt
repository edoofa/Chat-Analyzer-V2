I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 29th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message @263773508876 @263714008973 ?
28/12/23, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if we are still in communication? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?

28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Saturday or Sunday
28/12/23, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for updating me. I understand you might be out of town, but considering Ashley's deadline is tomorrow, I'm a bit confused about your plan to make the payment on Saturday. Could you please clarify your reasoning for this timing?
