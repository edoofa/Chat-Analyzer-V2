*"The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change." - Carl Rogers*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 439 7083: Good morning.Yes l am
16/12/23, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mnqobi!
16/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
16/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l did
16/12/23, 10:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
16/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes  indeed the History of India .. Especially the  successful Business people Who are currently  heading Conglomerates and Global Companies.. As wide Skills range offered  by over 1000 Universities thus quite amazing .. The lndian Education Policy which offers a diversity and inclusion
16/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 439 7083: The rapid growing indian Technological  Economy is so inspiring   to learn that  India is the 3rd largest country with most Billionaires is just highly motivating
16/12/23, 11:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
16/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 439 7083: Am not very familiar but what l know is that it is very expensive to fund one self  when you don't have a scholarship
16/12/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mnqobi! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
16/12/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes with payment arrangements it is affordable
16/12/23, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mnqobi. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
16/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l do have an idea
16/12/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel free to share the information.
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Ok it sounds impressive as one may be exposed to the world of work while doing studies 👏👏
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mnqobi. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Okay may l watch the webinars later right now am supposed to pitch up at event so l may be available after 4 to 5 hours then we can continue our session.Is it okay ?
16/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mnqobi. May I know what time is convenient for you, please?
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 439 7083: 7pm is okay
16/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mnqobi. Let us connect at *7:00 P.M. CAT* to resume your session. I will be looking forward to your response.
16/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Okay will do so
16/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 227 2570: Thank u very much .....will communicate if ever there are any challenges....thank you once more
18/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l am
18/12/23, 10:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mnqobi!
18/12/23, 10:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
18/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l do
18/12/23, 11:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mnqobi! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
18/12/23, 11:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 439 7083: They are looking forward for the opportunity of doing my tertiary level of education abroad and also taking part in the EWYL Program
18/12/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
18/12/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
18/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Requirements are  application forms, letter of. recommendations ,A Level results ,passport or national id, proof of residence
18/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/12/23, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
18/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
18/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 439 7083: There was no electricity am now back online
18/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l am following..l understand
18/12/23, 4:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 439 7083: There is an extra role that l have to play that helps financially and my parents also have their financial role to play and the fees can be paid once off or in form of installments
18/12/23, 5:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
18/12/23, 5:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 439 7083: Phase 1, 2 ,3 ,4 and currently in phase 5
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 439 7083: You can explain 5 and 6 ..then we will continue tomorrow because there is lighting so am switching off electric gadgets
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/12/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session. May I know whether that is convenient for you, please?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

20/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 227 2570: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 227 2570: I understand the financial implications.. However should he be admitted l would be able to settle (pay ) the $200 by end of  January and the Balance Mid February..Bacause we have to pay University fees for her sister as well in January who will be doing her final year at NUST  Zimbabwe.
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly provide more details about your concerns regarding the financial dates, Mrs. Bhebhe? I assure you that I am here to address any issues, and I will make every effort to devise a more accommodating financial plan for you. There have been instances in the past where parents expressed their concerns to me, and in response, I advocated to the board for an extension of the deadline to ensure greater convenience for them.
20/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 227 2570: Ok l understand..Like l indicated  with our December and part of our January income we shall be paying for the Sisters first semester in NUST..then part of January and February income we can use it to settle for Mnqobi ..l hope am clear now .. February savings may be enough to clear Mnqobi's $350
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that the recent completion of fee formalities has posed some challenges for you in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 227 2570: Ok l understand.we can discuss
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Mnqobi's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Mnqobi's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it? <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 227 2570: Ok l understand...let us  discuss further as family again. and work out figures and come back to you tomorrow
20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 09:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session     

Stay Blessed!
