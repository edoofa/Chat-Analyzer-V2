16/12/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
16/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 133 9475: as i have read  studying in india can make my study be affordable and flexible and i will be able to use a flexible language and i can do some researches too and improve my critical thinking so i can hit my goals perfectly
16/12/23, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
16/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 133 9475: i don't know
16/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Makomborero! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
16/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 133 9475: we  can not afford it
16/12/23, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
16/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 133 9475: paying the (2000-3000) per year
16/12/23, 3:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
16/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 133 9475: its 300  per semester leaving off campus
16/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
16/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 133 9475: no i would not want that type of education
16/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
16/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 133 9475: ohh i see
16/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 133 9475: thats nice
16/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 133 9475: can the parents answer this question
16/12/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Makomborero. I will be waiting for their response.
16/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 490 3667: We have another child whos is writing o level exams next year so we thinking of  a gap year to Makomborero's university admission but i thought if we could find  fully funded scholarship it could help us <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 5:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Theresa! <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 5:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what is your understanding of the word "Fully Funded Scholarship", please?
16/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 490 3667: Fully funded scholarship means everything catered for
16/12/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 133 9475: thank you
18/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 133 9475: yea
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Makomborero!
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether that is clear, please?
18/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 133 9475: clear
18/12/23, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether your parents have read this message, please?
18/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 133 9475: okay

*“The great aim of education is not knowledge, but action.” - Herbert Spencer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 133 9475: yes
19/12/23, 9:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Makomborero!
19/12/23, 9:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
19/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 133 9475: yes
19/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 133 9475: yes i have
19/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this message, please?
19/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 133 9475: yes it a good way to reduce the finance
19/12/23, 11:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
19/12/23, 11:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/12/23, 11:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 133 9475: the third one
19/12/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 133 9475: they are okay with it
19/12/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
19/12/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
19/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 133 9475: oaky
19/12/23, 11:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
19/12/23, 11:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/12/23, 11:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
19/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 133 9475: okay
19/12/23, 11:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
19/12/23, 11:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 133 9475: okay i see
19/12/23, 11:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
19/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 133 9475: network problems
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly answer this question?
19/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 133 9475: Edoofa helps to reduce the burden of paying the enrollment fees and others so it just makes you pay 350 for. all the procedures and its cheap for us
19/12/23, 4:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
19/12/23, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 133 9475: 6
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 133 9475: we last talked about 5  enrollment
19/12/23, 4:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
19/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 133 9475: yes
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
19/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session. May I know whether that is convenient for you, please?

19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

21/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The classroom is a canvas, and each lesson is a stroke that contributes to the masterpiece of a well-rounded mind." - Unknown*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
21/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 809 0876: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/12/23, 9:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
21/12/23, 9:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
21/12/23, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
21/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 809 0876: The very truth about Zimbabwe.
21/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 809 0876: Very interesting.
21/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 809 0876: We would opt for the 1st one, where we have to pay $200 within 7 days the remainder in 30 days
21/12/23, 11:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
21/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 809 0876: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director.

Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
