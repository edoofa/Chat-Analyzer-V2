19/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Takudzwa, Mr and Mrs Madzonkanyika!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
19/12/23, 8:47 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
20/12/23, 7:54 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

21/12/23, 7:41 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

22/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but I am under the weather today, so I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
