However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
19/12/23, 10:34 am - +27 78 130 8695: definitely  yes, I'm willing to give my all
19/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/12/23, 12:14 pm - +27 78 130 8695: India has always been a country that fascinated me with its rich history, divers culture, and vibrant traditions. Studying aboard was always  my dream. By me growing up in an Indian community and studying at an Indian school so studying in India will be like home away from home additionally, India is renowned for its strong education system and the opportunities it offers to students from around the world.
19/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Studying computer applications in India can significantly contribute to the development of the education system in Zimbabwe by providing valuable insights and knowledge about the successful integration of ICT tools and technologies in education. India has made remarkable progress in incorporating computer applications into their education system, and by studying this model, Zimbabwe can gain insights into strategies for effective implementation, curriculum design, infrastructure development, teacher training, and resource allocation.
This knowledge can help Zimbabwe overcome the challenges it faces in terms of ICT infrastructure and ensure a smoother integration of computer applications in classrooms
19/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Prince, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes I agree
19/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
19/12/23, 1:14 pm - +27 78 130 8695: yes, i was also wondering why Edoofa recommends India
19/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

19/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 78 130 8695: This is really interesting
19/12/23, 1:41 pm - +27 65 630 5560: Wow I'm learning something here ...this is interesting to know
19/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now Princee, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 78 130 8695: thank you so much i really understood so far
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - +27 78 130 8695: No we are not familiar with the costs
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/12/23, 3:00 pm - +27 78 130 8695: I really thank God for this program actually it's the best program for me or anyone planning to come to study  in India. Knowing the fact that my parents can not afford to take me to the best universities in South Africa this scholarship is going to help me to achieve my dream of having a successful career
19/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
19/12/23, 3:18 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes please you can brief me about it
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Prince, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 3:33 pm - +27 78 130 8695: wow that  is really interesting

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
19/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

19/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - +27 78 130 8695: I learnt that EWYL program helps with the growth of a student it will also prepare me for life after graduation. In that case I strongly agree with it
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Prince, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - +27 78 130 8695: That's a very good program it's interesting
19/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
19/12/23, 4:10 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes this is so encouraging watching other students doing it, I will definitely be able to do the same
19/12/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Prince, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes that's true
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes we did, they are supporting me
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes I am ready
19/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Prince as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 4:21 pm - +27 78 130 8695: It would be $1500-$2250
19/12/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Prince, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Okay noted
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes I think so
19/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Prince basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/12/23, 4:26 pm - +27 78 498 2719: I won't be online for the next hour I'm driving home from work
19/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: However as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I proceed ahead?
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes you can proceed
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
19/12/23, 4:31 pm - +27 78 130 8695: No I am not really familiar with the Edoofa cycle
19/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Prince, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in South Africa itself.
19/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Yes I understand the steps so far
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - +27 78 130 8695: During the holidays when schools are closed is it possible for me to travel back home to see my family and come back to India
19/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that totally depends on you.
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - +27 78 130 8695: Thank you very much
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

1. The title that best suits the passage would be:

d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger

My High School Journey: Overcoming Friendship Challenges and Building Connections


At the beginning of my high school journey, I faced various challenges in navigating friendships and building connections. High school friendships extend beyond the classroom, and it became apparent to me that these external connections were just as significant as those formed within the school environment. The stages of relationship development, from initiating to bonding, played a crucial role in shaping my experiences during this time.

As I reflect on my high school years, I find it important to highlight the impact of friendship dynamics on adolescents with varying levels of self-esteem. The challenges of school transitions, the initiation and dissolution of friendships, and maintenance strategies were all crucial aspects of my journey. The interviews conducted for this chapter have provided insights into the significance of friendships as contexts for self-exploration and validation, especially in relation to levels of trust, loyalty, and support.

Throughout my high school journey, the importance of peer friendship and communication became evident, not only in my personal life but also in my academic experiences. The positive and negative experiences I encountered shed light on how universities can enhance the overall student experience. Learning to navigate the complexities of friendships and connections has been a profound part of my growth during high school, and I am eager to share my journey of overcoming these challenges and building meaningful connections. As I conclude my high school journey, I am reminded of the invaluable lessons learned through navigating friendships and building connections. The impact of friendship dynamics on adolescents with varying levels of self-esteem has been a significant part of my experience. The challenges and transitions that come with high school have further solidified the understanding of the importance of peer relationships in shaping socialization during adolescence.

Throughout this journey, it has become evident that the quality of friendships plays a crucial role in individuals' social adjustment and stress management. My experiences have highlighted the positive influence of high-quality friendships in building self-esteem and supporting personal growth during this pivotal stage of life.


Looking ahead, I believe that the insights gained from my high school journey will continue to guide me in forming and maintaining positive peer relationships in the future. As I move forward, I am eager to apply these lessons to further enhance my personal development and contribute to a positive and supportive social environment.
