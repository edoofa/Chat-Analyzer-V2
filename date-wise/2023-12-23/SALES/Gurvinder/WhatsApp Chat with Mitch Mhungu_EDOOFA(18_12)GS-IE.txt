20/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mitch, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, is that correct?
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes it is
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, also do tell me whether you learnt about Valerie’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Honestly I haven't learnt much about the Edoofa program except that it offers scholarships , however she did mention that her journey was and still is enjoyable. India offers languages which include English
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Valerie who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship  as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes she did introduce me to the parameters.
20/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well she did give me an example of a 60 percent scholarship and the student has to pay 40 percent on other expenses
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Along with examination fees
20/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 825 3372: However I would prefer a 100% scholarship.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mitch, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?

21/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
21/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?

21/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Data science, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
21/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well I have found performing the same task over and over again cumbersome and boring hence discouraging . Hence I search for the best field of study that is not repetitive and goes hand in hand with the passion I have for particular subjects of study such as Economics and Statistics . Data science is complex in  nature and has no particular definition really,  however it can simply be put as the study of information or data to bring out certain results.  This said I find it interesting as data or information  collected  is quite broad and meeting the same exact information is very low hence it can bring out the best in me. Furthermore Data science requires teamwork which I am quite fond of as I played team sports like basketball during High school,  also it requires critical thinking which is my strong suit as I am a chess nationalist.
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to pursue data science is driven by a combination of factors that resonate with the field's complexity, diversity, and the alignment of your skills and interests.
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 212 7223: Should Mitch pursue this particular field of study he will be the first.
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Unfortunately sir I do not have a hold of them as we speak,  I would appreciate it if I can be able to send them tomorrow morning.  I am sorry for the inconvenience.
21/12/23, 7:40 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
