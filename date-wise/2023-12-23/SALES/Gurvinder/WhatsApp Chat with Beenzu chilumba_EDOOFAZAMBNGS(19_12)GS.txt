I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session
19/12/23, 11:41 am - +260 97 1142911: Thank you
19/12/23, 11:41 am - +260 97 1142911: Am ready
19/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the program?
19/12/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes sure
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:08 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes thank you I have read through and I would be proud to be an edoofian am definitely looking forward to it
19/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs.Mercy, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes please...
19/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Mercy, I would like to know Beenzu better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?

5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?


Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

21/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 1142911: Good morning thanks 🙏
21/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Mercy, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
21/12/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 1142911: Noted... Am confident enough that Beenzu's final grade 12 results will be very good in terms of the mentioned three subjects. She had really improved in terms of performance..... she can take the course Bachelor of science in nutrition and Dietetics... your advice please 🙏
21/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Mrs Mercy, I would be happy to offer her *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*.
21/12/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 1142911: It would be our pleasure.
21/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - +260 97 1142911: Well noted
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 1142911: Sure
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
21/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 1142911: Okay so interesting she would really love it
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which she has chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is she willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way inorder to transform her career?
21/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 1142911: Yes she is ready to put in her best.
21/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why she wants to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - +260 97 1142911: The reason is that studying abroad offers diverse benefits such as exposure to different cultures, access to world class education, language, emersion and the chance to build a global network. additionally, it provides an opportunity for personal growth, independence and a broader perspective which can enhance career prospects in an increasingly interconnected world.
22/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
