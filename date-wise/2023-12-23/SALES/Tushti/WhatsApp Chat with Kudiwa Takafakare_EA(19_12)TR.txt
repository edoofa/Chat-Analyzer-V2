21/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 075 4748: Ma'am can I please respond as soon as I settle. I'm currently walking and I'm unable to type properly while doing so
21/12/23, 11:54 am - Tushti: Sure
21/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 075 4748: Thank you for the patience ma'am Tushti. Well I'm Kudiwa Ann Takafakare and I'm aged 17. My family and l have lived in Glen View 4 Harare for the past 12 years. My strengths are in playing chess , school and also being a source of motivation to others through speaking. My weakness is the inability to resist unhealthy food. As for my hobbies , I enjoy watching TV , reading novels and playing chess.

The Takafakare family is a lovely family and big as well. Since the year I was born , we moved to four different places ; Roadsville , Arcadia , glen View 3 until my paternal grandfather passed away in 2008 and we had to move in with my grandmother in Glenview 4 since she didn't have anyone to live with anymore , so it's been 12 years. My father is now a Transcriber and my mother is a teacher. Most of the times when I go to school , she won't be at home because the school she teaches is approximately 145 kilometers away from home so she is usually home only on holidays

I'm currently in L5 and studying History , Shona , Family Religious Studies and Communication skills. My dream is to become a lawyer one day because I have good advocating qualities. Another reason of wanting to become a lawyer is , I'm I was deeply hurt due to the conviction of my best friend's father because he couldn't afford a good lawyer to stand for him , so I'm driven by empathy as well as passion to stand up for the truth. 

Both of my parents went to University and that is their highest education level. I have 2 siblings. 1 is an eleven year old boy who is still at primary level and I have an older sister who is 18 years old and she's currently waiting for her results as she wrote her final exams in November which were Chemistry , Biology and Mathematics. My parents are the ones who have been financially supporting me for my education so far and l believe they will be doing the same at my higher education abroad.I learn at Harare high school and the fees from my school is $90 per term. The province is Harare
21/12/23, 3:34 pm - Tushti: Thank you so much for such a well worded introduction
21/12/23, 3:34 pm - Tushti: I would now like to know whether your elder sister and you both wish to enroll with Edoofa?
21/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 075 4748: No. Unfortunately she has other plans
21/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 075 4748: Pmy pleasure
21/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 075 4748: *My
21/12/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: I would now like for the parents to come online and join the discussion
21/12/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 075 4748: Noted ma'am
22/12/23, 9:29 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 075 4748: Morning ma'am Tushti. Yes let's continue
22/12/23, 9:57 am - Tushti: I hope the parent is online
22/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 259 7838: This message was deleted
22/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 259 7838: Yes lm her mother
22/12/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: Now, Kudiwa mentioned there are younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are you facing such a situation?
22/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 259 7838: Yes we are facing that challenge
22/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 235 4748: Hello
I am Kudiwa's Father
22/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 235 4748: This message was deleted
22/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 235 4748: Yes very challenging indeed
22/12/23, 11:25 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
22/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 259 7838: That is the reason why we are looking for full time scholarship
22/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: @263772597838 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 075 4748: Thanks for the elaboration. I was actually one of the students you mentioned who didn't know the difference. But now I do
22/12/23, 2:50 pm - Tushti: So now, do you feel the family is prepared financially to avail the scholarship?
22/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 075 4748: Let me discuss it with them. I'll get back to you
22/12/23, 2:53 pm - Tushti: Noted
