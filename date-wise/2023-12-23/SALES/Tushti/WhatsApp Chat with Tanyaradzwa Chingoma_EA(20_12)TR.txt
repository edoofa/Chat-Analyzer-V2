21/12/23, 11:45 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
21/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 069 6778: Yes, that's why my younger sibling is at a day school and I'm at a boarding school. The inflation rate in our country is very high
21/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
21/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Kindly ask the parent to answer
