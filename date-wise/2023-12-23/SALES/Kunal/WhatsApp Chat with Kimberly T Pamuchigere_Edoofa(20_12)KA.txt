From a young age, I've always been interested in the complex interplay between the law and society.

21/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 058 1069: I may not have direct experience in the legal field yet, but I've always been fascinated by how the law shapes our society. Even without working in a law office, I've learned a lot about the legal system and its impact on people's lives through my studies and extracurricular activities. I believe that my drive to learn and my passion for justice make me a good fit for a career in law, even though I don't have.Here's how I could add that to the answer...In addition to my academic studies, I've also participated in a mock trial competition in high school. This experience gave me a firsthand look at what it's like to argue a case in court and advocate for a cause. I gained valuable experience in presenting arguments, questioning witnesses, and researching legal issues. This experience further solidified my desire to pursue a career in the legal field.
21/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Kimberly

Your comprehensive explanation of your passion for law and your experiences, especially the participation in a high school mock trial competition, is impressive. It's evident that you've actively sought opportunities to engage with the legal system, even without direct professional experience.

21/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: That is alright
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 058 1069: I am very much confident about achieving them
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion towards law, you are eligible to pursue

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
22/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 058 1069: I can give you a range of costs, based on the information I've gathered. For tuition, the average cost for international students at leading universities in India is between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. For living expenses, the average cost for international students in cities like Delhi and Bangalore is between $3,000 and $6,000 per year. That's what l only gathered during the course of the time l discovered edoofa existed .l have actually been meaning to ask you as well.
22/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 058 1069: Hello
22/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: I see you have researched well
22/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

22/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 058 1069: Ohhhky
22/12/23, 11:22 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
22/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 058 1069: I understand
22/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 058 1069: If l get the edoofa scholarship will the income l earn from Earn while you learn program be mine
22/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 058 1069: Also .. Given the cost savings that Edoofa can provide, are there any trade-offs in terms of quality or access to resources for students who choose this option?.

However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Please address this
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Yes ! l think this will be benefiting me because   The Earn While You Learn Program offers a unique opportunity for students to gain real-world experience while they pursue their education. By working on projects that are relevant to their field of study, students gain a deeper understanding of the concepts they are learning in class and a greater appreciation for the real-world applications of their knowledge. Additionally, they develop important soft skills such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are essential for success in any career.

Overall, the program benefits students by preparing them for the modern workplace and helping them stand out.This is something one has to commend about edoofa
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
22/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Oky l have understood

Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
