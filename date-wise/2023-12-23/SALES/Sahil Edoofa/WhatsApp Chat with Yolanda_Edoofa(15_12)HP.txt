So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
16/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 626 6679: I have understood that not only does the program change my Academic life for the better it also gives me experience of the various diverse cultures of life.

Amongst all the important aspects of the program i also appreciated that i get to earn whilist i learn which is actually a lovely way of giving me an insight of the world outside the educational sector.

And most importantly I understood that through the edofian scholarship program i get to pursue my dreams in an environment where i feel welcome and also in such a way that  doesn't empty my parents' pockets.
16/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion, Yolanda.
16/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Well received, Yolanda, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you for equipping me with this information about the program Ms Harmehak.
16/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Yolanda.
16/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 626 6679: The pleasure is all mine, Ms Harmehak
16/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes am really looking forward to that infact am actually hoping that i also get enrolled just like the other 2000 students. This will have a huge life changing impact on my future and more importantly my family as their financial burden would be reduced like you have already mentioned.
16/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Yolanda.
16/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Yolanda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mufakose one high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 626 6679: I go by the name Yolanda Tafadzwa Matura like you already know . I am a very dedicated and hard-working student. I am a quiet person by nature but however I can with others well if given the chance. I did my grade one to seven at Glenview 7 Primary School and complete my form one to four studies at Loreto High School in Kwekwe. Mufakose one high charged one hundred dollars per term. I wish to study aerospace engineering. Generally am very good with numbers and I love learning new things. I love playing basketball and cricket however am not really good at cricket, the sport just amuses me.

As for my family I come from a family of eight with me having four siblings. My mother's is a teacher by profession.  My father is a banker by profession
16/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Yolanda, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
16/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 626 6679: My pleasure Ms Harmehak
16/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
16/12/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ma'am
18/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Yolanda, may I know more about your siblings please?
18/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes ma'am
18/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Go ahead please
18/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 626 6679: Can i make a correction please am sorry for that
I actually have three siblings with me being the first born. Then there's my younger brother who will be doing his form three in 2024 and is fourteen years old. His name is Willis.Then after him there's is my little sister who is ten years old and will be doing grade five in 2024. Her name is Rose. Then there's my youngest brother , Dylan. This one wasn't conceived by my parents , He is my mother's younger sister's son. Both his parents are late. We have had him since he was little so that makes him my sibling right. He is going to do his grade three next year and is eight years old
18/12/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about your siblings Yolanda.

I appreciate your parents generosity as well.
18/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you ma'am
18/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
18/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Well Yolanda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak i really believe it's a life changing decision as it will change every aspect of my life and not only will it change my life it will also change my family's life as well.
18/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Very well, Yolanda,

In that case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
18/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes ma'am I am mentally prepared as it's something I have been hoping and looking forward to for a long time now
18/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Yolanda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
18/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes I do agree with you  that commitment from my parents is equally important

And yes my family members are aware and are willing to support me mentally and financially for my higher education abroad
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes I am confident that I did better
18/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you for the briefing Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I am glad.
18/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Aerospace Engineering?
18/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 626 6679: Ma'am can I please send you a copy of my O level results later i realised i would take a lot of time looking for them
18/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: I do understand Yolanda.

You can type them for now.

18/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Now Yolanda, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
18/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 626 6679: So ma'am do you advice that I opt for Mechanical engineering
18/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Yolanda.
18/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Shall I first brief you about Mechanical Engineering?
18/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes please
18/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you for that Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
18/12/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries for me?
18/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 626 6679: No i don't
18/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Thanks to what you have told me I would like to go for Mechanical engineering
18/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same itself, Yolanda?
18/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Noted please
18/12/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright Yolanda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 626 6679: In five years time I would then be working if all goes well right? ........ Since its a four year course. And I will be able to help my parents pay for my siblings' tuition fee and for me that alone is a dream come true. 

Getting into the Edoofa's Program will play a huge role in the fulfillment of my dreams since it will transfom all aspects of my life at a low expense.
18/12/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Yolanda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 626 6679: It will give me a competitive edge in the job market since many employers value international experience.

And i also get to learn different cultures and ways of life
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Yolanda, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 626 6679: I have heard that india is home to most of the best universities in the world  and the of quality education is also renowned. And also india has most of the best doctors in the world so I am assuming the same for its engineers. 
Amongst many other advantages i have heard that the cost of living is also low in India which is actually favourable for me.  

And also unlike other countries abroad india has a warm climate from what I have heard which is actually favourable for me since I have never lived in extremely cold conditions

This is also an opportunity for me to learn about different cultures and customs.
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have great awareness and knowledge, Yolanda. <This message was edited>

18/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Wow i am marvelled by the vast knowledge of india you have eqquiped me with
18/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 626 6679: No we are not
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Wow! India is much cheaper compared to the others
18/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Its actually a convenient way of learning if you ask me.

And if i get the scholarship I would love to become part of the earn while  you learn program.
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Yolanda.
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes I do agree to the sam Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 626 6679: I am glad to know all this Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Wow this makes higher studies sooo much affordable
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Yolanda
18/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Like we were discussing that only your efforts and hardwork matter.
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 626 6679: 1500 to 2250 dolars
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: You see Yolanda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes i think so too
18/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 626 6679: This arrangement is soo flexible
18/12/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
18/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Yes i understand them
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ma'am
18/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
18/12/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

18/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your parents too.
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you so much for this Ms Harmehak the twins have really boosted my trust and faith in Edoofa
18/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ma'am I will
18/12/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

18/12/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Yolanda!
18/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 626 6679: My pleasure Ma'am
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Yolanda and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
19/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 626 6679: Good morning Ms Harmehak

Yes may proceed please
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So Yolanda, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
19/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 626 6679: Ummm we discussed everything the pros and cons of me getting this scholarship but most of my parents' questions were answered by the PDFs you provided me with
For example their main question was what does Edoofa benefit from all of this? but however the PDF provided clarification on that.
19/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I am glad you all thoroughly followed the shared resources and had a great discussion, Yolanda. <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes Ms Harmehak
19/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
19/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes i have been able to connect with Mrs Magwaza and like you said her story is not only remarkable but inspiring and at the same time time a source of hope

I also connected her with my father but unfortunately I couldn't connect her with my mother because she's marking Zimsec examinations and they aren't allowed phones there and she's also working from another city which is far from Harare
19/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Oh alright please, however did your father have a thorough discussion?
19/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 626 6679: Yes we did
19/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

19/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 626 6679: Thank you Ms Harmehak watched it with pleasure
19/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Okay so Yolanda, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
19/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 626 6679: 1 I would be studying Mechanical engineering through the Edoofa program
2 Through the Edoofa program I would be pursuing my higher studies in India
3 The average cost is 6000 to 8000 dollars without the scholarship


4 if found eligible the annual fee would be around 2000 to 3000 dollars which can also be reduced to less than that by the EWYLP

5 The enrollment fee is three hundred and fifty dollars

6 you are expected to pay the fee within seven days but the program helps with an arrangement such that you can pay two hundred dollars in seven days and the rest one hundred and fifty dollars in thirty one days

 7 yes I am clear about the same
19/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Duly received Yolanda,

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

 *SECTION 5* 
IS IT TRUE THAT MANNY AFRICANS  HAVE POOR DIETS BECAUSE THEIR FARMS ARE STAGNANT AND IN EFFICIENT 

As much as it is true i it is also false for some other parts of the continent. In some parts of the continent people do have a poor diet due to the fact that their farms are stagnant and in efficient owing to the bad climate conditions in those areas. 
However contradictory to the topic at hand most Africans have poor diet due to lack of farming resources, in most cases Africans would have the field but would be lacking the tools, artificial fertilizers to mention just to mention a few. To generalize the matter, most of the Africans have a poor diet mainly due to poverty. 


Africans also have a poor diet because a larger part of them sorely relies on starchy foods like cassava, maize, and sorghum. These foods are often low in protein and micro nutrients which can lead to malnutrition. 

Then we have some people in rural and also in urban areas who have all the inputs but are generally just lazy and would rather have a poor diet than toilet hard in the fields for a balanced diet. 

A small part of Africa is limited to a certain type of diet, which we might come across as poor due to the weather conditions there which doesn't allow certain types of food crops to grow. 

My Inspirational story

Growing up i always did everything late, for example I had my first word late, took my first step late in comparison to the normal child. As much as it is unrelated you find that that maybe I am one of the  shortest people amongst my agemates. 

So due to my height I was ridiculed, bullied and looked down upon as a new form one student at Loretto high. This can shatter any one's self esteem but however I never allowed it to happen to me. I worked hard as a student to give my tall perpetrators a befitting reply.

I never allowed them to forget me be it teachers or students they all know and knew me as a class topper. My intelligence and excellency made the tall guys respect me as a person. 

The main lesson in my story is that we aren't limited to anything nommater how we look or what we have been through. We just have to wear that amour of confidence and work hard to outshine them all.
19/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Good afternoon Ms Harmehak
19/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon Yolanda
19/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Let me get it evaluated.
19/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ma'am
20/12/23, 9:19 am - Harmehak: Good morning Everyone, I hope you are doing well,

I have gotten your test evaluated and now I have your interview slots with me!

However, before I share the interview slots I would want to have a discussion with your parents regarding their preparation.

Are they currently available for the same?
20/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 626 6679: Good morning

Yes they are
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Great, can they please acknowledge the same too?
20/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 244 5652: Good morning lm Yolanda's father
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Clever.
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 244 5652: As Yolanda's father l confirm lm able to pay $350
20/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28 th December 2023 for $200 and the  27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 244 5652: I choose option number 1
20/12/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Sure Mr Clever!

Could you please answer using a voice note too?
20/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 244 5652: <Media omitted>
