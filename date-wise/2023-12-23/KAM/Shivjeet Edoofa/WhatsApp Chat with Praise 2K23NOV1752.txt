This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

01/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Noted

During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.

It has been a while now, and I am happy to let you know that I am back. Please, how are you doing today?
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 948 9559: lam doing great and you

14/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam ready
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
14/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes they are clear
14/12/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/12/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Lam following
14/12/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/12/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes that is clear
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes we can start

19/12/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Good evening to you too yes lam ready
19/12/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 948 9559: l agree and l was able to understand
19/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
19/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 948 9559: 2.Rights are things that a person is entitled to  for example one can have the right to vote and violating someone's rights is considered a serious offense whilst duties are things that a person is obligated to do , duties are responsibilities for example one is obligated to pay tax.  On the other hand human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to regardless of their nationality and where they come from these rights include the right to food ,human rights are fundamental and inalienable ,in other words they cannot be restricted or to be taken away whilst civil rights on the other hand are the rights and freedoms  that people have in relation to the government and society . In other words civil rights are specific to a particular country and civil rights are more specific and also civil rights can be changed or to be limited by the government. Right to vote is an example of civil rights and they vary from country to country unlike human rights that are universal.
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 948 9559: 3. A prosecutor is a legal professional who represents the government in criminal cases .In other words a prosecutor works for the government .A prosecutor's job is to bring criminal charges against against people who are suspected of committing crimes .In other words a prosecutor is the one who decides whether to charge someone with a crime and then prosecutes them in court.This can involve gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses and arguing the case in front of the judge or the jury.  A prosecutor's job is to seek justice not to win a case at all costs. On the other hand an attorney is a legal professional who can represent clients in both civil and criminal cases unlike a prosecutor who deals with criminal cases.An attorney may also be called a lawyer or a counsel. A lawyer or an attorney's job is to win the case at any cost . An attorney will be speaking on behalf of the client with the help of evidence gathered
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 948 9559: 4.Of the branches of   law lam more interested in civil law . Civil law is  quite different from criminal law . lam more interested in  civil law as it covers a wide range of non criminal disputes which include contract disputes, property disputes , personal injury claims and many more. They are many reasons as to why lam more interested in civil law and the reasons include ,civil law  typically offers a great chance of monetary compensation compared to criminal law and by any chance if l win a   civil case you might end up being awarded with money to compensate for your losses , secondly civil cases are less time consuming as they are resolved faster compared to criminal cases , thirdly civil cases are typically less emotional draining comparing with criminal cases and as for me l do not like  to be emotionally drained  with cases
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 948 9559: 5.There are a few and essential skills that are of paramount importance for one to be a successful lawyer and fortunately l possess those skills   . Firstly l have good communication skills because a lawyer has to be a good communicartor both verbally and in writing , for instance  if a lawyer has all the evidence needed but cannot  communicate well the chances of winning a case becomes low . Furthermore l possess the skills of problem solving and critical thinking , l think this skill is important as a lawyer sometimes deals with tricky cases and inorder to win the case one has to be a critical thinker and l also have the ability to think out of the box . In addition l also have strong research skills and l can even work under pressure and also lam a very organized person. Most importantly l have a passion for justice and lam committed in helping others.

20/12/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Praise!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam ready
20/12/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 274 5128: Greetings to you
My apology we got our salary late today.. Tomorrow will deposit the balance
20/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 274 5128: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the clarification with me. Please allow me to clarify this and come back to you very shortly.
20/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 274 5128: Noted
20/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that, the statement is correct and there was a clerical error on our end.
20/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 274 5128: Noted with thanks
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes that is accurate
20/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam
20/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
20/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes we do wish to have that
20/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Noted with thanks
21/12/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Praise!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam available
21/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l went through them
21/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes please
21/12/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 948 9559: That is well noted
21/12/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes l do agree
21/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 948 9559: l can see that
21/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Thank you
22/12/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
22/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Good evening to you too yes lam available
22/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
22/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
22/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
22/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
22/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 948 9559: That is right
22/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
22/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes please
22/12/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 30, 2023.
22/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
22/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
22/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 948 9559: The balance was deposited yesterday
22/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Yes
22/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 274 5128: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
22/12/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 948 9559: Noted with thanks
