Well l have been working on  being confident. I'm very detail-oriented, and I love to learn new things, but sometimes I get a little too caught up in the details and lose sight of the big picture. We are a family of four ..l have a young sister ,my mom and dad..well my parents and  l  belong to the middle class l mustn't say we are neither rich nor poor
My mom is a domestic worker in South Africa and my dad is a security guard in South Africa

It's wonderful to learn about your passion for netball and your commendable skills in problem-solving and teamwork at just 18 years old. Your family, which includes your parents, you, and your younger sister who is in grade 8 in South Africa, appears to be a tightly-knit and supportive group. As you anticipate your higher education journey abroad, it's heartening to know that you have the support of your parents, which is an invaluable asset in this endeavor.
18/12/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

20/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/12/23, 1:12 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure ma'am
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:22 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes I'm done
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure ma'am
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/12/23, 1:41 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure
20/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

21/12/23, 2:16 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am in 4 videos l understood that Students should be teachable and open minded and they should follow Edoofa 's instructions. What l also understood is that the Edoofa 's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the Seels program but it also focuses on increasing student's capacity for success making students more responsible and independent. Also the Edoofa had invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 2:19 pm - +27 63 826 9733: And also that the Statement of Purpose is an important document, students should be prompt in taking action, and be diligent in filling out the form
21/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the 4th video, I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.
21/12/23, 2:24 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Here they are ma'am
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/12/23, 2:28 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am all understood
21/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
21/12/23, 2:31 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
21/12/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

22/12/23, 12:36 pm - +27 63 826 9733: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:37 pm - +27 63 826 9733: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further
explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights

The main difference between rights and duties is that rights are things that we are entitled to, while duties are things that we are obligated to do. For example, as human beings, we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are things that we are entitled to as a matter of principle. On the other hand, we have duties to obey the law, pay our taxes, and respect the rights of others. These are things that we are obligated to do.
The difference between human rights and civil rights is that human rights are universal, they apply to all human beings. Civil rights are specific to certain groups or individuals within a country. For example, in Zimbabwe, we have the civil right to vote, regardless of race, gender, or religion. We also have the civil right to a fair trial. So civil rights are specific to a particular country or region, while human rights are universal.

An additional point of distinction is that human rights are considered fundamental, while civil rights are considered legal. In other words, human rights are things that we are considered to have by virtue of our humanity. They are not granted to us by any government or legal system. On the other hand, civil rights are granted by a government or legal system and can be changed or modified by those institutions.

Another way to look at the difference between human rights and civil rights is to think about the consequences of violating these rights. If human rights are violated, it is considered a violation of our basic humanity. This can lead to severe punishment, including imprisonment or even death. However, when civil rights are violated, the consequences are typically legal in nature, such as fines or imprisonment. So the consequences of violating human rights are much more severe than violating civil rights.
22/12/23, 12:38 pm - +27 63 826 9733: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney

A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their job is to present evidence and argue for a conviction in court. They are sometimes called district attorneys or assistant district attorneys, depending on the jurisdiction. On the other hand, an attorney is a lawyer who represents a client in court, regardless of whether it's a criminal or civil case. So while all prosecutors are attorneys, not all attorneys are prosecutors. An attorney can represent clients in civil matters, such as divorce or contract disputes, whereas a prosecutor only represents the government in criminal cases. 

One more key difference between prosecutors and attorneys is their approach to cases. Prosecutors are typically focused on winning their cases and getting convictions, whereas attorneys may have a broader range of goals. For example, an attorney representing a client in a divorce case may be focused on achieving a fair settlement that benefits their client. Or an attorney representing a client in a contract dispute may be focused on getting the client the compensation they deserve. So while both prosecutors and attorneys represent clients in court, their motivations and goals may be very different.
22/12/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Unathi.

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. I appreciate you sharing the session date and time with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
22/12/23, 12:39 pm - +27 63 826 9733: 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal,
and why

I'm passionate about helping people resolve their differences and find a fair and equitable solution. I believe that civil law is the best way to achieve this, as it allows for negotiation and compromise, rather than strict adherence to the law. I want to use my skills and knowledge to help individuals and organizations reach an agreement that is beneficial to all parties involved.

I have skills and qualities that  would make me well-suited to a career in civil law. For example, l have  strong communication skills, ability to listen to and understand both sides of an argument, and  problem-solving skills.l also have a desire to help others, l have patience and empathy, and  ability to see things from multiple perspectives.

I want to share an example of a case that have inspired me to pursue a career in civil law. For example,  there is  a  case that l read about, that made me realize the importance of resolving disputes fairly and equitably. l feel bad when I see injustice happening in the world, and l want to make a difference by helping people resolve their conflicts.
22/12/23, 12:40 pm - +27 63 826 9733: 5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please
elaborate with an example

I believe  skills and qualities l have that will make me a successful lawyer are that l have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. I also have strong research and analytical skills, in order to be able to understand complex legal issues and synthesize information from multiple sources. I have strong public speaking skills, that will help me to be able to present a case in court with confidence and conviction.I have a good understanding of human behavior, in order to be able to empathize with clients and build rapport with them
 
I have an ability to think critically and solve complex problems. I have a willingness to put in long hours, since cases often require a lot of time and effort to prepare for. I have the ability to work well under pressure and handle stress, since the legal profession can be very demanding and fast paced. I have an emotional intelligence, including empathy and the ability to remain under pressure.

22/12/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/12/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/12/23, 7:01 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct? <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 7:04 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/12/23, 7:09 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
22/12/23, 7:13 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/12/23, 7:14 pm - +27 63 826 9733: So the food and Accomodation fee will be 1000 both or in singles
22/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/12/23, 7:14 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay now l understand
22/12/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The food accommodation both are included.
22/12/23, 7:16 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 7:17 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay thank you
22/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/12/23, 7:19 pm - +27 63 826 9733: So I'm the one who is supposed to pay for my flight expenses
22/12/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27638269733 yes you are absolutely correct.
22/12/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/12/23, 7:31 pm - +27 63 826 9733: No ma'am
22/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
22/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
22/12/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 7:33 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Thank you ma'am
22/12/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
22/12/23, 7:36 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am definitely and thank you so much
22/12/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
22/12/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
22/12/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
22/12/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
22/12/23, 8:33 pm - +27 63 826 9733: I have ma'am
22/12/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
22/12/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
22/12/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Unathi, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
22/12/23, 8:35 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
22/12/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
22/12/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/12/23, 8:59 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
22/12/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/12/23, 9:02 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/12/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/12/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/12/23, 9:04 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
22/12/23, 9:06 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Please provide me with more information on it
22/12/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
22/12/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
22/12/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
22/12/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
22/12/23, 9:08 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
22/12/23, 9:10 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes
22/12/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/12/23, 9:11 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes l do
22/12/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
22/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
22/12/23, 9:15 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes
22/12/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
22/12/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
22/12/23, 9:17 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes
22/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
22/12/23, 9:18 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay
22/12/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/12/23, 9:21 pm - +27 63 826 9733: No ma'am I'm good
22/12/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
22/12/23, 9:25 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
22/12/23, 9:28 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Thank you ma'am
